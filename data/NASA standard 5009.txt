NONDESTRUCTIVE EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS FOR
FRACTURE-CRITICAL METALLIC COMPONENTS

1.

SCOPE

1.1

Purpose

This NASA Technical Standard establishes the nondestructive evaluation (NDE) requirements
for any NASA system or component, flight or ground, where fracture control and a quantitative
demonstration of probability of detection (POD) are required. This Standard defines the primary
requirements for NDE in support of NASA-STD-5019A with Changes, Fracture Control
Requirements for Spaceflight Hardware. NDE applied in-process for purposes of process control
and NDE of damage-tolerant composites are not addressed in this Standard.
It is the policy of NASA to produce aerospace flight systems with a high degree of reliability and
safety. This is accomplished through good design, manufacturing, test, and operational practices,
including the judicious choice of materials, detailed analysis, appropriate factors of safety,
rigorous testing and control of hardware, and reliable inspection. NASA fracture control
requirements stipulate that all human-rated aerospace flight systems be subjected to fracture
control procedures to preclude catastrophic failure. Those procedures frequently rely on NDE to
ensure that the potential failure initiation of relevant crack-like flaws is not present in critical
areas.
Programs that are not human-rated may choose to impose these requirements on a mission or
hardware to increase the robustness of a structural design or to serve as a stepping-stone for
human-rating.
1.2

Applicability

1.2.1 This Standard is applicable to the fracture control of metal components (e.g., aluminum,
steel, titanium, and nickel alloys) for any NASA system or component, flight or ground, where
fracture control is a requirement.
For additively manufactured (AM) components, refer to NASA-STD-6030, Additive
Manufacturing Requirements for Spaceflight Systems.
The requirements described herein apply to fracture-critical hardware developed for NASA
applications by NASA Field Centers, international partners, contractors, and outside
organizations. NDE processes are required to meet the requirements in this Standard to screen
hardware reliably for the presence of crack-like flaws.

Agency documents. This language applies to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (a Federally Funded
Research and Development Center), other contractors, recipients of grants, cooperative
agreements, or other agreements only to the extent specified or referenced in the applicable
contracts, grants, or agreements.
1.2.3 References to “this Standard” refer to NASA-STD-5009C; references to other documents
state the specific document information.
1.2.4 Verifiable requirement statements are designated by the acronym NER (Nondestructive
Evaluation Requirement), numbered, and indicated by the word “shall.” This Standard contains 74
requirements. To facilitate requirements selection by NASA programs and projects, a Requirements
Identification Matrix is provided in Appendix A.
1.2.5 Explanatory or guidance text is indicated in italics beginning in section 4. The terms “may”
or “can” denote discretionary privilege or permission, “should” denotes a good practice and is
recommended but not required, “will” denotes expected outcome, and “are/is” denotes descriptive
material or a statement of fact.
1.3

Capability Demonstration Specimens: A set of specimens made from material similar to the
material of the hardware to be inspected with known flaws used to estimate the capability of flaw
detection, i.e., Probability of Detection.
Certification: A written statement by an employer that an individual has met the applicable
requirements of this Standard. (Source: NAS 410)
Contrast: The difference between the average signal value in a specific region and the average
signal value in a neighboring region.
Cracks or Crack-Like Flaws: A discontinuity assumed to behave like a crack for assessment of
material or structural integrity.
Flaw: An imperfection or discontinuity that may be detectable by nondestructive testing and is
not necessarily rejectable. Examples of flaws in metallic materials include cracks, deep scratches
and sharp notches that behave like cracks, material inclusions, forging laps, welding incomplete
fusion, penetration, and slag or porosity with a crack-like tail.
Fracture Control: The rigorous application of those branches of design engineering, quality
assurance, manufacturing, and operations dealing with the analysis and prevention of crack
propagation leading to catastrophic failure.
Fracture-Critical Hardware, Component, or Part: Fracture control classification that
identifies a part whose individual failure, caused by the presence of a crack, is a catastrophic
hazard and that requires safe-life analysis or other fracture control assessment to be shown
acceptable for flight. A part is fracture critical unless it can be shown that there is no credible
possibility for a flaw to cause failure during its lifetime or the part failure does not result in a
credible catastrophic hazard. Assessments for fracture critical parts include damage tolerance
analysis, damage tolerance test, or defined approaches for specific categories. Parts under this
classification receive flaw screening by NDE, proof test, or process control and are subjected to
traceability, materials selection and usage, documentation, and engineering drawing
requirements.
Hardware Developer: The organization, NASA or prime contractor, responsible for the design,
development, and manufacturing of hardware that is subject to fracture control.
Instrument Standardization: Adjustment of an NDE instrument response using an appropriate
reference standard with known size discontinuities such as electro-discharged machined slots and
flat bottom holes, to obtain or establish a known and reproducible response. This is usually done
prior to an examination but can be carried out anytime there is concern about the examination or
instrument response. It is also commonly known as calibration prior to initiating an NDE
procedure.

Material Review Board: After non-conforming material has been identified, this board reviews
it and determines whether or not the material should be returned, reworked, used as-is, or
scrapped. Note: The Material Review Board (MRB) consists of representatives across many
disciplines, including manufacturing engineering, materials engineering, quality, etc.
Naturally Occurring Flaw: A flaw that is present in a component as a result of the normally
occurring manufacturing processes or usage of the component as compared to NDE simulated
flaws such as electrical discharge machining (EDM) notches, flat bottom holes, engineered
cracks, etc.
NDE Plan: A plan that describes the process for establishment, implementation, and control of
NDE of aerospace flight hardware during design, manufacturing, and its operational life.
NDE Procedure: A written plan providing detailed information on “how-to” perform a
hardware-specific inspection.
NDE Reference Standard: A material or object for which all relevant chemical and physical
characteristics are known and measurable, used as a comparison for, or standardization of,
equipment or instruments used for nondestructive testing.
90/95 Probability of Detection (POD 90/95): Refers to 90% probability of flaw detection with a
95% lower confidence bound.
Nondestructive Evaluation: The development and application of technical methods to examine
materials or components in ways that do not impair future usefulness and serviceability to detect,
locate, measure, and evaluate flaws; to assess integrity, properties, and composition; and to
measure geometrical characteristics. This is to include nondestructive inspection and testing.
Pie Gauge: A tool for quickly verifying the direction of magnetic flux on a surface. Pie gauges
are not acceptable for measuring field intensities.
Qualification: The skills, training, knowledge, examinations, experience, and visual capability
required for personnel to properly perform to a particular level.
Quantitative Quality Indicator: Magnetic particle test pieces with artificial flaws used to verify
proper field direction and adequate field strength.
Reference Document: Written, printed, or electronic matter that is useful as background
information for the reader to help in understanding the subject matter but does not constitute
technical requirements of the Standard.
Reliably Detectable Flaw Size: The size of a crack-like flaw that can be detected with at least
90% POD with 95% confidence (i.e., 90/95 POD). For Standard NDE, reliably detectable flaw
sizes are provided in Tables 1 and 2. For Special NDE, the reliably detectable flaw size must be

demonstrated through POD testing using the methods cited within this Standard. When
determined using the MIL-HDBK-1823A, Nondestructive Evaluation System Reliability
Assessment, POD method, this flaw size will be the minimum reliably detectable flaw size,
denoted a90/95. Reliably detectable flaw sizes are assumed to exist in a part for the purpose of
performing a damage tolerance safe-life analysis of the part, component, or assembly.
Responsible Fracture Control Board (RFCB): The designated board at the NASA Center or
sponsoring institution responsible for fracture control methodology that can interpret fracture
control requirements.
Responsible NASA Center: A group of designated multi-discipline representatives as
designated by the responsible program office that has the authority to develop, interpret, and
approve fracture control requirements and the responsibility for overseeing and approving the
technical adequacy of all fracture control activities.
Responsible NDE Engineering: The NDE engineering organization of the hardware developer
or the sustaining engineering organization responsible for the engineering aspect of fracturecritical NDE during manufacturing or operations and maintenance.
Sensitivity Level: A scale used to assess the quality of a penetrant of radiographic inspection.
Similarity: The case where it has been established either by engineering judgement or
quantitative data analysis that a one-to-one transfer function exists between the original NDE
POD study and the specific NDE inspection situation at hand. Differences between the
inspection configurations that might be assessed in similarity analysis include factors such as
surface finish, accessibility, material type, geometry, and orientation.
Simulated Fabricated Flaw: A flaw that is intentionally placed in a component for the purpose
of generating an NDE signal response. These can be produced by a variety of material removal
processes (e.g., cutting, drilling, EDM, laser notching, plasma focused ion beam notching) or
additive material-forming processes.
Simulated Induced Flaw: A flaw that is intentionally placed in a component for the purpose of
generating an NDE signal response. Induced flaws are produced by intentional loading (thermal,
mechanical, etc.) to induce damage (e.g., cracks, delaminations, disbonds).
Special NDE: Nondestructive inspections of fracture-critical hardware that are capable of
detecting cracks or crack-like flaws smaller than those assumed detectable by Standard NDE or
do not conform to the requirements for Standard NDE as set forth in this Standard. Special NDE
methods are not limited to fluorescent penetrant, radiography, ultrasonic, eddy current, and
magnetic particle.
Standard NDE: NDE methods for which conservative reliably detectable flaw sizes were
established by POD demonstration testing performed by multiple inspectors. For the Standard

NASA-STD-5009C
NDE flaw sizes, it is assumed that qualified inspectors can provide the required 90/95 POD
without additional POD demonstration testing. Current Standard NDE methods include
fluorescent penetrant, radiographic (film), ultrasonic, eddy current, and magnetic particle testing.
Sustaining Engineering: The organization, NASA or prime contractor, responsible for operation
and maintenance of hardware that is subject to fracture control.
Technical Authority: A representative delegated by the contracting agency to address technical
matters and who is responsible for the interpretation and implementation of the requirements set
forth in this Standard.

NDE REQUIREMENTS

The requirements set forth in this Standard are the minimum NDE requirements for metallic
fracture-critical hardware. The application of Standard and Special NDE per the requirements
of this Standard does not exempt fracture-critical hardware from routine NDE performed during
manufacturing. The fracture control NDE procedures cited herein may exceed the requirements
for NDE procedures that are routinely performed for purposes such as configuration control and
process control. NASA-STD-5019A with Changes provides the definition of fracture-critical
hardware for all spaceflight systems.
4.1

Standard NDE

[NER 1] Standard NDE shall consist of nondestructive inspections of traditional (non-AM)
metal components (e.g., aluminum, steel, titanium, and nickel alloys) using the NDE methods
cited in Table 1, Reliably Detectable Flaw Sizes for Fracture Analysis Based on Standard NDE
Methods (Millimeters), or Table 2, Reliably Detectable Flaw Sizes for Fracture Analysis Based
on Standard NDE Methods (Inches), or additional methods that have been demonstrated by
section 4.1.5 in this Standard and approved by the RFCB or delegated NASA Technical
Authority.
The Reliably Detectable Flaw Sizes shown in Table 1 and Table 2 can be assumed as starting
points in the damage tolerance fracture analyses and are applicable only for metals (not to
include AM metals). The crack geometries for the cracks in Table 1 or Table 2 are shown in
Figure 3, Assumed Flaw Geometries.
4.1.1 Standard NDE Crack Sizes
[NER 2] Nondestructive inspections of fracture-critical hardware shall detect the initial crack
sizes used in the damage tolerance fracture analyses with a capability of minimum 90%
probability of detection at a 95% confidence level, known as 90/95.
The Standard NDE flaw sizes for eddy current, penetrant, magnetic particle, radiography, and
ultrasonic techniques are shown in Table 1 and Table 2. The table entries are based primarily on
APPROVED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE – DISTRIBUTION IS UNLIMITED
16 of 54

NASA-STD-5009C
NDE capability studies conducted on flat specimens with open surface, partially through, etched
fatigue cracks that were evaluated by multiple inspectors from multiple contractors early in the
Space Shuttle Program. See Bishop (1973). The studies were performed on wrought steel for the
magnetic particle method and on 2219-T87 aluminum panels for the other NDE methods.
Bishop’s detectable flaw sizes for the penetrant method were the basis of the Shuttle Orbiter
Fracture Control Plan’s (King and Johnson [1974]) definition of Standard NDE flaw sizes since
it was the predominant NDE method in use at the time. Bishop’s POD estimates were averaged
over a range of aspect ratio cracks. The translation of Bishop’s study results to the Standard
NDE flaw sizes was based on both quantitative and qualitative analysis of the data. These
original Orbiter Standard NDE flaw sizes evolved into later NASA Standards, including MSFCSTD-1249, Standard NDE Guidelines and Requirements for Fracture Control Programs, and
eventually in this Standard through the consideration of additional POD studies and engineering
judgement as well as structural analysis of additional crack configurations. The Standard NDE
flaw sizes in Tables 1 and 2 are considered to meet the 90/95 capability requirement. A more
detailed history can be found in NASA/TM−20220013820, NESC-TI-21-01657, A Survey of
NASA Standard Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE).
Since the Standard NDE flaw sizes were derived from a single flaw type and limited specimen
parameters, the application of these flaw sizes to other geometries, materials, material forms,
and material processes is based on a rationale of similarity to a specific fracture critical
component. Similarity can be established by POD studies, using the method described in
NASA/TM−20220003648, Guidebook for Assessing Similarity and Implementing Empirical
Transfer Functions for Probability of Detection (POD) Demonstrations for Signal Based
Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE) Methods, or engineering rationale approved by the RFCB.
For example, a flat panel may be considered representative of a component with a large
diameter curvature. Also, it may be considered reasonable to use the Standard NDE flaw sizes
for most aerospace wrought alloys. Conversely, the Standard NDE flaw sizes may not apply to
thick-section components; threaded parts; weldments; compressively loaded structures; double
wall radiography; and other unique material, structural, or inspection applications.
If similarity to Standard NDE flaw sizes cannot be established, the Standard NDE flaw sizes may
also be transferred to estimate the detectable flaw size in a specific flight component using
NASA/TM−20220003648, specifically, the inverse transfer function method.
If similarity to Standard NDE cannot be established and an inverse transfer function cannot be
applied, a Special NDE demonstration can be performed using naturally occurring flaws in
flight component geometry to demonstrate 90/95 capability (see section 4.2 in this Standard).
For example, a Special NDE demonstration using penetrant to evaluate the capillary action in
fatigue cracks on a curved flight-representative component may confirm similarity of using
penetrant on a curved part compared to a flat specimen.
If a sufficient number of naturally occurring flaws in flight component geometry are not
available for a Special NDE demonstration, a representative flaw type, flaw size, and specimen

Special NDE demonstrations be performed with simulated induced flaws (e.g., fatigue cracks)
rather than fabricated flaw (e.g., EDM notches) to better represent flaw-to-flaw variability.
4.1.2 Standard NDE Classification Justification
[NER 3] The justification to classify an NDE procedure as a Standard NDE procedure shall be
documented and approved by NDE engineering and the delegated NASA Technical Authority.
4.1.3 Demonstration of Standard NDE Capability
[NER 4] Instrument standardization shall be performed.
Implementation of Standard NDE methods in accordance with the requirements in section 4.1.4

4.1.4 Standard NDE Methods
4.1.4.1

Eddy Current

Standard eddy-current inspection was only applied to nonmagnetic, nonferromagnetic, and
conductive metals in our early capability databases. With approval from NDE Engineering or
the delegated NASA Technical Authority, inspection of some ferromagnetic materials can be
considered Standard.
4.1.4.1.1 [NER 5] Eddy-current inspections shall be in accordance with SAE ARP4402, Eddy
Current Inspection of Open Fastener Holes in Aluminum Aircraft Structure; SAE AS4787, Eddy
Current Inspection of Circular Holes in Nonferrous Metallic Aircraft Engine Hardware; or
NASA fracture control and NASA NDE Engineering-approved contractor internal specifications
with the following additional requirements:
a. [NER 6] For part conductivities less than 10% International Annealed Copper
Standard (IACS), the reference standard shall have a conductivity of ±2% IACS with a
minimum reference standard conductivity of 0.8% IACS.
As given in SAE ARP4402, pay special attention to ensure that the conductivity of the reference
standard matches the conductivity of the part to be inspected within ±15% of the IACS.

Fluorescent Penetrant

[NER 11] Fluorescent Penetrant inspection shall be in accordance with ASTM E1417/E1417M,
Standard Practice for Liquid Penetrant Testing; SAE AMS2647, Fluorescent Penetrant

Sensitivity Level 4 Fluorescent Penetrants to Detect Fatigue Cracks in Various Metals.)
4.1.4.2.2

Mechanically Disturbed Surfaces

[NER 13] Mechanically disturbed or wire EDM surfaces shall be etched or electropolished
prior to the penetrant inspection and at an appropriate time in the manufacturing flow.
The final penetrant inspection can be performed prior to metal finishing operations such as
buffing or sanding that do not by themselves produce flaws. It should be noted that these final
finishing operations may create a mechanically disturbed surface that could impede subsequent
(nonconformance resolution and/or service life) penetrant inspections and thus require etching.
4.1.4.2.3

Etching/Electropolishing Procedure

a. [NER 14] An etching/electropolishing procedure shall be developed, approved, and
controlled to prevent part damage.
b. [NER 15] The etching/electropolishing procedure shall specify the minimum
amount of material to be removed to ensure that smeared metal does not mask cracks.

c. [NER 18] If etching/electropolishing is not feasible or the minimum depths are not
attainable, it shall be demonstrated and documented that the required flaw size can be reliably
detected following current machining processes.
When very close tolerances are required, critical surfaces should be machined near final
dimensions, etched and inspected, then finish machined and dye penetrant inspected without
further etch.
4.1.4.2.4

Special Considerations

Tables 1 and 2 reliably detectable flaw sizes do not specify a minimum part thickness or edge or
hole crack sizes when a fillet radius is present.
[NER 19] Interpretation of reliably detectable flaw sizes for thin parts with thickness less than
0.64 mm (0.025 in) or edges and holes with a fillet radius shall require approval by the RFCB.
Refer to NASA/TM-20230000318, Guidelines for Mapping Reliably Detectable Dye Penetrant
Crack Size at External Corners with Fillet Radii, for estimating reliably detectable flaw sizes on
external corners.
4.1.4.3

Magnetic Particle

[NER 20] Magnetic particle inspections shall be in accordance with ASTM E1444/E1444M,
Standard Practice for Magnetic Particle Testing for Aerospace, or NASA fracture control and
NASA NDE Engineering-approved contractor internal specifications.
4.1.4.3.1 [NER 21] The magnetic particle inspection shall be the wet, fluorescent, continuous,

Cut Type CX4-230 and CX4-430 QQIs into four individual QQIs. Ensure QQIs are in intimate
contact with the inspection surface with the notches facing down and the “+” notches aligned
with the required magnetization directions.
Hall probes are acceptable provided they are verified with a QQI. Pie gauges are not acceptable
for measuring field intensities.
4.1.4.4

Radiography (X-Ray)

Table 1 or Table 2 minimum detectable crack size for standard radiographic processes is based
solely on film x-ray radiography and represents NASA’s past radiographic capability
demonstrations on metallic specimens. With the conversion to digital radiographic techniques
and methods, it is essential to assess the capability of such systems to meet the Tables 1 and 2
requirements.
4.1.4.4.1 [NER 24] A POD study shall be used to establish the capability of digital
radiographic techniques, including computed radiography, digital radiography, and computed
tomography which at this time are considered to be Special NDE.
4.1.4.4.2 [NER 25] A POD study shall be used to establish the capability of Gamma radiation
source inspections which are considered special NDE.
For radiographic inspections, surface cracks are assumed to be oriented normal to the surface
unless otherwise indicated in the inspection callouts.
4.1.4.4.3 [NER 26] Film radiographic inspections, with capabilities shown in Table 1 or
Table 2, shall be in accordance with ASTM E1742/E1742M, Standard Practice for Radiographic
Examination, or NASA fracture control and NASA NDE Engineering-approved contractor
internal specifications with the following additional requirements:
a. [NER 27] The minimum radiographic inspection sensitivity level shall be 2-1T.
The requirement for sensitivity level 2-1T is in accordance with industry specifications
for similar applications, namely NAVAIR 01-1A-34, Aeronautical Equipment Welding,
and European Space Agency ECSS‐E‐ST‐32‐01C, Fracture Control.
b. [NER 28] Film density shall be 2.5 to 4.0.

APPROVED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE – DISTRIBUTION IS UNLIMITED
21 of 54

NASA-STD-5009C
The requirement for 2.5 to 4.0 film density, while more stringent than the requirements of
ASTM E1742/E1742M, is intended to optimize contrast for flaw detection for most films
used in aerospace hardware inspection. This is because the gradient values of these films
(change in density in response to a small change in exposure values caused by flaw
conditions) are generally highest in the required density range.
c. [NER 29] The local x-ray axis of the radiation beam shall be within
±5 degrees of the assumed crack plane orientation.
For flat parts only, with the center axis of the beam perpendicular to the part, the area of the
film that falls within a ±5-degree cone of radiation (10-degree total solid angle, i.e., 2 𝜽, apex at
the radiation source, central axis of the cone equal to the central axis of the radiation beam) will
be considered valid for interpretation. See Figure 1, Flat Part X-ray Shot Geometry.

Figure 1—Flat Part X-ray Shot Geometry
For a cylindrical shape with a crack perpendicular to the side wall running in the axial direction
(length of the tube), the local direction of the radiation beam to that crack would be defined as
“𝜷” as shown in Figure 2, Curved Part X-ray Shot Geometry.

Ultrasonics

[NER 30] Utrasonic inspections for wrought products shall be in accordance with ASTM
E2375, Standard Practice for Ultrasonic Testing of Wrought Products; ASTM E164, Standard
Practice for Contact Ultrasonic Testing of Weldments; or NASA fracture control and NASA
NDE Engineering-approved contractor internal specifications with the following additional
requirements:
a. [NER 31] Any single discontinuity with a response greater than 50% of the response
from a 1.98-mm (0.078-in) diameter flat bottom hole (or equivalent surface notch or side drilled
hole) at the estimated discontinuity depth (or sound path) shall be reported.
Rationale: This requirement is different from that in ASTM E2375 where response greater than
the response from a 1.98-mm (0.078-in) diameter flat-bottom hole or equivalent notch at the
estimated discontinuity depth and the discontinuity size given is not acceptable. Such
requirement only provides 50% POD in detection of the 1.98-mm (0.078-in) diameter flat-bottom
hole equivalent reflector which is the Standard ultrasonic testing flaw size flaw. Therefore, a
lower response or the decision threshold at 50% of the response from a 1.98-mm (0.078-in)
diameter flat-bottom hole or equivalent is used to provide targeted POD/Confidence of minimum
90/95.
b. [NER 32] Multiple discontinuities with indications greater than the response from a
1.19-mm (0.047-in) diameter flat bottom hole (or equivalent surface notch or side drilled hole) at
the estimated discontinuity depth (or sound path) shall be reported if the centers of any two such
indications are separated by less than 25.4 mm (1 in).

c. [NER 33] Any linear discontinuity (i.e., cracks or crack-like flaws such as stringers,

response from a 1.19-mm (0.047-in) diameter flat bottom hole (or equivalent surface notch or
side drilled hole) at the estimated discontinuity depth (or sound path) shall be reported regardless
of length.
4.1.5 Method for Introducing New Standard NDE Flaw Sizes
4.1.5.1
[NER 34] A Standard NDE POD study shall consist of a MIL-HDBK-1823Acompliant POD study that is conducted by a minimum of 10 inspectors that form a representative
sample from a specific population of inspectors.
4.1.5.2
[NER 35] Individual inspector analyses shall be performed in accordance with MILHDBK-1823A methods and reported.
4.1.5.3
[NER 36] Individual inspector probability of false-calls (POF) shall be reported and
are recommended to not exceed 1% POF with 50% confidence.
4.1.5.4
[NER 37] The Standard NDE flaw size shall be estimated as a function of the average
and standard deviation of individual inspector a90/95 flaw sizes and represent the flaw size that
90% of inspectors are expected to demonstrate at least 90/95 detection capability.
4.1.5.5
[NER 38] Approval of the study design, execution, and analysis, or waivers from
these parameters, shall be subject to review and approval of the RFCB.
Adding Standard NDE flaw sizes for other techniques not included in Tables 1 and 2 or revisions
to flaw sizes can be established based on the requirements of this section. MIL-HDBK-1823A is
the primary reference for the design, execution, and analysis of the individual inspector POD
studies conducted within a NASA Standard NDE study. Additional guidance that augments and
adapts MIL-HDBK-1823A for Standard NDE is contained in NASA/TM−20220013822, NESCTI-21-01657, Guidebook for the Design and Analysis of a NASA Standard Nondestructive
Evaluation (NDE) Probability of Detection (POD) Study. It exploits the advantage of having
prior POD studies in planning a Standard NDE POD study and provides considerations in how
to define the inspector population and sampling strategies for selecting inspectors.
NASA/TM−20220013822 recommends an approach to estimate the Standard NDE flaw size that
provides 90% coverage of the inspector population.
4.1.6 Inability to Meet Standard NDE Inspection Process Requirements
[NER 39] If the requirements of section 4.1 of this Standard cannot be met or smaller cracks or
crack-like flaws than those shown in Table 1 or Table 2 have to be detected, the inspection
processes shall be considered Special NDE, and the Special NDE requirements of section 4.2 of
this Standard apply.

Special NDE

4.2.1 General
Special NDE consists of nondestructive inspections that are capable of detecting crack-like flaws
smaller than those detectable by Standard NDE (Table 1 or Table 2) or those that do not
conform to the requirements for Standard NDE given in section 4.1 of this Standard.
Special NDE methods are not limited to fluorescent penetrant, radiography, ultrasonic, eddy
current, and magnetic particle methods.
Special NDE provides minimum 90/95 POD/Confidence in detection capability.
[NER 40] All Special NDE certification processes of NASA partners, contractors, subcontractors, and suppliers shall be approved by RFCB.
4.2.2 Special NDE Crack Sizes
[NER 41] Special NDE inspections shall require the approval of the RFCB and the delegated
NASA Technical Authority.
The Special NDE crack size can be any demonstrated size.
4.2.3 Demonstration of Special NDE Capability
a. [NER 42] A 90/95% flaw detection capability shall be demonstrated before a
Special NDE inspection can be performed for fracture-critical part screening.
The demonstration of the Special NDE inspection at a given crack size qualifies the Special NDE
for implementation for the detection of cracks at the demonstrated size and larger.
b. [NER 43] The capability tests shall be designed and conducted based on the MILHDBK-1823A POD Method (section 4.2.3.1 of this Standard), the Binomial Point Estimate POD
Method (section 4.2.3.2 of this Standard), the Limited-Sample POD method (section 4.2.3.3 of
this Standard), or other method approved by the RFCB.
Use the MIL-HDBK-1823A POD Method to demonstrate the smallest flaw size that the NDE
method and inspector can demonstrate with the required 90/95 POD/Confidence. A large
number of flawed specimens are recommended when using the POD methods (i.e., 40-60). The
Binomial Point Estimate and Limited-Sample POD Methods are to be used when it is only
necessary to demonstrate that the NDE method and inspector can provide at least 90/95
POD/Confidence for a specific target flaw size. The Binomial Point Estimate POD Method can
be applied to either hit-miss NDE data or signal response NDE data that have been converted to

hit/miss and require a minimum of 29 flawed specimens. The Limited-Sample POD method can
only be used for signal response NDE data and requires a minimum of ten flawed specimens.
4.2.3.1

NDE Qualification Using the MIL-HDBK-1823A POD Methods

[NER 44] NDE qualification using the MIL-HDBK-1823 POD methods shall be performed in
accordance with MIL-HDBK-1823A.
This method requires a range of flaw sizes that span the targeted qualification flaw size. The
large number of flaws required by this method is intended to allow estimation of the reliably
detectable flaw size, a90/95 and the complete POD curve (or model). Qualification by this method
demonstrates that the procedure and the individual operator are capable of reliably detecting
flaws larger than or equal to the estimated a90/95 flaw size.
ASTM E2862-18, Standard Practice for Probability of Detection Analysis for Hit/Miss Data, and
ASTM E3023-21, Standard Practice for Probability of Detection Analysis for â Versus a Data,
define procedures for performing the statistical analysis of hit/miss data and signal-response
data, respectively, to estimate the demonstrated POD based on MIL-HDBK-1823A’s
methodology.
4.2.3.2

NDE Qualification Using Binomial Point Estimate POD Method

[NER 45] NDE qualification using the Binomial Point Estimate Method (PEM) shall be
performed in accordance with Materials Evaluation (ME), Vol. 40, No. 9, pp 922-932, 1982,
adapted for a single flaw size interval, and the target flaw size is equal to or larger than the
maximum flaw size in the set or a flaw set approved by the RFCB.
This method qualifies that an individual inspector achieves at least 90/95 detection capability for
a specified target flaw size. The Binomial PEM method assumes that flaw detection capability
increases with flaw size in the neighborhood of the target flaw size.
The Binomial PEM does not estimate the minimum flaw size that provides 90/95 detection, which
differs from the objective of the ME (1982). This method adapts the guidance in ME (1982) to
one flaw size interval containing a minimum of 29 flaws with a maximum flaw size equal to the
target flaw size. If the maximum flaw size exceeds the target, then basing the demonstration on
the average of the flaw sizes could be considered if the average is not larger than the target size.
The range of flaw sizes in the set is small enough to accept the assumption that the POD function
is either concave in the region or does not markedly depart from being linear. The number of
unflawed inspection sites (or opportunities) is recommended to be a minimum of three times the
number of flawed sites in accordance with MIL-HDBK-1823A, which is an increase from the ME
(1982) guidance. Therefore, a minimum of 29 flawed and 87 unflawed inspection sites are to be
randomly presented to each inspector. Per MIL-HDBK-1823A, an unflawed inspection site need
not be a separate specimen. There should be at least one blank specimen in the set when using
the Binomial Point Estimate Method. There should be no indication of a specimen’s flaw state
APPROVED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE – DISTRIBUTION IS UNLIMITED
26 of 54

NASA-STD-5009C
(i.e., flawed or unflawed) or flaw location(s) on the specimen that may enhance detection
capability. Successful demonstration of 90/95 detection capability requires that all 29 flaw
opportunities are detected with an acceptably low false call rate.
If there are no more than 1 missed detection of the 29 flaws, a continuation of the demonstration
activity may be warranted by adding 17 flaws to the inspection set, resulting in a total of 46
flaws. Successful demonstration of 90/95 detection capability requires that 45 of the 46 flaws are
detected with an acceptably low false call rate.
The demonstration specimens should be representative or conservative relative to the operational
components to be inspected, including material, surface finish, flaw type, flaw location, and flaw
spatial frequency and proximity. If similarity (i.e., a 1-1 transfer function) cannot be justified, a
transfer function may be developed according to NASA/TM−20220003648.
4.2.3.3

NDE Qualification Using Limited Sample POD Method

[NER 46] NDE qualification using the limited sample probability of detection (LS POD) method
shall be performed in accordance with NASA/TM−20210018515/Corrected Copy, NESC-TI-2001545, Guidebook for Limited Sample Probability of Detection (LS-POD) Demonstration for
Signal-Response Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE) Methods.
This method is also applicable to a single target flaw size but is limited to NDE methods that
produce a signal response correlated to flaw size. The LS POD method assumes that the
capability of flaw detection increases with the size of flaws in the neighborhood of the target flaw
size. In addition to signal response data from flawed specimens, noise data (i.e., signals from
specimens or inspection opportunities where no flaw exists) are necessary for this method.
Qualification by this method demonstrates that the procedure and operator are capable of
reliably detecting flaws larger than or equal to the target flaw size.
4.2.4 NDE Capability Demonstration Specimens
[NER 47] Special NDE demonstration specimen design shall be justified and approved by the
RFCB or the delegated NASA Technical Authority based on the similarity or transfer function
between the test hardware and the demonstration specimen and documented in the NDE
Summary Report.
Ideally, Special NDE capability demonstrations would be performed with naturally occurring
flaws of the type and size specified by the fracture control plan in representative specimens of the
actual component geometry and field inspection access restrictions. Seldom are enough
specimens available with flaw sizes that are independently verified for a Special NDE capability
demonstration. Historically, simulated flaws have been used in component representative or
simplified specimens, such as plates, cylinders, or tubes. Simulated flaws may be induced, such
as cracks induced by fatigue or thermal loading, or fabricated by material removal methods such
as EDM machining or laser notching, or by AM methods. Simulated induced flaws such as
APPROVED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE – DISTRIBUTION IS UNLIMITED
27 of 54

NASA-STD-5009C
fatigue cracks should be used for Special NDE capability demonstration as they are typically
conservative to naturally occurring flaws with respect to flaw features such as crack opening
that affect the signal response produced by NDE methods. In special cases, other flaws such as
simulated fabricated flaws that are more representative of the naturally occurring flaws for the
specific application may be used for the demonstration with the approval of the RFCB and the
delegated NASA Technical Authority. The preparation and control of demonstration specimens
and how to administer demonstration tests should meet the intent of MIL-HDBK-1823A, PEM,
or LS-POD.
