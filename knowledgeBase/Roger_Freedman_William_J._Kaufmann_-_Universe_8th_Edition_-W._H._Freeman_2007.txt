To Lee Johnson Kaufmann and
Caroline Robillard-Freedman,
strong survivors
and to the memory of
S/Sgt. Ann Kazmierczak Freedman, WAC

About the Authors
Roger A. Freedman is on the faculty of the Department of Physics at the University of California, Santa
Barbara. He grew up in San Diego, California and was an
undergraduate at the University of California campuses in
San Diego and Los Angeles. He did his doctoral research in
nuclear theory and its astrophysical applications at
Stanford University under the direction of Professor J.
Dirk Walecka. Dr. Freedman came to UCSB in 1981 after
three years of teaching and doing research at the University of Washington.
Dr. Freedman holds a commercial pilot’s license, and when not teaching or writing he can frequently be found flying with his wife, Caroline.
He has flown across the United States and Canada.

William J. Kaufmann III was the author of the first four editions
of Universe. Born in New York City on December 27, 1942, he often
visited the magnificent Hayden Planetarium as he was growing up.
Dr. Kaufmann earned his bachelor’s degree magna cum laude in physics
from Adelphi University in 1963, a master’s degree in physics from
Rutgers in 1965, and a Ph.D. in astrophysics from Indiana University in
1968. At 27 he became the youngest director of any major planetarium
in the United States when he took the helm of the Griffith Observatory
in Los Angeles. During his career he also held positions at San Diego
State University, UCLA, Caltech, and the University of Illinois. Throughout his professional life as a scientist and educator, Dr. Kaufmann
worked to bridge the gap between the scientific community and the
general public to help the public share in the advances of astronomy.
A prolific author, his many books include Black Holes and Warped
Spacetime, Relativity and Cosmology, The Cosmic Frontiers of General
Relativity, Exploration of the Solar System, Planets and Moons, Stars
and Nebulas, Galaxies and Quasars, and Supercomputing and the
Transformation of Science. Dr. Kaufmann died in 1994.

Preface

stronomy is one of the most dynamic and exciting areas of modern science.
Recent discoveries have shown us previously unseen worlds in the frigid outer
depths of our solar system, given us insight into the dramatic ways in which the
most massive stars can collapse into black holes, and allowed us to see the universe
as it was more than thirteen billion years ago. But studying astronomy is much more
than just learning a collection of amazing facts: It is also discovering the nature of
the scientific way of knowing and understanding how scientists work and think.
Bill Kaufmann wrote the first four editions of Universe with
the goal of giving students real insight into the nature of science.
Since taking over stewardship of Universe in 1996, I’ve continued Bill’s program and added an additional goal of helping students develop problem-solving skills. With these goals in mind,
An overview of our present-day understanding of how the
solar system formed.
I’ve introduced some new features to this Eighth Edition while
strengthening well-received features from earlier editions.

New features of the Eighth Edition help
students focus on key topics
Students need to find specific topics when studying for exams or doing homework. They also benefit from reminders of what the key
topics are within a section of the book. New features of the Eighth
Edition that identify the key topics are designed to help students
with both of these.

New COSMIC CONNECTIONS figures
summarize key ideas visually
Many students learn more through visual presentations than from
reading long passages of text. To help these students I’ve added
large figures, called Cosmic Connections, to most chapters in the
Eighth Edition. These give an overview or summation of a particular important topic in a chapter. Subjects range from the variety of
modern telescopes to the formation of the solar system; from the
scale of distances in the Universe to the life cycles of stars; and from
the influence of gravitational tidal forces to the evolution of the
Universe after the Big Bang. The Cosmic Connections figures also
convey some of the excitement and adventure that lead students to
study astronomy in the first place.

Preface

New “Motivation Statements” connect detailed
discussion to the broader picture
As students read a science text, they often wonder “What is the key idea? How does it
relate to the discussion on previous pages? What motivated scientists to make these
observations and deductions?” To address these questions, I’ve added to each section a
free-standing Motivation Statement—a brief sentence that shows students how that section’s material fits in with the larger picture of astronomy presented in the chapter. Some
statements deal with the scientific method. Others compare topics in one section with
those in another section or chapter; still other statements give a quick summary of a section’s conclusion.

Streamlined coverage of planets focuses the student on
comparative planetology and highlights the interplay
of planetary surfaces and atmospheres
Two chapters on comparative planetology were introduced in the Seventh Edition:
Chapter 7, Our Solar System, and Chapter 8, The Origin of the Solar System. I’ve
revised and updated these chapters with the latest information, including the new official distinctions between planets and dwarf planets. In addition, I’ve combined the chapters on Mercury, Venus, and Mars into a single Chapter 11 on the terrestrial planets to
emphasize their similarities to Earth and to each other, and I’ve added comparative planetology figures to several other chapters. As in previous editions, each planet’s surface
and atmosphere are discussed
in tandem, where other texts
address them separately. This
underscores their interrelationships and builds a deeper
understanding of the planets’
overall characteristics.

hese images show the three planets that share the inner solar system with our Earth. All three have solid surfaces, and,
in principle, a properly protected astronaut could stand on
any of them. The differences between these three worlds, however, are pronounced.
Mercury is small, airless, and extensively cratered. It is also
mysterious: Half of its surface has never been viewed at close
range, and it has a perplexing and unexpected magnetic field. It
also rotates in a manner unique in the solar system, spinning three
times on its axis for every two orbits around the Sun.
Venus is nearly the same size as Earth, but it is shrouded by
a perpetual cloud cover that hides its surface from view. To penetrate the clouds and learn what lies beneath, two advanced technologies were needed: radar, which allowed astronomers to “see”

through the clouds, and unmanned spacecraft, which orbited
Venus at close range and even landed on its surface. The falsecolor topographic map shown here reveals that Venus has no true
continents but merely highlands (shown in red) that rise gently
above the planet’s lower-lying areas (shown in blue). We have
also learned that Venus’s atmosphere is thick and searing hot, and
that its clouds contain droplets of corrosive sulfuric acid.
Mars has captivated the popular imagination like no other
planet. But rather than being the abode of warlike aliens, Mars
proves to be an enigmatic world. Some parts of its surface are
drier than any desert on Earth, while other locations show evidence of having been underwater for extended periods. Our challenge is to understand how these three nominally Earthlike worlds
evolved to be so unique and so different than our own Earth.

Learning Goals
11-1 What astronomers have learned by observing the
terrestrial planets from Earth

11-5 How geologic activity took a very different form on
Venus than on Earth, and why it essentially stopped on
Mars

11-2 The radically different ways in which Mercury, Venus,
and Mars rotate on their axes

11-6 The key differences among the atmospheres of Earth,
Venus, and Mars

11-3 The outstanding features of Mercury, and why its
magnetic field came as a surprise

11-7 How the atmospheres of Earth, Venus, and Mars evolved
to their present states

11-4 How the advent of the space age transformed our
understanding of Venus and Mars

11-8 The evidence that there was once liquid water on Mars

By reading the sections of this chapter, you will learn

11-9 What we know about the two small satellites of Mars

Preface

An expanded program of explanatory art
Many new figures in the Eighth Edition continue
the practice of adding balloon captions to help students interpret complex figures. Many photos also
contain brief labels to point out the most important
relevant features.

1. From point 1 to point 4,
Mars appears to move eastward
against the background of stars
as seen from Earth
(direct motion).

2. As Earth passes Mars in its
orbit from point 4 to point 6,
Mars appears to move westward
against the background of stars
(retrograde motion).

3. From point 6 to point 9, Mars
again appears to move eastward

A revised selection of Observing Projects
The CD-ROM that comes free (upon request) with this text contains the Starry Night
Enthusiast™ planetarium software from Imaginova Inc. Every chapter of the Eighth
Edition of Universe includes one or more Observing Projects that use this software package; many of these projects are new or revised. As in the Seventh Edition, many projects are accompanied by an Observing Tips and Tools box to provide help and guidance.

?

Additional features have been retained
from previous editions
Three versions of the text meet the needs of different instructors
In addition to the complete 28-chapter version of Universe, two shorter versions are
also available. Universe: The Solar System, Third Edition, includes Chapters 1-16 and
28; it omits the chapters on stars, stellar evolution, galaxies, and cosmology. Universe:
Stars and Galaxies, Third Edition, includes Chapters 1-8 and 16-28; it omits the
detailed chapters on the solar system but includes the overview of the solar system in
Chapters 7 and 8.

Many people think that the Earth is closer to the Sun in summer than in winter and

However, these “common sense” ideas are incorrect (as explained in Chapters 2 and 3).

When learning new astronomical ideas, it can be helpful to relate them to more familiar
experiences on Earth. Throughout Universe, Analogy paragraphs make these connections. For example, the motions of the planets can be related to children on a merry-goround, and the bending of light through a telescope lens is similar to the path of a car
driving from firm ground onto sand.

little reading compared to a literature or history course—at least in terms of
the number of pages. But your readings will be packed with information, much of it new
to you and (I hope) exciting. You can’t read this textbook like a novel and expect to learn
much from it. Don’t worry, though. I wrote this book with you in mind. In this section
I’ll suggest how Universe can help you succeed in your astronomy course, and take you
on a guided tour of the book and media.

Apply these techniques to studying astronomy
• Read before each lecture You’ll get the most out of your astronomy course if
you read each chapter before hearing a lecture about its subject matter. That
way, many of the topics will already be clear in your mind, and you’ll understand the lecture better. You’ll be able to spend more of your listening and
note-taking time on the more challenging ideas presented in the lecture.
• Take notes as you read and make use of office hours Keep a notebook
handy as you read, and write down the key points of each section so that you
can review them later. If any parts of the section don’t seem clear on first
reading, make a note of them, too, including the page numbers. Once you’ve
gone through the chapter, re-read it with special emphasis on the ideas that gave
you trouble the first time. If you’re still unsure after the lecture, consult your
instructor, either during office hours or after class. Bring your notes with you
so your instructor can see which concepts are giving you trouble. Once your
instructor has helped clarify things for you, revise your notes so you’ll remember
your new-found insights. You’ll end up with a chapter summary in your own
words. This will be a tremendous help when studying for exams!
• Make use of your fellow students Many students find it useful to form study
groups for astronomy. You can hash out challenging topics with each other and
have a good time while you’re doing it. But make sure that you write up your
homework by yourself, because the penalties for copying or plagiarizing other
students’ work can be severe in the extreme. Some students find individual
assistance useful too. If you think a tutor will be helpful, link up with one early.
Getting a tutor late in the course, in the belief that you’ll be able to catch up
with what you missed earlier on, is almost always a lost cause.

To the Student

• Take advantage of the Web site and eBook Take some time to explore the
Universe Web site (www.whfreeman.com/universe8e). There you’ll find review
materials, animations, videos, interactive exercises, flashcards, and many other
features keyed to chapters in Universe. All of these features are designed to help
you learn and enjoy astronomy, so make sure to take full advantage of them.
Your instructor may also have asked you to purchase the eBook version of this
textbook (www.ebooks.bfwpub.com), which combines the complete content of
the book and the Web site in a convenient online format.
• Try astronomy for yourself with your star charts At the back of this book
you’ll find a set star charts for the each month of the year in the Northern
Hemisphere. (For a set of Southern Hemisphere star charts, see the Universe
Web site.) Star charts can get you started with your own observations of the
universe. Hold the chart overhead in the same orientation as the compass
points, with southern horizon toward the south and western horizon toward
the west. (To save strain on your arms, you may want to cut these pages out of
the book.) Depending on the version of this textbook that your instructor
requested, this book may also include a CD-ROM with the easy-to-use Starry
Night Enthusiast™ planetarium program, which you can use to view the sky on
any date and time as seen from anywhere on Earth.

Before you study Universe, take this quiz
Universe has many features designed to help you succeed in your study of astronomy.

Here’s the most important advice of all
I haven’t mentioned the most important thing you should do when studying astronomy: Have fun! Of all the different kinds of scientists, astronomers are among the most
excited about what they do and what they study. Let some of that excitement about
the universe rub off on you, and you’ll have a great time with this course and with this
textbook.
In preparing this edition of Universe, I’ve tried very hard to make it the kind of textbook that a student like you will find useful. I’m very interested in your comments and
opinions! Please feel free to send me e-mail or write me, and I will respond personally.
Best wishes for success in your studies!

forces. Modern science is a direct descendant of the intellectual
endeavors of these ancient Greek pioneers.

CAUTION! In everyday language the word “theory” is often
used to mean an idea that looks good on paper, but has little to
do with reality. In science, however, a good theory is one that
explains reality very well and that can be applied to explain new
observations. An excellent example is the theory of gravitation
(Chapter 4), which was devised by the English scientist Isaac

N

Like art, music, or any other human creative activity, science
makes use of intuition and experience. But the approach used by
scientists to explore physical reality differs from other forms of
intellectual endeavor in that it is based fundamentally on observation, logic, and skepticism. This approach, called the scientific
method, requires that our ideas about the world around us be
consistent with what we actually observe.
The scientific method goes something like this: A scientist trying to understand some observed phenomenon proposes a hypothesis, which is a collection of ideas that seems to explain what
is observed. It is in developing hypotheses that scientists are at
their most creative, imaginative, and intuitive. But their hypotheses must always agree with existing
observations and experiments, beHypotheses, models,
cause a discrepancy with what is obtheories, and laws are
served implies that the hypothesis is
wrong. (The exception is if the sci- essential parts of the
entist thinks that the existing results scientific way of knowing
are wrong and can give compelling
evidence to show that they are wrong.) The scientist then uses
logic to work out the implications of the hypothesis and to make
predictions that can be tested. A hypothesis is on firm ground
only after it has accurately forecast the results of new experiments
or observations. (In practice, scientists typically go through these
steps in a less linear fashion than we have described.)
Scientists describe reality in terms of models, which are hypotheses that have withstood observational or experimental tests.
A model tells us about the properties and behavior of some object or phenomenon. A familiar example is a model of the atom,
which scientists picture as electrons orbiting a central nucleus.
Another example, which we will encounter in Chapter 18, is a
model that tells us about physical conditions (for example, temperature, pressure, and density) in the interior of the Sun (Figure
1-1). A well-developed model uses mathematics—one of the most
powerful tools for logical thinking—to make detailed predictions.
For example, a successful model of the Sun’s interior should describe what the values of temperature, pressure, and density are
at each depth within the Sun, as well as the relations between
these quantities. For this reason, mathematics is one of the most
important tools used by scientists.
A body of related hypotheses can be pieced together into a
self-consistent description of nature called a theory. An example
from Chapter 4 is the theory that the planets are held in their orbits around the Sun by the Sun’s gravitational force (Figure 1-2).
Without models and theories there is no understanding and no
science, only collections of facts.

WE

The Scientific Method

Figure 1-1

RI V UXG

Our Star, the Sun The Sun is a typical star. Its diameter is
about 1.39 million kilometers (roughly a million miles), and its
surface temperature is about 5500°C (10,000°F). A detailed scientific
model of the Sun tells us that it draws its energy from thermonuclear
reactions occurring at its center, where the temperature is about 15
million degrees Celsius. (NSO/AURA/NSF)

Newton in the late 1600s to explain the orbits of the six planets known at that time. When astronomers of later centuries discovered the planets Uranus and Neptune and the dwarf planet
Pluto, they found that these planets also moved in accordance
with Newton’s theory. The same theory describes the motions
of satellites around the Earth as well as the orbits of planets
around other stars (see Chapter 8).
An important part of a scientific theory is its ability to make
predictions that can be tested by other scientists. If the predictions
are verified by observation, that lends support to the theory and
suggests that it might be correct. If the predictions are not verified, the theory needs to be modified or completely replaced. For
example, an old theory held that the Sun and planets orbit around
a stationary Earth. This theory led to certain predictions that
could be checked by observation, as we will see in Chapter 4. In
the early 1600s the Italian scientist Galileo Galilei used one of the
first telescopes to show that these predictions were incorrect. As
a result, the theory of a stationary Earth was rejected, eventually
to be replaced by the modern picture shown in Figure 1-2 in
which the Earth and other planets orbit the Sun.
An idea that cannot be tested by observation or experiment
does not qualify as a scientific theory. An example is the idea that
there is a little man living in your refrigerator who turns the inside light on or off when you open and close the door. The little

Astronomy and the Universe

Figure 1-2
Planets Orbiting the Sun An example of a scientific
theory is the idea that the Earth and planets orbit the Sun
due to the Sun’s gravitational attraction. This theory is
universally accepted because it makes predictions that
have been tested and confirmed by observation. (The Sun
and planets are actually much smaller than this illustration
would suggest.) (Detlev Van Ravenswaay/Science Photo
Library)

man is invisible, weightless, and makes no sound, so you cannot
detect his presence. While this is an amusing idea, it cannot be
tested and so cannot be considered science.
Skepticism is an essential part of the scientific method. New
hypotheses must be able to withstand the close scrutiny of other
scientists. The more radical the hypothesis, the more skepticism
and critical evaluation it will receive from the scientific community, because the general rule in science is that extraordinary
claims require extraordinary evidence. That is why scientists as a
rule do not accept claims that people have been abducted by
aliens and taken aboard UFOs. The evidence presented for these
claims is flimsy, secondhand, and unverifiable.
At the same time, scientists must be open-minded. They must
be willing to discard long-held ideas if these ideas fail to agree
with new observations and experiments, provided the new data
have survived evaluation. (If an alien spacecraft really did land on
Earth, scientists would be the first to accept that aliens existed—
provided they could take a careful look at the spacecraft and its
occupants.) That is why scientific knowledge is always provisional. As you go through this book, you will encounter many
instances where new observations have transformed our understanding of Earth, the planets, the Sun and stars, and indeed the
very structure of the universe.
Theories that accurately describe the workings of physical reality have a significant effect on civilization. For example, basing
his conclusions in part on observations of how the planets orbit
the Sun, Isaac Newton deduced a set of fundamental principles
that describe how all objects move. These theoretical principles,
which we will encounter in Chapter 4, work equally well on
Earth as in the most distant corner of the universe. They represent our first complete, coherent description of the behavior of
the physical universe. Newtonian mechanics had an immediate
practical application in the construction of machines, buildings,

and bridges. It is no coincidence that the Industrial Revolution
followed hard on the heels of these theoretical and mathematical
advances inspired by astronomy.
Newtonian mechanics and other physical theories have stood
the test of time and been shown to have great and general validity. Proven theories of this kind are collectively referred to as the
laws of physics. Astronomers use these laws to interpret and understand their observations of the universe. The laws governing
light and its relationship to matter are of particular importance,
because the only information we can gather about distant stars
and galaxies is in the light that we receive from them. Using the
physical laws that describe how objects absorb and emit light, astronomers have measured the temperature of the Sun and even
learned what the Sun is made of. By analyzing starlight in the
same way, they have discovered that our own Sun is a rather ordinary star and that the observable universe may contain billions
of stars just like the Sun.

Technology in Science
An important part of science is the development of new tools for
research and new techniques of observation. As an example, until fairly recently everything we knew about the distant universe
was based on visible light. Astronomers would peer through telescopes to observe and analyze visible starlight. By the end of the
nineteenth century, however, scientists had begun discovering
forms of light invisible to the human eye: X rays, gamma rays, radio waves, microwaves, and ultraviolet and infrared radiation.
As we will see in Chapter 6, in recent years astronomers have
constructed telescopes that can detect such nonvisible forms of
light (Figure 1-3). These instruments give us views of the universe
vastly different from anything our eyes can see. These new views
have allowed us to see through the atmospheres of distant planets,

Chapter 1

RI V UXG

A Telescope in Space Because it orbits outside the Earth’s
atmosphere in the vacuum of space, the Hubble Space
Telescope (HST) can detect not only visible light but also ultraviolet and
near-infrared light coming from distant stars and galaxies. These forms of
nonvisible light are absorbed by our atmosphere and hence are difficult or
impossible to detect with a telescope on the Earth’s surface. This photo
of HST was taken by the crew of the space shuttle Columbia after a
servicing mission in 2002. (NASA)

to study the thin but incredibly violent gas that surrounds our
Sun, and even to observe new solar systems being formed around
distant stars. Aided by high-technology telescopes, today’s astronomers carry on the program of careful observation and logical analysis begun thousands of years ago by their ancient Greek
predecessors.

The star we call the Sun and all unique Earth
the celestial bodies that orbit the
Sun—including Earth, the other eight planets, all their various
moons, and smaller bodies such as asteroids and comets—make
up the solar system. Since the 1960s a series of unmanned spacecraft has been sent to explore each of the planets (Figure 1-4). Using the remote “eyes” of such spacecraft, we have flown over
Mercury’s cratered surface, peered beneath Venus’s poisonous
cloud cover, and discovered enormous canyons and extinct volcanoes on Mars. We have found active volcanoes on a moon of
Jupiter, probed the atmosphere of Saturn’s moon Titan, seen the
rings of Uranus up close, and looked down on the active atmosphere of Neptune.
Along with rocks brought back by the Apollo astronauts
from the Moon (the only world beyond Earth yet visited by humans), new information from spacecraft has revolutionized our
understanding of the origin and evolution of the solar system. We
have come to realize that many of the planets and their satellites
were shaped by collisions with other objects. Craters on the Moon
and on many other worlds are the relics of innumerable impacts
by bits of interplanetary rock. The Moon may itself be the result
of a catastrophic collision between the Earth and a planet-sized
object shortly after the solar system was formed. Such a collision
could have torn sufficient material from the primordial Earth to
create the Moon.
The oldest objects found on Earth are meteorites, bits of interplanetary debris that sometimes fall to our planet’s surface. By
using radioactive age-dating techniques, scientists have found that
all meteorites are 4.56 billion years old—older than any other
rocks found on Earth or the Moon. The conclusion is that our entire solar system, including the Sun and planets, formed 4.56 billion years ago. The few thousand years of recorded human history
is no more than the twinkling of an eye compared to the long history of our solar system.
The discoveries that we have made in our journeys across the
solar system are directly relevant to the quality of human life on
our own planet. Until recently, our understanding of geology,
weather, and climate was based solely on data from the Earth.

knowledge gives us valuable insight into our origins, the nature of
our planetary home, and the limits of our natural resources.

1-3 By studying stars and nebulae,
astronomers discover how stars are born,
grow old, and die
The nearest of all stars to Earth is the Sun. Although humans have
used the Sun’s warmth since the dawn of our species, it was only
in the 1920s and 1930s that physicists figured out how the Sun
shines. At the center of the Sun, thermonuclear reactions—so
called because they require extremely high temperatures—convert
hydrogen (the Sun’s primary constituent) into helium. This violent process releases a vast amount of energy, which eventually
makes its way to the Sun’s surface and escapes as light (see Figure 1-1). All the stars you can see in the nighttime sky also shine
by thermonuclear reactions (Figure 1-5). By 1950 physicists could
reproduce such thermonuclear reactions here on Earth in the form
of a hydrogen bomb (Figure 1-6). While such weapons are capable of destroying life on our planet, peaceful applications of this
same process may provide a clean source of energy sometime in
the next several decades.

Figure 1-6

RI V UXG

A Thermonuclear Explosion A hydrogen bomb uses the same physical
principle as the thermonuclear reactions at the Sun’s center: the
conversion of matter into energy by nuclear reactions. This thermonuclear
detonation on October 31, 1952, had an energy output equivalent to
10.4 million tons of TNT. This is a mere ten-billionth of the amount of
energy released by the Sun in one second. (Defense Nuclear Agency)

Thermonuclear reactions consume the material of which stars
are made, which means that stars cannot last forever. Rather,
they must form, evolve, and eventually die.

CAUTION! Astronomers often use biological terms such as
“birth” and “death” to describe stages in the evolution of inanimate objects like stars. Keep in mind that such terms are used
only as analogies, which help us visualize these stages. They are
not to be taken literally!

The Life Stories of Stars

Figure 1-5

RI V UXG

Stars like Grains of Sand This Hubble Space Telescope image shows
thousands of stars in the constellation Sagittarius. Each star shines
because of thermonuclear reactions that release energy in its interior.
Different colors indicate stars with different surface temperatures: stars
with the hottest surfaces appear blue, while those with the coolest
surfaces appear red. (The Hubble Heritage Team, AURA/STScI/NASA)

The rate at which stars emit energy in the form of light tells us
how rapidly they are consuming their thermonuclear “fuel,” and
hence how long they can continue to shine before reaching the
end of their life spans. More massive stars have more thermonuclear “fuel,” but consume it at such a prodigious rate that they
live out their lives in just a few million years. Less massive stars
have less material to consume, but their thermonuclear reactions
proceed so slowly that their life spans are measured in billions of
years. (Our own star, the Sun, is in early middle age: it is 4.56
billion years old, with a lifetime of 121⁄2 billion years.)
While no astronomer can watch a single star go through all
of its life stages, we have been able to piece together the life stories of stars by observing them at different points in their life cycles. Important pieces of the puzzle have been discovered by
studying huge clouds of interstellar gas, called nebulae (singular
nebula), which are found scattered across the sky. Within some

are far more massive than the Sun end their lives with a spectacular detonation called a supernova (plural supernovae) that blows
the star apart. The Crab Nebula (Figure 1-8) is a striking example of a remnant left behind by a supernova.
Dying stars can produce some of the strangest objects in the
sky. Some dead stars become pulsars, which spin dizzily at rates
of tens or hundreds of rotations per second. And some stars end
their lives as almost inconceivably dense objects called black
holes, whose gravity is so powerful that nothing—not even light—
can escape. Even though a black hole itself emits essentially no
radiation, a number of black holes have been discovered by Earthorbiting telescopes. This is done by detecting the X rays emitted
by gases falling toward a black hole.
During their death throes, stars return the gas of which they
are made to interstellar space. (Figure 1-8 shows these expelled
gases expanding away from the site of a supernova explosion.)

Figure 1-8

The Crab Nebula—Wreckage of an Exploded Star When a
dying star exploded in a supernova, it left behind this elegant
funeral shroud of glowing gases blasted violently into space. A thousand
years after the explosion these gases are still moving outward at about

light-years from Earth and about 13 light-years across. (NASA, ESA,

This gas contains heavy elements—that is, elements heavier than
hydrogen and helium—that were created during the star’s lifetime
by thermonuclear reactions in its interior. Interstellar space thus
becomes enriched with newly manufactured atoms and molecules.
The Sun and its planets were formed from interstellar material
that was enriched in this way. This means that the atoms of iron
and nickel that make up the body of the Earth, as well as the carbon in our bodies and the oxygen we breathe, were created deep
inside ancient stars. By studying stars and their evolution, we are
really studying our own origins.

1-4 By observing galaxies, astronomers
learn about the origin and fate of the universe

The Orion Nebula—Birthplace of Stars This beautiful
nebula is a stellar “nursery” where stars are formed out of the
nebula’s gas. Intense ultraviolet light from newborn stars excites the
surrounding gas and causes it to glow. Many of the stars embedded in
this nebula are less than a million years old, a brief interval in the lifetime
of a typical star. The Orion Nebula is some 1500 light-years from Earth
and is about 30 light-years across. (NASA, ESA, M. Robberto/STScI/ESA,
and the Hubble Space Telescope Orion Treasury Project Team)

Stars are not spread uniformly across the universe but are grouped
together in huge assemblages called galaxies. Galaxies come in a
wide range of shapes and sizes. A typical galaxy, like the Milky
Way, of which our Sun is part, contains several hundred billion
stars. Some galaxies are much smaller, containing only a few million stars. Others are monstrosities that devour neighboring galaxies in a process called “galactic cannibalism.”

Our Milky Way Galaxy has arching spiral arms like those of
the galaxy shown in Figure 1-9. These arms are particularly active sites of star formation. In recent years, astronomers have discovered a mysterious object at the center of the Milky Way with
a mass millions of times greater than that of our Sun. It now
seems certain that this curious object is an enormous black hole.
Some of the most intriguing galaxies appear to be in the
throes of violent convulsions and are rapidly expelling matter.
The centers of these strange galaxies, which may harbor even
more massive black holes, are often powerful sources of X rays
and radio waves.
Even more awesome sources of energy are found still deeper
in space. At distances so great that their light takes billions of
years to reach Earth, we find the mysterious quasars. Although
quasars look like nearby stars (Figure 1-10), they are among the
most distant and most luminous objects in the sky. A typical
quasar shines with the brilliance of a hundred galaxies. Detailed
observations of quasars imply that they draw their energy from
material falling into enormous black holes.

The motions of distant galaxies reveal that they are moving away
from us and from each other. In other words, the universe is expanding. Extrapolating into the past, we learn that the universe

Angles and Angular Measure (a) Angles are measured in degrees (°).
There are 360° in a complete circle and 90° in a right angle. For example,
the angle between the vertical direction (directly above you) and the
horizontal direction (toward the horizon) is 90°. The angular diameter of
the full moon in the sky is about 1⁄2°. (b) The seven bright stars that make

say that the angular diameter (or angular size) of the Moon is 1⁄2°.
Alternatively, astronomers say that the Moon subtends an angle
of 1⁄2°. Ten full moons could fit side by side between the two
pointer stars in the Big Dipper.
The adult human hand held at arm’s length provides a means
of estimating angles, as Figure 1-12 shows. For example, your fist
covers an angle of 10°, whereas the tip of your finger is about 1°
wide. You can use various segments of your index finger extended
to arm’s length to estimate angles a few degrees across.

1-5 Astronomers use angles to denote the
positions and apparent sizes of objects
in the sky
Whether they study planets, stars, galaxies, or the very origins of
the universe, astronomers must know where to point their telescopes. For this reason, an important part of astronomy is keeping track of the positions of objects in the sky. Angles and a
system of angular measure are essential parts for this aspect of astronomy (Figure 1-11).
An angle is the opening between
two
lines that meet at a point. AnAngular measure is a
gular measure describes the size of
tool that we will use
an angle exactly. The basic unit of
throughout our study of
angular measure is the degree, desigastronomy
nated by the symbol °. A full circle
is divided into 360°, and a right angle measures 90° (Figure 1-11a). As Figure 1-11b shows, if you
draw lines from your eye to each of the two “pointer stars” in the
Big Dipper, the angle between these lines—that is, the angular distance between these two stars—is about 5°. (In Chapter 2 we will
see that these two stars “point” to Polaris, the North Star.) The
angular distance between the stars that make up the top and bottom of the Southern Cross, which is visible from south of the
equator, is about 6° (Figure 1-11c).
Astronomers also use angular measure to describe the apparent size of a celestial object—that is, what fraction of the sky that
object seems to cover. For example, the angle covered by the diameter of the full moon is about 1⁄2° (Figure 1-11a). We therefore

Estimating Angles with Your Hand The adult human hand extended to
arm’s length can be used to estimate angular distances and angular sizes
in the sky.

Astronomy and the Universe

To talk about smaller angles, we subdivide the degree into 60
arcminutes (also called minutes of arc), which is commonly abbreviated as 60 arcmin or 60⬘. An arcminute is further subdivided
into 60 arcseconds (or seconds of arc), usually written as 60 arcsec or 60⬙. Thus,
1° ⫽ 60 arcmin ⫽ 60⬘
1⬘ ⫽ 60 arcsec ⫽ 60⬙
For example, on January 1, 2007, the planet Saturn had an

BOX 1-1

angular diameter of 19.6 arcsec as viewed from Earth. That is a
convenient, precise statement of how big the planet appeared in
Earth’s sky on that date. (Because this angular diameter is so
small, to the naked eye Saturn appears simply as a point of light.
To see any detail on Saturn, such as the planet’s rings, requires a
telescope.)
If we know the angular size of an object as well as the distance to that object, we can determine the actual linear size of the
object (measured in kilometers or miles, for example). Box 1-1
describes how this is done.

Tools of the Astronomer’s Trade

The Small-Angle Formula
ou can estimate the angular sizes of objects in the sky with
your hand and fingers (see Figure 1-12). Using rather more
Y
sophisticated equipment, astronomers can measure angular
sizes to a fraction of an arcsecond. Keep in mind, however,
that angular size is not the same as actual size. As an example,
if you extend your arm while looking at a full moon, you can
completely cover the Moon with your thumb. That’s because
from your perspective, your thumb has a larger angular size
(that is, it subtends a larger angle) than the Moon. But the actual size of your thumb (about 2 centimeters) is much less than
the actual diameter of the Moon (more than 3000 kilometers).
The accompanying figure shows how the angular size of
an object is related to its linear size. Part a of the figure shows
that for a given angular size, the more distant the object, the
larger its actual size. For example, your thumb held at arm’s
length just covers the full moon; the angular size of your thumb
and the Moon are about the same, but the Moon is much farther away and is far larger in linear size. Part b shows that for
a given linear size, the angular size decreases the farther away
the object. This is why a car looks smaller and smaller as it
drives away from you.
We can put these relationships together into a single mathematical expression called the small-angle formula. Suppose
that an object subtends an angle ␣ (the Greek letter alpha) and
is at a distance d from the observer, as in part c of the figure.
If the angle ␣ is small, as is almost always the case for objects
in the sky, the linear size (D) of the object is given by the following expression:

The following examples show two different ways to use
the small-angle formula. In both examples we follow a fourstep process: Evaluate the situation given in the example, decide which tools are needed to solve the problem, use those
tools to find the answer to the problem, and review the result
to see what it tells you. Throughout this book, we’ll use these
same four steps in all examples that require the use of formulas. We encourage you to follow this four-step process when
solving problems for homework or exams. You can remember
these steps by their acronym: S.T.A.R.

EXAMPLE: On December 11, 2006, Jupiter was 944 million
kilometers from Earth and had an angular diameter of 31.2
arcseconds. From this information, calculate the actual
diameter of Jupiter in kilometers.

Situation: The astronomical object in this example is Jupiter,
and we are given its distance d and its angular size ␣ (the
same as angular diameter). Our goal is to find Jupiter’s

Tools: The equation to use is the small-angle formula, which
relates the quantities d, ␣, and D. Note that when using this
formula, the angular size ␣ must be expressed in arcseconds.

What is the greatest distance at which you could see details

Situation: Now the object in question is a person, whose
linear size D we know. Our goal is to find the distance d at
which the person has an angular size ␣ equal to 1 arcsec.

Tools: Again we use the small-angle formula to relate d, ␣,

Review: Does our answer make sense? From Appendix 2 at
the back of this book, the equatorial diameter of Jupiter
measured by spacecraft flybys is 142,984 km, so our
calculated answer is very close.

Review: This is much less than the distance to the Moon,
which is 384,000 km. Thus, even the best telescope on Earth
could not be used to see an astronaut walking on the surface
of the Moon.

1-6 Powers-of-ten notation is a useful
shorthand system for writing numbers
Astronomy is a subject of extremes. Astronomers investigate the
largest structures in the universe, including galaxies and clusters
of galaxies. But they must also study
atoms and atomic nuclei, among the Learning powers-of-ten
smallest objects in the universe, in notation will help you
order to explain how and why stars deal with very large and
shine. They also study conditions very small numbers
ranging from the incredibly hot and
dense centers of stars to the frigid near-vacuum of interstellar
space. To describe such a wide range of phenomena, we need an
equally wide range of both large and small numbers.

Powers-of-Ten Notation: Large Numbers
Astronomers avoid such confusing terms as “a million billion billion” by using a standard shorthand system called powers-of-ten
notation. All the cumbersome zeros that accompany a large number are consolidated into one term consisting of 10 followed by
an exponent, which is written as a superscript. The exponent indicates how many zeros you would need to write out the long
form of the number. Thus,
100 ⫽ 1 (one)
101 ⫽ 10 (ten)
102 ⫽ 100 (one hundred)
103 ⫽ 1000 (one thousand)

104 ⫽ 10,000 (ten thousand)
106 ⫽ 1,000,000 (one million)
109 ⫽ 1,000,000,000 (one billion)
1012 ⫽ 1,000,000,000,000 (one trillion)
and so forth. The exponent also tells you how many tens must be
multiplied together to give the desired number, which is why the
exponent is also called the power of ten. For example, ten thousand can be written as 104 (“ten to the fourth” or “ten to the
fourth power”) because 104 ⫽ 10 ⫻ 10 ⫻ 10 ⫻ 10 ⫽ 10,000.
In powers-of-ten notation, numbers are written as a figure
between one and ten multiplied by the appropriate power of ten.
The approximate distance between Earth and the Sun, for example, can be written as 1.5 ⫻ 108 kilometers (or 1.5 ⫻ 108 km for
short). Once you get used to it, this is more convenient than writing “150,000,000 kilometers” or “one hundred and fifty million
kilometers.” (The same number could also be written as 15 ⫻ 107
or 0.15 ⫻ 109, but the preferred form is always to have the first
figure be between 1 and 10.)

Calculators and Powers-of-Ten Notation
Most electronic calculators use a shorthand for powers-of-ten notation. To enter the number 1.5 ⫻ 108, you first enter 1.5, then
press a key labeled “EXP” or “EE,” then enter the exponent 8.
(The EXP or EE key takes care of the “⫻ 10” part of the expression.) The number will then appear on your calculator’s display
as “1.5 E 8,” “1.5 8,” or some variation of this; typically the
“⫻ 10” is not displayed as such. There are some variations from
one kind of calculator to another, so you should spend a few min-

utes reading over your calculator’s instruction manual to make
sure you know the correct procedure for working with numbers
in powers-of-ten notation. You will be using this notation continually in your study of astronomy, so this is time well spent.

You can use powers-of-ten notation for numbers that are less
than one by using a minus sign in front of the exponent. A negative exponent tells you to divide by the appropriate number of
tens. For example, 10⫺2 (“ten to the minus two”) means to divide by 10 twice, so 10⫺2 ⫽ 1/10 ⫻ 1/10 ⫽ 1/100 ⫽ 0.01. This
same idea tells us how to interpret other negative powers of ten:

Distance

to Sun

Powers-of-Ten Notation: Small Numbers

and so forth.
As these examples show, negative exponents tell you how
many tenths must be multiplied together to give the desired number. For example, one ten-thousandth, or 0.0001, can be written
as 10⫺4 (“ten to the minus four”) because 10⫺4 ⫽ 1/10 ⫻ 1/10 ⫻
1/10 ⫻ 1/10 ⫽ 0.0001.
A useful shortcut in converting a decimal to powers-of-ten
notation is to notice where the decimal point is. For example, the
decimal point in 0.0001 is four places to the left of the “1,” so
the exponent is ⫺4, that is, 0.0001 ⫽ 10⫺4.
You can also use powers-of-ten notation to express a number like 0.00245, which is not a multiple of 1/10. For example,
0.00245 ⫽ 2.45 ⫻ 0.001 ⫽ 2.45 ⫻ 10⫺3. (Again, the standard for
powers-of-ten notation is that the first figure is a number between
one and ten.) This notation is particularly useful when dealing with
very small numbers. A good example is the diameter of a hydrogen
atom, which is much more convenient to state in powers-of-ten
notation (1.1 ⫻ 10⫺10 meter, or 1.1 ⫻ 10⫺10 m) than as a decimal (0.00000000011 m) or a fraction (110 trillionths of a meter.)
Because it bypasses all the awkward zeros, powers-of-ten notation is ideal for describing the size of objects as small as atoms
or as big as galaxies (Figure 1-13). Box 1-2 explains how powersof-ten notation also makes it easy to multiply and divide numbers
that are very large or very small.

equal to 1.5 multiplied by itself 8 times, or 25.63, which is not

do this, perhaps you are thinking that you can multiply 1.5 by
10, then tack on the exponent later. This also does not work;
158 is equal to 15 multiplied by itself 8 times, or 2,562,890,625,
which again is nowhere near 1.5 ⫻ 108. Reading over the manual for your calculator will help you to avoid these common
errors.

Arithmetic with Powers-of-Ten Notation
Using powers-of-ten notation makes it easy to multiply numbers. For example, suppose you want to multiply 100 by 1000.
If you use ordinary notation, you have to write a lot of zeros:
100 ⫻ 1000 ⫽ 100,000 (one hundred thousand)
By converting these numbers to powers-of-ten notation,
we can write this same multiplication more compactly as

Because 2 ⫹ 3 ⫽ 5, we are led to the following general

Usually a computation involves numbers like 3.0 ⫻ 1010, that
is, an ordinary number multiplied by a factor of 10 with an
exponent. In such cases, to perform multiplication or
division, you can treat the numbers separately from the

In principle, we could express all sizes and distances in astronomy using units based on the meter. Indeed, we will use kilometers to give the diameters of the Earth and Moon, as well as
the Earth-Moon distance. But, while a kilometer (roughly equal
to three-fifths of a mile) is an easy distance for humans to visualize, a megameter (106 m) is not. For this reason, astronomers
have devised units of measure that are more appropriate for the
tremendous distances between the planets and the far greater distances between the stars.
When discussing distances across the solar system, astronomers use a unit of length called the astronomical unit (abbreviated AU). This is the average distance between Earth and
the Sun:

Units of Length, Time, and Mass
To understand and appreciate the universe, we need to describe phenomena not only on the large scales of galaxies but
also on the submicroscopic scale of the atom. Astronomers
generally use units that are best suited to the topic at hand. For
example, interstellar distances are conveniently expressed in either light-years or parsecs, whereas the diameters of the planets are more comfortably presented in kilometers.
Most scientists prefer to use a version of the metric system
called the International System of Units, abbreviated SI (after
the French name Système International). In SI units, length is
measured in meters (m), time is measured in seconds (s), and
mass (a measure of the amount of material in an object) is
measured in kilograms (kg). How are these basic units related
to other measures?
When discussing objects on a human scale, sizes and distances are usually expressed in millimeters (mm), centimeters
(cm), and kilometers (km). These units of length are related to
the meter as follows:
1 millimeter ⫽ 0.001 m ⫽ 10⫺3 m
1 centimeter ⫽ 0.01 m ⫽ 10⫺2 m
1 kilometer ⫽ 1000 m ⫽ 103 m
Although the English system of inches (in.), feet (ft), and
miles (mi) is much older than SI, today the English system is
actually based on the SI system: The inch is defined to be exactly 2.54 cm. A useful set of conversions is

EXAMPLE: The diameter of Mars is 6794 km. Let’s try
expressing this in miles.

CAUTION! You can get into trouble if you are careless in
applying the trick of taking the number whose units are to
be converted and multiplying it by 1. For example, if we
multiply the diameter by 1 expressed as (1.609 km)/(1 mi),
we get

6794 km ⫻ 1 ⫽ 6794 km

1.609 km
ᎏᎏ
1 mi

km2
10,930 ᎏ
mi

The unwanted units of km did not cancel, so this cannot be
right. Furthermore, a mile is larger than a kilometer, so the diameter expressed in miles should be a smaller number than
when expressed in kilometers.
The correct approach is to write the number 1 so that the
unwanted units will cancel. The number we are starting with
is in kilometers, so we must write the number 1 with kilometers in the denominator (“downstairs” in the fraction). Thus,
we express 1 as (1 mi)/(1.609 km):
6794 km ⫻ 1 ⫽ 6794 km ⫻ 1 mi/1.609 km
⫽ 4222 km ⫻ mi/km ⫽ 4222 mi

1 mi ⫽ 1.609 km

Now the units of km cancel as they should, and the distance
in miles is a smaller number than in kilometers (as it must be).
When discussing very small distances such as the size of
an atom, astronomers often use the micrometer (␮m) or the
nanometer (nm). These are related to the meter as follows:

Each of these equalities can also be written as a fraction
equal to 1. For example, you can write

1 micrometer ⫽ 1 ␮m ⫽ 10⫺6 m

1 in. ⫽ 2.54 cm
1 ft ⫽ 0.3048 m

0.3048 m
ᎏᎏ ⫽ 1
1 ft
Fractions like this are useful for converting a quantity
from one set of units to another. For example, the Saturn V
rocket used to send astronauts to the Moon stands about 363
feet tall. How can we convert this height to meters? The trick
is to remember that a quantity does not change if you multiply it by 1. Expressing the number 1 by the fraction (0.3048 m)/
(1 ft), we can write the height of the rocket as
363 ft ⫻ 1 ⫽ 363 ft

0.3048 m

1 ft

ft ⫻ m
111 ᎏ ⫽ 111 m

1 nanometer ⫽ 1 nm ⫽ 10⫺9 m
Thus, 1 ␮m ⫽ 103 nm. (Note that the micrometer is often
called the micron.)
The basic unit of time is the second (s). It is related to
other units of time as follows:
1 minute (min) ⫽ 60 s
1 hour (h) ⫽ 3600 s
1 day (d) ⫽ 86,400 s
1 year (y) ⫽ 3.156 ⫻ 107 s
(continued on the next page)

BOX 1-3 (continued)
In the SI system, speed is properly measured in meters per
second (m/s). Quite commonly, however, speed is also expressed in km/s and mi/h:
1 km/s ⫽ 103 m/s
1 km/s ⫽ 2237 mi/h
1 mi/h ⫽ 0.447 m/s
1 mi/h ⫽ 1.47 ft/s
In addition to using kilograms, astronomers sometimes express mass in grams (g) and in solar masses (M䉺), where the
subscript 䉺 is the symbol denoting the Sun. It is especially convenient to use solar masses when discussing the masses of stars
and galaxies. These units are related to each other as follows:

CAUTION! You may be wondering why we have not given
a conversion between kilograms and pounds. The reason is
that these units do not refer to the same physical quantity! A
kilogram is a unit of mass, which is a measure of the amount
of material in an object. By contrast, a pound is a unit of
weight, which tells you how strongly gravity pulls on that object’s material. Consider a person who weighs 110 pounds on
Earth, corresponding to a mass of 50 kg. Gravity is only
about one-sixth as strong on the Moon as it is on Earth, so
on the Moon this person would weigh only one-sixth of 110
pounds, or about 18 pounds. But that person’s mass of 50 kg
is the same on the Moon; wherever you go in the universe,
you take all of your material along with you. We will explore
the relationship between mass and weight in Chapter 4.

1 kg ⫽ 1000 g
1 M䉺 ⫽ 1.99 ⫻ 1030 kg

Thus, the average distance between the Sun and Jupiter can
be conveniently stated as 5.2 AU.

To talk about distances to the stars, astronomers use
two different units of length. The light-year (abbreviated ly) is the distance that light travels in one year.
This is a useful concept because the speed of light in empty space
always has the same value, 3.00 ⫻ 105 km/s (kilometers per second) or 1.86 ⫻ 105 mi/s (miles per second). In terms of kilometers or astronomical units, one light-year is given by

Earth’s orbit

1 ly ⫽ 9.46 ⫻ 1012 km ⫽ 63,240 AU
This distance is roughly equal to 6 trillion miles.

CAUTION! Keep in mind that despite its name, the light-year
is a unit of distance and not a unit of time. As an example, Proxima Centauri, the nearest star other than the Sun, is a distance
of 4.2 light-years from Earth. This means that light takes 4.2
years to travel to us from Proxima Centauri.
Physicists often measure interstellar distances in light-years
because the speed of light is one of nature’s most important numbers. But many astronomers prefer to use another unit of length,
the parsec, because its definition is closely related to a method of
measuring distances to the stars.
Imagine taking a journey far into space, beyond the orbits of
the outer planets. As you look back toward the Sun, Earth’s orbit subtends a smaller angle in the sky the farther you are from
the Sun. As Figure 1-14 shows, the distance at which 1 AU subtends an angle of 1 arcsec is defined as 1 parsec (abbreviated pc):
1 pc ⫽ 3.09 ⫻ 1013 km ⫽ 3.26 ly

Distance:
1 parsec
(3.26 light-years)

Angle:
1 arcsec" = 1

At a distance of 1 parsec,
a length of 1 AU subtends
an angle of 1 arcsec.

Observer

Figure 1-14
A Parsec The parsec, a unit of length commonly used by astronomers, is
equal to 3.26 light-years. The parsec is defined as the distance at which
1 AU perpendicular to the observer’s line of sight subtends an angle of
1 arcsec.

Astronomy and the Universe

The distance from Earth to Proxima Centauri can be stated
as 1.3 pc or as 4.2 ly. Whether you choose to use parsecs or lightyears is a matter of personal taste.
For even greater distances, astronomers commonly use kiloparsecs and megaparsecs (abbreviated kpc and Mpc). As we saw
before, these prefixes simply mean “thousand” and “million,”
respectively:

Cuba

1 kiloparsec ⫽ 1 kpc ⫽ 1000 pc ⫽ 103 pc
1 megaparsec ⫽ 1 Mpc ⫽ 1,000,000 pc ⫽

pc

For example, the distance from Earth to the center of our
Milky Way Galaxy is about 8 kpc, and the galaxy shown in Figure 1-9 is about 11 Mpc away.
Some astronomers prefer to talk about thousands or millions
of light-years rather than kiloparsecs and megaparsecs. Once again,
the choice is a matter of personal taste. As a general rule, astronomers use whatever yardsticks seem best suited for the issue at
hand and do not restrict themselves to one system of measurement.
For example, an astronomer might say that the supergiant star
Antares has a diameter of 860 million kilometers and is located
at a distance of 185 parsecs from Earth. The Cosmic Connections
figure on page 16 shows where these different systems are useful.

1-8 Astronomy is an adventure of the
human mind
An underlying theme of this book is that the universe is rational.
It is not a hodgepodge of unrelated things behaving in unpredictable ways. Rather, we find strong
Studying the universe
evidence that fundamental laws of
physics govern the nature of the unibenefits our lives on
verse and the behavior of everything
Earth
in it. These unifying concepts enable
us to explore realms far removed from our earthly experience.
Thus, a scientist can do experiments in a laboratory to determine
the properties of light or the behavior of atoms and then use this
knowledge to investigate the structure of the universe.
The discovery of fundamental laws of nature has had a profound influence on humanity. These laws have led to an immense
number of practical applications that have fundamentally transformed commerce, medicine, entertainment, transportation, and
other aspects of our lives. In particular, space technology has
given us instant contact with any point on the globe through communication satellites, precise navigation to any point on Earth using signals from the satellites of the Global Positioning System
(GPS), and accurate weather forecasts from meteorological satellites (Figure 1-15).
As important as the applications of science are, the pursuit
of scientific knowledge for its own sake is no less important. We
are fortunate to live in an age in which this pursuit is in full
flower. Just as explorers such as Columbus and Magellan discovered the true size of our planet in the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries, astronomers of the twenty-first century are exploring
the universe to an extent that is unparalleled in human history.
Indeed, even the voyages into space imagined by such great sci-

A Hurricane Seen from Space This image of Hurricane Frances was
made on September 2, 2004, by GOES-12 (Geostationary Operational
Environmental Satellite 12). A geostationary satellite like GOES-12 orbits
around Earth’s equator every 24 hours, the same length of time it takes
the planet to make a complete rotation. Hence, this satellite remains over
the same spot on Earth, from which it can monitor the weather
continuously. By tracking hurricanes from orbit, GOES-12 makes it much
easier for meteorologists to give early warning of these immense storms.
The resulting savings in lives and property more than pay for the cost of
the satellite. (NASA, NOAA)

ence fiction writers as Jules Verne and H. G. Wells pale in comparison to today’s reality. Over a few short decades, humans
have walked on the Moon, sent robot spacecraft to dig into the
Martian soil and explore the satellites of Saturn, and used the
most powerful telescopes ever built to probe the limits of the observable universe. Never before has so much been revealed in so
short a time.
As you proceed through this book, you will learn about the
tools that scientists use to explore the natural world, as well as
what they observe with these tools. But, most important, you will
see how astronomers build from their observations an understanding of the universe in which we live. It is this search for understanding that makes science more than merely a collection of
data and elevates it to one of the great adventures of the human
mind. It is an adventure that will continue as long as there are
mysteries in the universe—an adventure we hope you will come
to appreciate and share.

Key Ideas
Astronomy, Science, and the Nature of the Universe: The universe
is comprehensible. The scientific method is a procedure for formulating hypotheses about the universe. These are tested by observation or experimentation in order to build consistent models
or theories that accurately describe phenomena in nature.
• Observations of the heavens have helped scientists discover
some of the fundamental laws of physics. The laws of physics are
in turn used by astronomers to interpret their observations.
The Solar System: Exploration of the planets provides information about the origin and evolution of the solar system, as well as
about the history and resources of Earth.
Stars and Nebulae: Studying the stars and nebulae helps us learn
about the origin and history of the Sun and the solar system.
Galaxies: Observations of galaxies tell us about the origin and
history of the universe.
Angular Measure: Astronomers use angles to denote the positions
and sizes of objects in the sky. The size of an angle is measured
in degrees, arcminutes, and arcseconds.
Powers-of-Ten Notation is a convenient shorthand system for
writing numbers. It allows very large and very small numbers to
be expressed in a compact form.
Units of Distance: Astronomers use a variety of distance units.
These include the astronomical unit (the average distance from
Earth to the Sun), the light-year (the distance that light travels in
one year), and the parsec.

The small-angle formula, given in Box 1-1, relates the size of
an astronomical object to the angle it subtends. Box 1-3 illustrates how to convert from one unit of measure to another. An object traveling at speed v for a time t covers a

Why Astronomy?
by Sandra M. Faber
s you study astronomy, you may ask, “Why am I studying this subject? What good is it for people in general
and for me in particular?” Admittedly, astronomy does
not offer the same practical benefits as other sciences, so how
can it be important to your life?
On the most basic level, I think of astronomy as providing the ultimate background for human history. Recorded history goes back about 3000 years. For knowledge of the time
before that, we consult archeologists and anthropologists about
early human history and paleontologists, biologists, and geologists about the evolution of life and of our planet—altogether
going back some five billion years. Astronomy tells us about
the time before that, the ten billion years or so when the Sun,
solar system, and Milky Way Galaxy formed, and even about
the origin of the universe in the Big Bang. Knowledge of astronomy is part of a well-educated person’s view of history.
Astronomy challenges our belief system and impels us to
put our “philosophical house” in order. For example, the Bible
says the world and everything in it were created in six days by
the hand of God. However, according to the ancient Egyptians, the Earth arose spontaneously from the infinite waters
of the eternal universe, called Nun. Alaskan legends teach that
the world was created by the conscious imaginings of a deity
named Father Raven.
Modern astronomy, supported by physics and observations, differs from these stories of the creation of Earth. Astronomers believe that the Sun formed about five billion years
ago by gravitational collapse from a dense cloud of interstellar
gas and dust. At the same time, and over a period of several
hundred thousand years, the planets condensed within the
swirling solar nebula. Astronomers have actually seen young
stars form in this way.
At issue here, really, is the question of how we are to gain
information about the nature of the physical world—whether

Sandra M. Faber is professor of astronomy at the
University of California, Santa Cruz, and
astronomer at Lick Observatory. She chaired the
now legendary group of astronomers called the Seven
Samurai, who surveyed the nearest 400 elliptical galaxies and
discovered a new mass concentration, called the Great
Attractor. Dr. Faber received the Bok Prize from Harvard
University in 1978, was elected to the National Academy of
Sciences in 1985, and in 1986 won the coveted Dannie
Heineman Prize from the American Astronomical Society, in
recognition of her sustained body of especially influential
astronomical research.

by revelation and intuition or by logic and observation. Where
science stops and faith begins is a thorny issue for everyone,
but particularly for astronomers—and for astronomy students.
Astronomy cultivates our notions about cosmic time and
cosmic evolution. Given the short span of human life, it is all
too easy to overlook that the universe is a dynamic place. This
idea implies fragility—if something can change, it might even
some day disappear. For instance, in another five billion years
or so, the Sun will swell up and brighten to 1000 times its present luminosity, incinerating the Earth in the process. This is far
enough in the future that neither you nor I need to feel any
personal responsibility for preparing to meet this challenge.
However, other cosmic catastrophes will inevitably occur before then. The Earth will be hit by a sizable piece of space
debris—craters show that this happens every few million years
or so. Enormous volcanic eruptions have occurred in the past
and will certainly occur again. Another Ice Age is virtually certain to begin within the next 20,000 years, unless we first cook
the Earth ourselves by burning too much fossil fuel.
Such common notions as the inevitability of human
progress, the desirability of endless economic growth, and the
Earthís ability to support its human population are all based
on limited experience—they will probably not prove viable in
the long run. Consequently, we must rethink who we are as a
species and what is our proper activity on Earth. These longterm problems involve the whole human race and are vital to
our survival and well-being. Astronomy is essential to developing a perspective on human existence and its relation to the
cosmos.
Many astronomers believe that the ultimate, proper concept of “home” for the human race is our universe. It seems
increasingly likely that a large number of other universes exist,
with the vast majority incapable of harboring intelligent life as
we know it. The parallel with Earth is striking. Among the solar system planets, only Earth can support human life. Among
the great number of planets in our galaxy, only a small fraction may be such that we can call them home. The fraction of
hospitable universes is likely to be smaller still. It seems, then,
that our universe is the ultimate “home,” a sanctuary in a vast
sea of inhospitable universes.
I began this essay by talking about history and ended with
issues that border on the ethical and religious. Astronomy is
like that: It offers a modern-day version of Genesis—and of the
Apocalypse, too. I hope that during this course you will be able
to take time out to contemplate the broader implications of
what you are studying. This is one of the rare opportunities in
life to think about who you are and where you and the human
race are going. Don’t miss it.

t is a clear night at the Gemini North Observatory atop
Mauna Kea, a dormant volcano on the island of Hawaii. As
you gaze toward the north, as in this time-exposure photograph, you find that the stars are not motionless. Rather, they
move in counterclockwise circles around a fixed point above
the northern horizon. Stars close to this point never dip below
the horizon, while stars farther from the fixed point rise in the
east and set in the west. These motions fade from view when
the Sun rises in the east and illuminates the sky. The Sun, too,
arcs across the sky in the same manner as the stars. At day’s end,
when the Sun sets in the west, the panorama of stars is revealed
for yet another night.
These observations are at the heart of naked-eye astronomy—
the sort that requires no equipment but human vision. Naked-eye
astronomy cannot tell us what the Sun is made of or how far
away the stars are. For such purposes we need tools such as the
Gemini Telescope, housed within the dome shown in the photograph. But by studying naked-eye astronomy, you will learn the
answers to equally profound questions such as why there are seasons, why the night sky is different at different times of year, and
why the night sky looks different in Australia than in North
America. In discovering the answers to these questions, you will
learn how the Earth moves through space and will begin to understand our true place in the cosmos.

Positional astronomy—the study of the positions of objects in the sky and how these positions change—has
roots that extend far back in time. Four to five thousand years ago, the inhabitants of the British Isles erected stone
structures, such as Stonehenge, that suggest a preoccupation with
the motions of the sky. Alignments of these stones appear to show
where the Sun rose and set at key times during the year. Stone

Looking at the sky on a clear, dark night, you might
think that you can see millions of stars. Actually, the
unaided human eye can detect only about 6000 stars.
Because half of the sky is below the horizon at any one time, you
can see at most about 3000 stars. When ancient peoples looked
at these thousands of stars, they imagined that groupings of stars
traced out pictures in the sky. Astronomers still refer to these group- The constellations

myths and legends of antiquity. Although some star groupings
vaguely resemble the figures they are supposed to represent (see
Figure 2-2c), most do not.
The term “constellation” has a broader definition in presentday astronomy. On modern star charts, the entire sky is divided
into 88 regions, each of which is called a constellation. For example, the constellation Orion is now defined to be an irregular
patch of sky whose borders are shown in Figure 2-2b. When astronomers refer to the “Great Nebula” M42 in Orion, they mean

found in the grand tomb of Shih Huang Ti (259 B.C.–210 B.C.),
the first emperor of China.
Evidence of a highly sophisticated understanding of astronomy can be found in the written records of the Mayan civilization of central America. Mayan astronomers deduced by
observation that the apparent motions of the planet Venus follow
a cycle that repeats every 584 days. They also developed a technique for calculating the position of Venus on different dates. The
Maya believed that Venus was associated with war, so such calculations were important for choosing the most promising dates
on which to attack an enemy.
These archaeological discoveries bear witness to an awareness of naked-eye astronomy by the peoples of many cultures.
Many of the concepts of modern positional astronomy come to
us from these ancients, including the idea of dividing the sky into
constellations.

stars in Orion. The yellow lines show the borders between Orion and its

(Ursa Major being one of the biggest) and others very small areas (Crux, the Southern Cross, being the smallest). But because
the modern constellations cover the entire sky, every star lies in
one constellation or another.

CAUTION! When you look at a constellation’s star pattern, it
is tempting to conclude that you are seeing a group of stars that
are all relatively close together. In fact, most of these stars are
nowhere near one another. As an example, Figure 2-2b shows
the distances in light-years to four stars in Orion. Although Bellatrix (Arabic for “the Amazon”) and Mintaka (“the belt”) appear to be close to each other, Mintaka is actually more than
600 light-years farther away from us. The two stars only appear
to be close because they are in nearly the same direction as seen
from Earth. The same illusion often appears when you see an
airliner’s lights at night. It is very difficult to tell how far away
a single bright light is, which is why you can mistake an airliner
a few kilometers away for a star trillions of times more distant.

ER

The star names shown in Figure 2-2b are from the
Arabic. For example, Betelgeuse means “armpit,”
which makes sense when you look at the star atlas
drawing in Figure 2-2c. Other types of names are also used for
stars. For example, Betelgeuse is also known as ␣ Orionis because

CAUTION! A number of unscrupulous commercial firms offer
to name a star for you for a fee. The money that they charge
you for this “service” is real, but the star names are not; none
of these names are recognized by astronomers. If you want to
use astronomy to commemorate your name or the name of a
friend or relative, consider making a donation to your local
planetarium or science museum. The money will be put to much
better use!

will have risen above the eastern horizon, and some will have disappeared below the western horizon. If you look again before

and stars appear to move
If you repeat your observations in the sky
on the following night, you will find
that the motions of the sky are almost but not quite the same. The
same constellations rise in the east and set in the west, but a few
minutes earlier than on the previous night. If you look again after a month, the constellations visible at a given time of night
(say, midnight) will be noticeably different, and after six months
you will see an almost totally different set of constellations. Only
after a year has passed will the night sky have the same appearance as when you began.
Why does the sky go through diurnal motion? Why do the
constellations slowly shift from one night to the next? As we will
see, the answer to the first question is that the Earth rotates once
a day around an axis from the north pole to the south pole, while
the answer to the second question is that the Earth also revolves
once a year around the Sun.

Diurnal Motion and the Earth’s Rotation

Figure 2-3

RI V UXG

Day and Night on the Earth At any moment, half of the Earth is
illuminated by the Sun. As the Earth rotates from west to east, your
location moves from the dark (night) hemisphere into the illuminated
(day) hemisphere and back again. This image was recorded in 1992 by
the Galileo spacecraft as it was en route to Jupiter. (JPL/NASA)

Illuminated
(day) side

To understand diurnal motion, note that at any given moment it
is daytime on the half of the Earth illuminated by the Sun and
nighttime on the other half (Figure 2-3). The Earth rotates from
west to east, making one complete rotation every 24 hours, which
is why there is a daily cycle of day and night. Because of this rotation, stars appear to us to rise in the east and set in the west,
as do the Sun and Moon.
Figure 2-4 helps to further explain diurnal motion. It shows
two views of the Earth as seen from a point above the north pole.

8:00 P.M. and the constellation Cygnus (the Swan) is directly overhead. Four hours later, the constellation over California is Andromeda (named for a mythological princess). Because the Earth
rotates from west to east, it appears to us on Earth that the entire sky rotates around us in the opposite direction, from east to
west.

Andromeda

We described earlier that in addition to the diurnal motion of the
sky, the constellations visible in the night sky also change slowly
over the course of a year. This happens because the Earth orbits,
or revolves around, the Sun (Figure 2-5). Over the course of a
year, the Earth makes one complete orbit, and the darkened,
nighttime side of the Earth gradually turns toward different parts
of the heavens. For example, as seen from the northern hemisphere, at midnight in late July the constellation Cygnus is close
to overhead; at midnight in late September the constellation
Andromeda is close to overhead; and at midnight in late November the constellation Perseus (commemorating a mythological
hero) is close to overhead. If you follow a particular star on successive evenings, you will find that it rises approximately 4 minutes earlier each night, or 2 hours earlier each month.

Constellations can help you find your way around the sky. For
example, if you live in the northern hemisphere, you can use the
Big Dipper in Ursa Major to find the north direction by drawing
a straight line through the two stars at the front of the Big Dipper’s bowl (Figure 2-6). The first moderately bright star you come
to is Polaris, also called the North Star because it is located almost directly over the Earth’s north pole. If you draw a line from

Why the Night Sky Changes During the Year As the Earth orbits
around the Sun, the nighttime side of the Earth gradually turns toward
different parts of the sky. Hence, the particular stars that you see in the
night sky are different at different times of the year. This figure shows
which constellation is overhead at midnight local time—when the Sun is
on the opposite side of the Earth from your location—during different
months for observers at midnorthern latitudes (including the United
States). If you want to view the constellation Andromeda, the best time
of the year to do it is in late September, when Andromeda is nearly
overhead at midnight.

as the brightest stars in two other constellations. The chart shows the
sky at around 11 P.M. (daylight savings time) on August 1. Due to the
Earth’s orbital motion around the Sun, you will see this same view at
1 A.M. on July 1 and at 9 P.M. on September 1. The angular distance from
Polaris to Spica is 102°.

Polaris straight down to the horizon, you will find the north
direction.
As Figure 2-6 shows, by following the handle of the Big Dipper you can locate the bright reddish star Arcturus in Boötes (the
Shepherd) and the prominent bluish star Spica in Virgo (the Virgin). The saying “Follow the arc to Arcturus and speed to Spica”
may help you remember these stars, which are conspicuous in the
evening sky during the spring and summer.
During winter in the northern hemisphere, you can see some
of the brightest stars in the sky. Many of them are in the vicinity
of the “winter triangle” (Figure 2-7), which connects bright stars
in the constellations of Orion (the Hunter), Canis Major (the
Large Dog), and Canis Minor (the Small Dog).
A similar feature, the “summer triangle,” graces the summer
sky in the northern hemisphere. This triangle connects the brightest stars in Lyra (the Harp), Cygnus (the Swan), and Aquila (the
Eagle) (Figure 2-8). A conspicuous portion of the Milky Way
forms a beautiful background for these constellations, which are
nearly overhead during the middle of summer at midnight.

Many ancient societies believed that all the stars are the same distance from the Earth. They imagined the stars to be bits of fire
imbedded in the inner surface of an immense hollow sphere, called
the celestial sphere, with the Earth at its center. In this picture of
the universe, the Earth was fixed and did not rotate. Instead, the
entire celestial sphere rotated once a
day around the Earth from east to The concept of the
west, thereby causing the diurnal imaginary celestial
motion of the sky. The picture of a sphere helps us visualize

naked-eye observations, and for its
the sky
time was a useful model of how the

Knowing the Heavens

universe works. (We discussed the role of models in science in
Section 1-1).
Today’s astronomers know that this simple model of the universe is not correct. Diurnal motion is due to the rotation of the
Earth, not the rest of the universe. Furthermore, as we learned
when discussing the constellations in Section 2-2, the stars are not
all at the same distance from Earth. Indeed, the stars that you can
see with the naked eye range from 4.2 to more than 1000 lightyears away, and telescopes allow us to see objects at distances of
billions of light-years.
Thus, astronomers now recognize that the celestial sphere is
an imaginary object that has no basis in physical reality. Nonetheless, the celestial sphere model remains a useful tool of positional
astronomy. If we imagine, as did the ancients, that the Earth is
stationary and that the celestial sphere rotates around us, it is relatively easy to specify the directions to different objects in the sky
and to visualize the motions of these objects.
Figure 2-9 depicts the celestial sphere, with the Earth at its
center. (A truly proportional drawing would show the celestial
sphere as being millions of times larger than the Earth.) We picture the stars as points of light that are fixed on the inner surface
of the celestial sphere. If we project the Earth’s equator out into
space, we obtain the celestial equator. The celestial equator di-

27

vides the sky into northern and southern hemispheres, just as the
Earth’s equator divides the Earth into two hemispheres.
If we project the Earth’s north and south poles into space, we
obtain the north celestial pole and the south celestial pole. The
two celestial poles are where the Earth’s axis of rotation (extended out into space) intersects the celestial sphere (see Figure
2-9). The star Polaris is less than 1° away from the north celestial pole, which is why it is called the North Star or the Pole Star.
The point in the sky directly overhead an observer anywhere
on Earth is called that observer’s zenith. The zenith and celestial
sphere are shown in Figure 2-10 for an observer located at 35°
north latitude (that is, at a location on the Earth’s surface 35°
north of the equator). The zenith is shown at the top of Figure
2-10, so the Earth and the celestial sphere appear “tipped” compared to Figure 2-9. At any time, an observer can see only half of
the celestial sphere; the other half is below the horizon, hidden by
the body of the Earth. The hidden half of the celestial sphere is
darkly shaded in Figure 2-10.

The Celestial Sphere The celestial sphere is the apparent

of this (wholly imaginary) sphere. The Earth is at the center of the
celestial sphere, so our view is always of the inside of the sphere. The
celestial equator and poles are the projections of the Earth’s equator and
axis of rotation out into space. The celestial poles are therefore located
directly over the Earth’s poles.

north celestial pole during the course of the night, and are always above
the horizon on any night of the year. Stars within 35° of the south
celestial pole are always below the horizon and can never be seen from
this latitude. Stars that lie between these two extremes rise in the east
and set in the west.

The Apparent Motion of Stars at Different Latitudes
As the Earth rotates, stars appear to rotate around us along
paths that are parallel to the celestial equator. (a) As shown in this long
time exposure, at most locations on Earth the rising and setting motions

above the horizon. As the Earth turns from west to east, it appears to the observer that the celestial sphere turns from east to
west. Stars sufficiently near the north celestial pole revolve around
the pole, never rising or setting. Such stars are called circumpolar. For example, as seen from North America or Europe, Polaris
is a circumpolar star and can be seen at any time of night on any
night of the year. The photograph that opens this chapter shows
the circular trails of stars around the north celestial pole as seen
from Hawaii (at 20° north latitude). Stars near the south celestial
pole revolve around that pole but always remain below the horizon of an observer in the northern hemisphere. Hence, these stars
can never be seen by the observer in Figure 2-10. Stars between
those two limits rise in the east and set in the west.

CAUTION! Keep in mind that which stars are circumpolar,
which stars never rise, and which stars rise and set depends on
the latitude from which you view the heavens. As an example,
for an observer at 35° south latitude (roughly the latitude of
Sydney, Cape Town, and Buenos Aires), the roles of the north
and south celestial poles are the opposite of those shown in Figure 2-10: Objects close to the south celestial pole are circumpolar, that is, they revolve around that pole and never rise or set.
For an observer in the southern hemisphere, stars close to the
north celestial pole are always below the horizon and can never
be seen. Hence, astronomers in Australia, South Africa, and Argentina never see the North Star but are able to see other stars
that are forever hidden from North American or European
observers.
For observers at most locations on Earth, stars rise in the east
and set in the west at an angle to the horizon (Figure 2-11a). To
see why this is so, notice that the rotation of the celestial sphere
carries stars across the sky in paths that are parallel to the celestial equator. If you stand at the north pole, the north celestial pole
is directly above you at the zenith (see Figure 2-9) and the celestial equator lies all around you at the horizon. Hence, as the ce-

lestial sphere rotates, the stars appear to move parallel to the
horizon (Figure 2-11b). If instead you stand on the equator, the
celestial equator passes from the eastern horizon through the
zenith to the western horizon. The north and south celestial poles
are 90° away from the celestial equator, so they lie on the northern and southern horizons, respectively. As the celestial sphere rotates around an axis from pole to pole, the stars rise and set
straight up and down—that is, in a direction perpendicular to the
horizon (Figure 2-11c). At any location on Earth between the
equator and either pole, the rising and setting motions of the stars
are at an angle intermediate between Figures 2-11b and 2-11c.
The particular angle depends on the latitude.
Using the celestial equator and poles, we can define a coordinate system to specify the position of any star on the celestial
sphere. As Box 2-1 describes, the most commonly used coordinate system uses two angles, right ascension and declination, that
are analogous to longitude and latitude on Earth. These coordinates tell us in what direction we should look to see the star. To
locate the star’s true position in three-dimensional space, we must
also know the distance to the star.

Earth’s axis of rotation
In addition to rotating on its axis every 24 hours, the Earth revolves around the Sun—that is, it orbits the Sun—in about 3651⁄4
days (see Figure 2-5). As we travel with the Earth around its orbit, we experience the annual cycle
of seasons. But why are there seasons? Furthermore, the seasons are The celestial sphere

Figure 2-12
The Seasons The Earth’s axis of rotation is inclined 231⁄2° away from the
perpendicular to the plane of the Earth’s orbit. The north pole is aimed at
the north celestial pole, near the star Polaris. The Earth maintains this
orientation as it orbits the Sun. Consequently, the amount of solar

illumination and the number of daylight hours at any location on Earth
vary in a regular pattern throughout the year. This is the origin of the
seasons.

The Origin of the Seasons

During part of the year, when the Earth is in the part of its
orbit shown on the left side of Figure 2-12, the northern hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun. As the Earth spins on its axis, a
point in the northern hemisphere spends more than 12 hours in
the sunlight. Thus, the days there are long and the nights are short,
and it is summer in the northern hemisphere. The summer is hot
not only because of the extended daylight hours but also because
the Sun is high in the northern hemisphere’s sky. As a result, sunlight strikes the ground at a nearly perpendicular angle that heats
the ground efficiently (Figure 2-13a). During this same time of
year in the southern hemisphere, the days are short and the nights

The reason why we have seasons, and why they are different in
different hemispheres, is that the Earth’s axis of rotation is not
perpendicular to the plane of the Earth’s orbit. Instead, as Figure
2-12 shows, the axis is tilted about 231⁄2° away from the perpendicular. The Earth maintains this tilt as it orbits the Sun, with the
Earth’s north pole pointing toward the north celestial pole. (This
stability is a hallmark of all rotating objects. A top will not fall
over as long as it is spinning, and the rotating wheels of a motorcycle help to keep the rider upright.)

little heating of the ground takes place. This
accounts for the low temperatures in winter.

only about 3% over the course of a year. (The Earth’s orbit only

are long, because a point in this hemisphere spends fewer than
12 hours a day in the sunlight. The Sun is low in the sky, so sunlight strikes the surface at a grazing angle that causes little heating (Figure 2-13b), and it is winter in the southern hemisphere.
Half a year later, the Earth is in the part of its orbit shown
on the right side of Figure 2-12. Now the situation is reversed,
with winter in the northern hemisphere (which is now tilted away
from the Sun) and summer in the southern hemisphere. During
spring and autumn, the two hemispheres receive roughly equal
amounts of illumination from the Sun, and daytime and nighttime
are of roughly equal length everywhere on Earth.

longitude of your location denotes how far west or east you
are of an imaginary circle that runs from the north pole to the
south pole through the Royal Observatory in Greenwich, England. In an analogous way, astronomers use coordinates called
declination and right ascension to describe the position of a
planet, star, or galaxy on the celestial sphere.
Declination is analogous to latitude. As the illustration
shows, the declination of an object is its angular distance north
or south of the celestial equator, measured along a circle passing through both celestial poles. Like latitude, it is measured
in degrees, arcminutes, and arcseconds (see Section 1-5).
Right ascension is analogous to longitude. It is measured
from a line that runs between the north and south celestial
poles and passes through a point on the celestial equator called
the vernal equinox (shown as a blue dot in the illustration).
This point is one of two locations where the Sun crosses the
celestial equator during its apparent annual motion, as we discuss in Section 2-5. In the Earth’s northern hemisphere, spring
officially begins when the Sun reaches the vernal equinox in
late March. The right ascension of an object is the angular distance from the vernal equinox eastward along the celestial
equator to the circle used in measuring its declination (see illustration). Astronomers measure right ascension in time units
(hours, minutes, and seconds), corresponding to the time required for the celestial sphere to rotate through this angle. For

in July, but this small variation has little influence on the cycle
of the seasons. Also, if the seasons were really caused by variations in the Earth-Sun distance, the seasons would be the same
in both hemispheres!

How the Sun Moves on the Celestial Sphere
The plane of the Earth’s orbit around the Sun is called the ecliptic plane (Figure 2-14a). As a result of the Earth’s annual motion
around the Sun, it appears to us that the Sun slowly changes its
position on the celestial sphere over the course of a year. The circular path that the Sun appears to trace out against the background of stars is called the ecliptic (Figure 2-14b). The plane of
this path is the same as the ecliptic plane. (The name ecliptic suggests that the path traced out by the Sun has something to do with
eclipses. We will discuss the connection in Chapter 3.) Because
there are 3651⁄4 days in a year and 360° in a circle, the Sun appears to move along the ecliptic at a rate of about 1° per day.
This motion is from west to east, that is, in the direction opposite to the apparent motion of the celestial sphere.

(R.A. and Decl. are abbreviations for right ascenCISE

(or no sign at all) indicates that an object is north of the celestial equator. As we discuss in Box 2-2, right ascension helps
determine the best time to observe a particular object.
It is important to state the year for which a star’s right ascension and declination are valid. This is so because of precession, which we discuss in Section 2-6.

EXAMPLE: What are the coordinates of a star that lies exactly
halfway between the vernal equinox and the south celestial
pole?

Situation: Our goal is to find the right ascension and
declination of the star in question.

EXAMPLE: At midnight local time you see a star with R.A. ⫽

2h 30m 0s at your zenith. When will you see a star at your
zenith with R.A. ⫽ 21h 0m 0s?

Situation: If you held your finger stationary over a globe of
the Earth, the longitude of the point directly under your
finger would change as you rotated the globe. In the same
way, the right ascension of the point directly over your head
(the zenith) changes as the celestial sphere rotates. We use
this concept to determine the time in question.

Tools: We use the idea that a change in right ascension of
24h corresponds to an elapsed time of 24 hours and a
complete rotation of the celestial sphere.
Answer: The time required for the sky to rotate through the
angle between the stars is the difference in their right
ascensions: 21h 0m 0s – 2h 30m 0s ⫽ 18h 30m 0s. So the
second star will be at your zenith 181⁄2 hours after the first
one, or at 6:30 P.M. the following evening.

Tools: We use the definitions depicted in the figure.

Review: Our answer was based on the idea that the celestial

Answer: Since the circle used to measure this star’s

sphere makes exactly one complete rotation in 24 hours. If
this were so, from one night to the next each star would be
in exactly the same position at a given time. But because of
the way that we customarily measure time, the celestial
sphere makes slightly more than one complete rotation in
24 hours. (We explore the reasons for this in Box 2-2.) As a
result, our answer is in error by about 3 minutes. For our
purposes, this is a small enough error that we can ignore it.

declination passes through the vernal equinox, this star’s
right ascension is R.A. ⫽ 0h 0m 0s. The angle between the
celestial equator and south celestial pole is 90° 0⬘ 0⬙, so the
declination of this star is Decl. ⫽ –45° 0⬘ 0⬙.

Review: The declination in this example is negative because
the star is in the southern half of the celestial sphere.

ANALOGY Note that at the same time that the Sun is making
its yearlong trip around the ecliptic, the entire celestial sphere is
rotating around us once per day. You can envision the celestial
sphere as a merry-go-round rotating clockwise, and the Sun as
a restless child who is walking slowly around the merry-goround’s rim in the counterclockwise direction. During the time
it takes the child to make a round trip, the merry-go-round rotates 3651⁄4 times.
The ecliptic plane is not the same as the plane of the Earth’s
equator, thanks to the 231⁄2° tilt of the Earth’s rotation axis
shown in Figure 2-12. As a result, the ecliptic and the celestial
equator are inclined to each other by that same 231⁄2° angle
(Figure 2-15).

Equinoxes and Solstices
The ecliptic and the celestial equator intersect at only two points,
which are exactly opposite each other on the celestial sphere.
Each point is called an equinox (from the Latin for “equal night”),

31

because when the Sun appears at either of these points, day and
night are each about 12 hours long at all locations on Earth. The
term “equinox” is also used to refer to the date on which the Sun
passes through one of these special points on the ecliptic.
On about March 21 of each year, the Sun passes northward
across the celestial equator at the vernal equinox. This marks the
beginning of spring in the northern hemisphere (“vernal” is from
the Latin for “spring”). On about September 22 the Sun moves
southward across the celestial equator at the autumnal equinox,
marking the moment when fall begins in the northern hemisphere.
Since the seasons are opposite in the northern and southern hemispheres, for Australians and South Africans the vernal equinox
actually marks the beginning of autumn. The names of the
equinoxes come from astronomers of the past who lived north of
the equator.
Between the vernal and autumnal equinoxes lie two other significant locations along the ecliptic. The point on the ecliptic farthest north of the celestial equator is called the summer solstice.
“Solstice” is from the Latin for “solar standstill,” and it is at the
summer solstice that the Sun stops moving northward on the

The Ecliptic, Equinoxes, and Solstices This illustration of the celestial
sphere is similar to Figure 2-14b, but is drawn with the north celestial
pole at the top and the celestial equator running through the middle. The
ecliptic is inclined to the celestial equator by 231⁄2° because of the tilt of
the Earth’s axis of rotation. It intersects the celestial equator at two
points, called equinoxes. The northernmost point on the ecliptic is the
summer solstice, and the southernmost point is the winter solstice. The

so as seen by us the Sun takes a year to make a complete trip around the

celestial sphere. At this point, the Sun is as far north of the celestial equator as it can get. It marks the location of the Sun at the
moment summer begins in the northern hemisphere (about June
21). At the beginning of the northern hemisphere’s winter (about
December 21), the Sun is farthest south of the celestial equator at
a point called the winter solstice.
Because the Sun’s position on the celestial sphere varies slowly
over the course of a year, its daily path across the sky (due to the
Earth’s rotation) also varies with the seasons (Figure 2-16). On
the first day of spring or the first day of fall, when the Sun is at
one of the equinoxes, the Sun rises directly in the east and sets directly in the west.
When the northern hemisphere is tilted away from the Sun
and it is winter in the northern hemisphere, the Sun rises in the
southeast. Daylight lasts for fewer than 12 hours as the Sun skims
low over the southern horizon and sets in the southwest. Northern hemisphere nights are longest when the Sun is at the winter
solstice.
The closer you get to the north pole, the shorter the winter
days and the longer the winter nights. In fact, anywhere within
231⁄2° of the north pole (that is, north of latitude 90° – 231⁄2° ⫽
661⁄2° N) the Sun is below the horizon for 24 continuous hours
at least one day of the year. The circle around the Earth at 661⁄2°
north latitude is called the Arctic Circle (Figure 2-17). The corresponding region around the south pole is bounded by the Antarctic Circle at 661⁄2° south latitude. At the time of the winter solstice,
explorers south of the Antarctic Circle enjoy “the midnight sun,”
or 24 hours of continuous daylight.
During summer in the northern hemisphere, when the northern hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun, the Sun rises in the north-

The variations of the seasons are much less pronounced close
to the equator. Between the Tropic of Capricorn at 231⁄2° south
latitude and the Tropic of Cancer at 231⁄2° north latitude, the Sun
is directly overhead—that is, at the zenith—at high noon at least
one day a year. Outside of the tropics, the Sun is never directly
overhead, but is always either south of the zenith (as seen from
locations north of the Tropic of Cancer) or north of the zenith (as
seen from south of the Tropic of Capricorn).

Sun’s path (that is, the ecliptic). This is because the plane of the

month to the next, but always remains within a band called the
zodiac that extends about 8° on either side of the ecliptic. Twelve
famous constellations—Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo,
Virgo, Libra, Scorpius, Sagittarius, Capricornus, Aquarius, and
Pisces—lie along the zodiac. The Moon is generally found in one
of these 12 constellations. (Thanks to a redrawing of constellation boundaries in the mid-twentieth century, the zodiac actually
passes through a thirteenth constellation—Ophiuchus, the Serpent Bearer—between Scorpius and Sagittarius.) As it moves along
its orbit, the Moon appears north of the celestial equator for
about two weeks and then south of the celestial equator for about
the next two weeks. We will learn more about the Moon’s motion, as well as why the Moon goes through phases, in Chapter 3.
The Moon not only moves around the Earth but, in concert
with the Sun, also causes a slow change in the Earth’s rotation.
This is because both the Sun and the Moon exert a gravitational

pull on the Earth. We will learn much more about gravity in
Chapter 4; for now, all we need is the idea that gravity is a universal attraction of matter for other matter.
The gravitational pull of the Sun and the Moon affects the
Earth’s rotation because the Earth is slightly fatter across the
equator than it is from pole to pole: Its equatorial diameter is 43
kilometers (27 miles) larger than the diameter measured from
pole to pole. The Earth is therefore said to have an “equatorial
bulge.” Because of the gravitational pull of the Moon and the Sun
on this bulge, the orientation of the Earth’s axis of rotation gradually changes.
The Earth behaves somewhat like a spinning top, as illustrated in Figure 2-19. If the top were not spinning, gravity would
pull the top over on its side. When the top is spinning, gravity
causes the top’s axis of rotation to trace out a circle, producing a
motion called precession.

Precession Because the Earth’s rotation axis is tilted, the gravitational
pull of the Moon and the Sun on the Earth’s equatorial bulge together

cause the Earth to precess. As the Earth precesses, its axis of rotation
slowly traces out a circle in the sky, like the shifting axis of a spinning top.

Knowing the Heavens

As the Sun and Moon move along the zodiac, each spends
half its time north of the Earth’s equatorial bulge and half its time
south of it. The gravitational pull of the Sun and Moon tugging
on the equatorial bulge tries to twist the Earth’s axis of rotation
to be perpendicular to the plane of the ecliptic. But because the
Earth is spinning, the combined actions of gravity and rotation
cause the Earth’s axis to trace out a circle in the sky, much like
what happens to the toy top. As the axis precesses, it remains
tilted about 231⁄2° to the perpendicular.
As the Earth’s axis of rotation slowly changes its orientation,
the north and south celestial poles—which are the projections of
that axis onto the celestial sphere—change their positions relative
to the stars. At present, the north celestial pole lies within 1° of
the star Polaris, which is why Polaris is the North Star. But 5000
years ago, the north celestial pole was closest to the star Thuban
in the constellation of Draco (the Dragon). Thus, that star and
not Polaris was the North Star. And 12,000 years from now, the
North Star will be the bright star Vega in Lyra (the Harp). It takes
26,000 years for the north celestial pole to complete one full precessional circle around the sky (Figure 2-20). The south celestial
pole executes a similar circle in the southern sky.
Precession also causes the Earth’s equatorial plane to change
its orientation. Because this plane defines the location of the celestial equator in the sky, the celestial equator precesses as well.

The intersections of the celestial equator and the ecliptic define
the equinoxes (see Figure 2-15), so these key locations in the sky
also shift slowly from year to year. For this reason, the precession
of the Earth is also called the precession of the equinoxes. The
first person to detect the precession of the equinoxes, in the second century B.C., was the Greek astronomer Hipparchus, who
compared his own observations with those of Babylonian astronomers three centuries earlier. Today, the vernal equinox is located in the constellation Pisces (the Fishes). Two thousand years
ago, it was in Aries (the Ram). Around the year A.D. 2600, the
vernal equinox will move into Aquarius (the Water Bearer).

CAUTION! Astrological terms like the “Age of Aquarius” involve boundaries in the sky that are not recognized by astronomers and are generally not even related to the positions of
the constellations. For example, most astrologers would call a
person born on March 21, 1988, an “Aries” because the Sun
was supposedly in the direction of that constellation on March
21. But due to precession, the Sun was actually in the constellation Pisces on that date! Indeed, astrology is not a science at all,
but merely a collection of superstitions and hokum. Its practitioners use some of the terminology of astronomy but reject the
logical thinking that is at the heart of science. James Randi has
more to say about astrology and other pseudosciences in his essay “Why Astrology Is Not Science” at the end of this chapter.
The astronomer’s system of locating heavenly bodies by their
right ascension and declination, discussed in Box 2-1, is tied to
the positions of the celestial equator and the vernal equinox. Because of precession, these positions are changing, and thus the coordinates of stars in the sky are also constantly changing. These
changes are very small and gradual, but they add up over the
years. To cope with this difficulty, astronomers always make note
of the date (called the epoch) for which a particular set of coordinates is precisely correct. Consequently, star catalogs and star
charts are periodically updated. Most current catalogs and star
charts are prepared for the epoch 2000. The coordinates in these
reference books, which are precise for January 1, 2000, will require very little correction over the next few decades.

2-7 Positional astronomy plays an important
role in keeping track of time
Astronomers have traditionally been responsible for telling time.
This is because we want the system of timekeeping used in everyday life to reflect the position of the Sun in the sky. Thousands
of years ago, the sundial was invented to keep track of apparent
solar time. To obtain more accurate measurements astronomers
use the meridian. As Figure 2-21 shows, this is a north-south circle on the celestial sphere that passes through the zenith (the point
directly overhead) and both celestial
poles. Local noon is defined to be Ancient scholars

meridian, the half of the meridian below the horizon; this crossing cannot be observed directly.
The crossing of the meridian by any object in the sky is called
a meridian transit of that object. If the crossing occurs above the
horizon, it is an upper meridian transit. An apparent solar day is
the interval between two successive upper meridian transits of the
Sun as observed from any fixed spot on the Earth. Stated less formally, an apparent solar day is the time from one local noon to
the next local noon, or from when the Sun is highest in the sky
to when it is again highest in the sky.

The Meridian The meridian is a circle on the celestial sphere that passes
through the observer’s zenith (the point directly overhead) and the north
and south points on the observer’s horizon. The passing of celestial
objects across the meridian can be used to measure time. The upper
meridian is the part above the horizon, and the lower meridian (not
shown) is the part below the horizon.

Unfortunately, the Sun is not a good timekeeper (Figure 2-22).
The length of an apparent solar day (as measured by a device such
as an hourglass) varies from one time of year to another. There
are two main reasons why this is so, both having to do with the
way in which the Earth orbits the Sun.
The first reason is that the Earth’s orbit is not a perfect circle; rather, it is an ellipse, as Figure 2-22a shows in exaggerated
form. As we will learn in Chapter 4, the Earth moves more rapidly along its orbit when it is near the Sun than when it is farther
away. Hence, the Sun appears to us to move more than 1° per
day along the ecliptic in January, when the Earth is nearest the
Sun, and less than 1° per day in July, when the Earth is farthest
from the Sun. By itself, this effect would cause the apparent solar
day to be longer in January than in July.
The second reason why the Sun is not a good timekeeper is
the 231⁄2° angle between the ecliptic and the celestial equator (see

Figure 2-22
Why the Sun Is a Poor Timekeeper There are two main reasons that
the Sun is a poor timekeeper. (a) The Earth’s speed along its orbit varies
during the year. It moves fastest when closest to the Sun in January and
slowest when farthest from the Sun in July. Hence, the apparent speed of
the Sun along the ecliptic is not constant. (b) Because of the tilt of the

Earth’s rotation axis, the ecliptic is inclined with respect to the celestial
equator. Therefore, the projection of the Sun’s daily progress along the
ecliptic onto the celestial equator (shown in blue) varies during the year.
This causes further variations in the length of the apparent solar day.

Time Zones in North America For convenience, the Earth is divided

States, making for a 3-hour time difference between New York and

Figure 2-15). As Figure 2-22b shows, this causes a significant part
of the Sun’s apparent motion when near the equinoxes to be in a
north-south direction. The net daily eastward progress in the sky
is then somewhat foreshortened. At the summer and winter solstices, by contrast, the Sun’s motion is parallel to the celestial
equator. Thus, there is no comparable foreshortening around the
beginning of summer or winter. This effect by itself would make
the apparent solar day shorter in March and September than in
June or December. Combining these effects with those due to the
Earth’s noncircular orbit, we find that the length of the apparent
solar day varies in a complicated fashion over the course of a year.
To avoid these difficulties, astronomers invented an imaginary object called the mean sun that moves along the celestial
equator at a uniform rate. (In science and mathematics, “mean”
is a synonym for “average.”) The mean sun is sometimes slightly
ahead of the real Sun in the sky, sometimes behind. As a result,
mean solar time and apparent solar time can differ by as much as
a quarter of an hour at certain times of the year.
Because the mean sun moves at a constant rate, it serves as a
fine timekeeper. A mean solar day is the interval between successive upper meridian transits of the mean sun. It is exactly 24 hours
long, the average length of an apparent solar day. One 24-hour
day as measured by your alarm clock or wristwatch is a mean solar day.
Time zones were invented for convenience in commerce, transportation, and communication. In a time
zone, all clocks and watches are set to the mean solar

37

time for a meridian of longitude that runs approximately through
the center of the zone. Time zones around the world are generally centered on meridians of longitude at 15° intervals. In most
cases, going from one time zone to the next requires you to change
the time on your wristwatch by exactly 1 hour. The time zones
for most of North America are shown in Figure 2-23.
In order to coordinate their observations with colleagues elsewhere around the globe, astronomers often keep track of time
using Coordinated Universal Time, somewhat confusingly abbreviated UTC or UT. This is the time in a zone that includes Greenwich, England, a seaport just outside of London where the first
internationally accepted time standard was kept. (UTC was formerly known as Greenwich Mean Time.) In North America, Eastern Standard Time (EST) is 5 hours different from UTC;
9:00 A.M. EST is 14:00 UTC. Coordinated Universal Time is also
used by aviators and sailors, who regularly travel from one time
zone to another.
Although it is natural to want our clocks and method of
timekeeping to be related to the Sun, astronomers often use a system that is based on the apparent motion of the stars. This system, called sidereal time, is useful when aiming a telescope. Most
observatories are therefore equipped with a clock that measures
sidereal time, as discussed in Box 2-2.

2-8 Astronomical observations led to the
development of the modern calendar
Just as the day is a natural unit of time based on the Earth’s rotation, the year is a natural unit of time based on the Earth’s revolution about the Sun. However, nature has not arranged things
for our convenience. The year does
not divide into exactly 365 whole Our calendar is complex
days. Ancient astronomers realized
because a year does not
that the length of a year is approxi1
mately 365 ⁄4 days, so the Roman contain a whole number
emperor Julius Caesar established of days
the system of “leap years” to account
for this extra quarter of a day. By adding an extra day to the calendar every four years, he hoped to ensure that seasonal astronomical events, such as the beginning of spring, would occur on
the same date year after year.
Caesar’s system would have been perfect if the year were exactly 3651⁄4 days long and if there were no precession. Unfortunately, this is not the case. To be more accurate, astronomers now
use several different types of years. For example, the sidereal year
is defined to be the time required for the Sun to return to the same
position with respect to the stars. It is equal to 365.2564 mean
solar days, or 365d 6h 9m 10s.
The sidereal year is the orbital period of the Earth around the
Sun, but it is not the year on which we base our calendar. Like
Caesar, most people want annual events—in particular, the first
days of the seasons—to fall on the same date each year. For example, we want the first day of spring to occur on March 21. But
spring begins when the Sun is at the vernal equinox, and the vernal equinox moves slowly against the background stars because
of precession. Therefore, to set up a calendar we use the tropical

38

BOX 2-2

Tools of the Astronomer’s Trade

Sidereal Time
you want to observe a particular object in the heavens, the
time to do so is when the object is high in the sky, on
Iorfideal
close to the upper meridian. This minimizes the distorting
effects of the Earth’s atmosphere, which increase as you view
closer to the horizon. For astronomers who study the Sun, this
means making observations at local noon, which is not too different from noon as determined using mean solar time. For astronomers who observe planets, stars, or galaxies, however,
the optimum time to observe depends on the particular object
to be studied. The problem is this: Given the location of a
given object on the celestial sphere, when will that object be
on the upper meridian?
To answer this question, astronomers use sidereal time
rather than solar time. It is different from the time on your
wristwatch. In fact, a sidereal clock and an ordinary clock even
tick at different rates, because they are based on different astronomical objects. Ordinary clocks are related to the position
of the Sun, while sidereal clocks are based on the position of
the vernal equinox, the location from which right ascension is
measured. (See Box 2-1 for a discussion of right ascension.)
Regardless of where the Sun is, midnight sidereal time at
your location is defined to be when the vernal equinox crosses
your upper meridian. (Like solar time, sidereal time depends
on where you are on Earth.) A sidereal day is the time between
two successive upper meridian passages of the vernal equinox.
By contrast, an apparent solar day is the time between two successive upper meridian crossings of the Sun. The illustration
shows why these two kinds of day are not equal. Because the
Earth orbits the Sun, the Earth must make one complete rotation plus about 1° to get from one local solar noon to the next.
This extra 1° of rotation corresponds to 4 minutes of time,

(a) A month’s motion of the Earth along its orbit

which is the amount by which a solar day exceeds a sidereal
day. To be precise:
1 sidereal day ⫽ 23h 56m 4.091s
where the hours, minutes, and seconds are in mean solar time.
One day according to your wristwatch is one mean solar
day, which is exactly 24 hours of solar time long. A sidereal
clock measures sidereal time in terms of sidereal hours, minutes, and seconds, where one sidereal day is divided into 24
sidereal hours.
This explains why a sidereal clock ticks at a slightly different rate than your wristwatch. As a result, at some times of
the year a sidereal clock will show a very different time than
an ordinary clock. (At local noon on March 21, when the Sun
is at the vernal equinox, a sidereal clock will say that it is midnight. Do you see why?)
We can now answer the question in the opening paragraph. The vernal equinox, whose celestial coordinates are
R.A. ⫽ 0h 0m 0s, Decl. ⫽ 0° 0⬘ 0⬙, crosses the upper meridian
at midnight sidereal time (0:00). The autumnal equinox, which
is on the opposite side of the celestial sphere at R.A. ⫽ 12h 0m
0s, Decl. ⫽ 0° 0⬘ 0⬙, crosses the upper meridian 12 sidereal
hours later at noon sidereal time (12:00). As these examples illustrate, any object crosses the upper meridian when the sidereal time is equal to the object’s right ascension. That is why
astronomers measure right ascension in units of time rather
than degrees, and why right ascension is always given in sidereal hours, minutes, and seconds.

EXAMPLE: Suppose you want to observe the bright star Spica
(Figure 2-6), which has epoch 2000 coordinates R.A. ⫽ 13h
25m 11.6s, Decl. ⫽ –11° 9⬘ 41⬙. What is the best time to do
this?

Situation: Our goal is to find the time when Spica passes
through your upper meridian, where it can best be
observed.

Tools: We use the idea that a celestial object is on your
upper meridian when the sidereal time equals the object’s
right ascension.
Answer: Based on the given right ascension of Spica, it will
be best placed for observation when the sidereal time at your
location is about 13:25. (Note that sidereal time is measured
using a 24-hour clock.)
Review: By itself, our answer doesn’t tell you what time on
your wristwatch (which measures mean solar time) is best for
observing Spica. That’s why most observatories are equipped
with a sidereal clock.
While sidereal time is extremely useful in astronomy, mean
solar time is still the best method of timekeeping for most
earthbound purposes. All time measurements in this book are
expressed in mean solar time unless otherwise stated.

Knowing the Heavens

year, which is equal to the time needed for the Sun to return to
the vernal equinox. This period is equal to 365.2422 mean solar
days, or 365d 5h 48m 46s. Because of precession, the tropical year
is 20 minutes and 24 seconds shorter than the sidereal year.
Caesar’s assumption that the tropical year equals 3651⁄4 days
was off by 11 minutes and 14 seconds. This tiny error adds up to
about three days every four centuries. Although Caesar’s astronomical advisers were aware of the discrepancy, they felt that it
was too small to matter. However, by the sixteenth century the
first day of spring was occurring on March 11.
The Roman Catholic Church became concerned because
Easter kept shifting to progressively earlier dates. To straighten
things out, Pope Gregory XIII instituted a calendar reform in
1582. He began by dropping ten days (October 4, 1582, was followed by October 15, 1582), which brought the first day of spring
back to March 21. Next, he modified Caesar’s system of leap
years.
Caesar had added February 29 to every calendar year that is
evenly divisible by four. Thus, for example, 2004, 2008, and
2012 are all leap years with 366 days. But we have seen that this
system produces an error of about three days every four centuries.
To solve the problem, Pope Gregory decreed that only the century years evenly divisible by 400 should be leap years. For example, the years 1700, 1800, and 1900 (which would have been
leap years according to Caesar) were not leap years in the improved Gregorian system, but the year 2000, which can be divided evenly by 400, was a leap year.
We use the Gregorian system today. It assumes that the
year is 365.2425 mean solar days long, which is very close to
the true length of the tropical year. In fact, the error is only one
day in every 3300 years. That won’t cause any problems for a
long time.

Key Ideas
Ideas preceded by an asterisk (*) are discussed in the Boxes.
Constellations and the Celestial Sphere: It is convenient to imagine
the stars fixed to the celestial sphere with the Earth at its center.
• The surface of the celestial sphere is divided into 88 regions
called constellations.
Diurnal (Daily) Motion of the Celestial Sphere: The celestial
sphere appears to rotate around the Earth once in each 24-hour
period. In fact, it is actually the Earth that is rotating.
• The poles and equator of the celestial sphere are determined by
extending the axis of rotation and the equatorial plane of the
Earth out to the celestial sphere.
• *The positions of objects on the celestial sphere are described
by specifying their right ascension (in time units) and declination
(in angular measure).
Seasons and the Tilt of the Earth’s Axis: The Earth’s axis of rotation is tilted at an angle of about 231⁄2° from the perpendicular
to the plane of the Earth’s orbit.
• The seasons are caused by the tilt of the Earth’s axis.
• Over the course of a year, the Sun appears to move around the
celestial sphere along a path called the ecliptic. The ecliptic is inclined to the celestial equator by about 231⁄2°.
• The ecliptic crosses the celestial equator at two points in the
sky, the vernal and autumnal equinoxes. The northernmost point
that the Sun reaches on the celestial sphere is the summer solstice,
and the southernmost point is the winter solstice.
Precession: The orientation of the Earth’s axis of rotation changes
slowly, a phenomenon called precession.
• Precession is caused by the gravitational pull of the Sun and
Moon on the Earth’s equatorial bulge.

• Precession of the Earth’s axis causes the positions of the
equinoxes and celestial poles to shift slowly.
• *Because the system of right ascension and declination is tied
to the position of the vernal equinox, the date (or epoch) of observation must be specified when giving the position of an object
in the sky.
Timekeeping: Astronomers use several different means of keeping
time.
• Apparent solar time is based on the apparent motion of the Sun
across the celestial sphere, which varies over the course of the
year.
• Mean solar time is based on the motion of an imaginary mean
sun along the celestial equator, which produces a uniform mean
solar day of 24 hours. Ordinary watches and clocks measure
mean solar time.
• *Sidereal time is based on the apparent motion of the celestial
sphere.
The Calendar: The tropical year is the period between two passages of the Sun across the vernal equinox. Leap year corrections
are needed because the tropical year is not exactly 365 days. The
sidereal year is the actual orbital period of the Earth.

One of the best ways to understand the sky and its
motions is to use the Starry Night Enthusiast™
computer program on the CD-ROM that accompanies certain printed copies of this book. This easy-to-use
program allows you to view the sky on any date and at any
time, as seen from any point on Earth, and to animate the
sky to visualize its diurnal and annual motions.
You may also find it useful to examine a planisphere, a
device consisting of two rotatable disks. The bottom disk
shows all the stars in the sky (for a particular latitude), and
the top one is opaque with a transparent oval window through
which only some of the stars can be seen. By rotating the top
disk, you can immediately see which constellations are above
the horizon at any time of the year. A planisphere is a convenient tool to carry with you when you are out observing
the night sky.

Why Astrology Is Not Science
by James Randi
’m involved in the strange business of telling folks what
they should already know. I meet audiences who believe in
all sorts of impossible things, often despite their education
and intelligence. My job is to explain how science differs from
the unproven, illogical assumptions of pseudoscience—and
why it matters. Perhaps my best example is the difference between astronomy and astrology.
Both astrology and astronomy arose from the wonders of
the night sky, from the stars to comets, planets, the Sun, and
the Moon. Surely, humans have long reasoned, there must be
some meaning in their motions. Surely the Moon’s effect on
tides hints at hidden “causes” for strange events. Judiciary (literally “judging”) astrology therefore attempted to foretell the
future—our earthly future. To serve it, horary (literally
“hourly”) astrology carefully tracked the heavens.
It is the latter that has become astronomy. Thanks to its
process of careful measurement and testing, we now understand more about the true nature of the starry universe than
astrologers could ever have imagined. With the birth of a new
science, astronomers had a logical framework based on physical causes and systematic observations.
Astrology remains a popular delusion. Far too many believe today that patterns in the sky govern our lives. They accept the vague tendencies and portents of seers who cast
horoscopes. They shouldn’t. Just a glance at the tenets of astrology provides ample evidence of its absurdity.
An individual is said to be born under a sign. To the astrologer, the Sun was located “in” that sign at the moment of

I

James (“the Amazing”) Randi works tirelessly to
expose trickery so that others can relish the greater
wonder of science. As a magician, he has had his own
television show and an enormous public following. As a lecturer, he
addresses teachers, students, and others worldwide. His
newsletter and column for The Skeptic are key resources for
educators. His many books include Flim-Flam!, The Faith Healers,
and The Mask of Nostradamus, about a legendary con man with
secrets of his own.
Mr. Randi helped found the Committee for the Scientific
Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal, and his $10,000 prize
for “the performance of any paranormal event . . . under proper
observing conditions” has gone unclaimed for more than 25 years.

birth. (Stars are not seen in the daytime, but no matter—a calculation tells where the Sun is.) Each sign takes its name from
a constellation, a totally imaginary figure invented for our convenience in referring to stars. Different cultures have different
mythical figures up there, and so different schools of astrology
assign different meanings to the signs they use.
In the spirit of equal-opportunity swindling, astrologers
divide up the year fairly, ignoring variations in the size of
constellations. Since Libra is tiny, while Virgo is huge, they
chop some of the sky off Virgo and add it—along with bits of
Scorpio—to bring Libra up to size. The Sun could well be declared “in” Libra when it is actually outside that constellation.
It gets worse. Science constantly challenges itself and
changes. The rules of astrology could not, although they were
made up thousands of years ago, and since then the “fixed”
stars have moved. In particular, precession of the equinoxes
has shifted objects in the sky relative to our calendar. The constellations have changed but astrology has not. If you were
born August 7, you are said to be a Leo, but the Sun that day
was really in the same part of the sky as the constellation
Cancer.
With a theory like this to back it up, we should not be surprised at the bottom line: A pseudoscience does not work. Test
after test has checked its predictions, and the result is always
the same. One such investigator is Shawn Carlson of the University of California, San Diego. As he put it in Nature magazine, astrology is “a hopeless cause.” Johannes Kepler, the
pioneering astronomer, himself cast horoscopes, but they are
little remembered today. Owen Gingerich, a historian of science at Harvard, puts it well: Kepler was the astrologer who
destroyed astrology.
Astronomy works, and it works very well indeed. That
isn’t easy. Because we humans tend to find what we want in
any body of data, it takes science’s careful process of observation, creative insight, and critical thinking to understand and
predict changes in nature. As I write, a transit of Ganymede is
due next Thursday at 21:47:20. At exactly that time, the satellite of Jupiter will cross in front of its planet as seen from
Earth, and yet most of us will never know it. Still other moons
of Jupiter may hold fresh clues to the formation of our entire
solar system and the conditions for life elsewhere.
For most people, astronomy has too little fantasy or money
in it, and they will never experience the beauty in its predictions. The dedicated labors of generations of scientists have enabled us to perform a genuine wonder.

Eclipses and
the Motion
of the Moon

n March 29, 2006, a rare cosmic spectacle—a total solar
eclipse—was visible along a narrow corridor that extended
from the coast of Brazil through equatorial Africa and into
central Asia. As shown in this digital composite taken in Turkey,
the Moon slowly moved over the disk of the Sun. (Time flows
from left to right in this image.) For a few brief minutes the Sun
was totally covered, darkening the sky and revealing the Sun’s
thin outer atmosphere, or corona, which glows with an unearthly
pearlescent light.
Such eclipses can be seen only on specific dates from special
locations on Earth, so not everyone will ever see the Moon cover
the Sun in this way. But anyone can find the Moon in the sky and
observe how its appearance changes from night to night, from
new moon to full moon and back again, and how the times when
the Moon rises and sets differ noticeably from one night to the
next.
In this chapter our subject is how the Moon moves as seen
from the Earth. We will explore why the Moon goes through a
regular cycle of phases, and how the Moon’s orbit around the
Earth leads to solar eclipses as well as lunar eclipses. We will also
see how ancient astronomers used their observations of the Moon
to determine the size and shape of the Earth, as well as other features of the solar system. Thus, the Moon—which has always
loomed large in the minds of poets, lovers, and dreamers—has
also played a key role in the development of our modern picture
of the universe.

Understanding the Moon’s Phases
Figure 3-1 shows both the Moon and the Earth as seen from a
spacecraft. When this image was recorded, the Sun was far off to
the right. Hence, only the right-hand hemispheres of both worlds
were illuminated by the Sun; the left-hand hemispheres were in
darkness and are not visible in the picture. In the same way, when
we view the Moon from the Earth, we see only the half of the
Moon that faces the Sun and is illuminated. However, not all of
the illuminated half of the Moon is necessarily facing us. As the
Moon moves around the Earth, from one night to the next we see
different amounts of the illuminated half of the Moon. These different appearances of the Moon are called lunar phases.

Moon orbit around the Earth. We now know that only the Moon
orbits the Earth, while the Earth-Moon system as a whole (Figure
3-1) orbits the Sun. (In Chapter 4 we will learn how this was
discovered.)
One key difference between the Sun and the Moon is the nature of the light that we receive from them. The Sun emits its own
light. So do the stars, which are objects like the Sun but much farther away, and so does an ordinary light bulb. By contrast, the
light that we see from the Moon is reflected light. This is sunlight
that has struck the Moon’s surface, bounced off, and ended up in
our eyes here on Earth.

CAUTION! You probably associate reflection with shiny objects like a mirror or the surface of a still lake. In science, however, the term refers to light bouncing off any object. You see
most objects around you by reflected light. When you look at
your hand, for example, you are seeing light from the Sun (or
from a light fixture) that has been reflected from the skin of
your hand and into your eye. In the same way, moonlight is
really sunlight that has been reflected by the Moon’s surface.

Figure 3-2 shows the relationship between the lunar
phase visible from Earth and the position of the Moon
ER
in its orbit. For example, when the Moon is at position
CISE 3
A, we see it in roughly the same direction in the sky as the Sun.
Hence, the dark hemisphere of the Moon faces the Earth. This
phase, in which the Moon is barely visible, is called new moon.
Since a new moon is near the Sun in the sky, it rises around sunrise and sets around sunset.
As the Moon continues around its orbit from position A in
Figure 3-2, more of its illuminated half becomes exposed to our
view. The result, shown at position B, is a phase called waxing
crescent moon (“waxing” is a synonym for “increasing”). About
a week after new moon, the Moon is at position C; we then see
half of the Moon’s illuminated hemisphere and half of the dark
hemisphere. This phase is called first quarter moon.
As seen from Earth, a first quarter moon is one-quarter of the
way around the celestial sphere from the Sun. It rises and sets
about one-quarter of an Earth rotation, or six hours, after the Sun
does: moonrise occurs around noon, and moonset occurs around
midnight.

CAUTION! Despite the name, a first quarter moon appears to
be half illuminated, not one-quarter illuminated! The name
means that this phase is one-quarter of the way through the
complete cycle of lunar phases.
About four days later, the Moon reaches position D in Figure 3-2. Still more of the illuminated hemisphere can now be seen
from Earth, giving us the phase called waxing gibbous moon
(“gibbous” is another word for “swollen”). When you look at the
Moon in this phase, as in the waxing crescent and first quarter
phases, the illuminated part of the Moon is toward the west. Two
weeks after new moon, when the Moon stands opposite the Sun
in the sky (position E), we see the fully illuminated hemisphere.
This phase is called full moon. Because a full moon is opposite the
Sun on the celestial sphere, it rises at sunset and sets at sunrise.
Over the following two weeks, we see less and less of the
Moon’s illuminated hemisphere as it continues along its orbit,
and the Moon is said to be waning (“decreasing”). While the
Moon is waning, its illuminated side is toward the east. The
phases are called waning gibbous moon (position F), third quarter moon (position G, also called last quarter moon), and waning
crescent moon (position H). A third quarter moon appears onequarter of the way around the celestial sphere from the Sun, but
on the opposite side of the celestial sphere from a first quarter
moon. Hence, a third quarter moon rises and sets about one-

Figure 3-2
Why the Moon Goes Through Phases This figure shows

the Moon at eight positions on its orbit, along with
photographs of what the Moon looks like at each position as seen from
Earth. The changes in phase occur because light from the Sun illuminates

quarter Earth rotation, or 6 hours, before the Sun: moonrise is
around midnight and moonset is around noon.
The Moon takes about four weeks to complete one orbit
around the Earth, so it likewise takes about four weeks for a complete cycle of phases from new moon to full moon and back to
new moon. Since the Moon’s position relative to the Sun on the
celestial sphere is constantly changing, and since our system of
timekeeping is based on the Sun (see Section 2-7), the times of
moonrise and moonset are different on different nights. On average the Moon rises and sets about an hour later each night.
Figure 3-2 also explains why the Moon is often visible in
the daytime, as shown in Figure 3-3. From any location on
Earth, about half of the Moon’s orbit is visible at any time. For
example, if it is midnight at your location, you are in the middle of the dark side of the Earth that faces away from the Sun.
At that time you can easily see the Moon if it is at position C,
D, E, F, or G. If it is midday at your location, you are in the

one half of the Moon, and as the Moon orbits the Earth we see varying
amounts of the Moon’s illuminated half. It takes about 291⁄2 days for the
Moon to go through a complete cycle of phases. (Photographs from Yerkes
Observatory and Lick Observatory)

middle of the Earth’s illuminated side, and the Moon will be
easily visible if it is at position A, B, C, G, or H. (The Moon is
so bright that it can be seen even against the bright blue sky.)
You can see that the Moon is prominent in the midnight sky for
about half of its orbit, and prominent in the midday sky for the
other half.

CAUTION! A very common misconception about lunar phases
is that they are caused by the shadow of the Earth falling on the
Moon. As Figure 3-2 shows, this is not the case at all. Instead,
phases are simply the result of our seeing the illuminated half of
the Moon at different angles as the Moon moves around its orbit. To help you better visualize how this works, Box 3-1 describes how you can simulate the cycle shown in Figure 3-2
using ordinary objects on Earth. (As we will learn in Section
3-3, the Earth’s shadow does indeed fall on the Moon on rare
occasions. When this happens, we see a lunar eclipse.)

BOX 3-1

The Heavens on the Earth

Phases and Shadows
igure 3-2 shows how the relative positions of the Earth,
Moon, and Sun explain the phases of the Moon. You can
visualize lunar phases more clearly by doing a simple experiment here on Earth. All you need are a small round object,
such as an orange or a baseball, and a bright source of light,
such as a street lamp or the Sun.
In this experiment, you play the role of an observer on the
Earth looking at the Moon, and the round object plays the role
of the Moon. The light source plays the role of the Sun. Hold
the object in your right hand with your right arm stretched
straight out in front of you, with the object directly between
you and the light source (position A in the accompanying illustration). In this orientation the illuminated half of the object faces away from you, like the Moon when it is in its new
phase (position A in Figure 3-2).
Now, slowly turn your body to the left so that the object
in your hand “orbits” around you (toward positions C, E, and
G in the illustration). As you turn, more and more of the illuminated side of the “moon” in your hand becomes visible, and
it goes through the same cycle of phases—waxing crescent,
first quarter, and waxing gibbous—as does the real Moon.
When you have rotated through half a turn so that the light

F

ht

Object’s “orbit”
C

source is directly behind you, you will be looking face on at
the illuminated side of the object in your hand. This corresponds to a full moon (position E in Figure 3-2). Make sure
your body does not cast a shadow on the “moon” in your
hand—that would correspond to a lunar eclipse!
As you continue turning to the left, more of the unilluminated half of the object becomes visible as its phase moves
through waning gibbous, third quarter, and waning crescent.
When your body has rotated back to the same orientation that
you were in originally, the unilluminated half of your handheld “moon” is again facing toward you, and its phase is again
new. If you continue to rotate, the object in your hand repeats
the cycle of “phases,” just as the Moon does as it orbits around
the Earth.
The experiment works best when there is just one light
source around. If there are several light sources, such as in a
room with several lamps turned on, the different sources will
create multiple shadows and it will be difficult to see the phases
of your hand-held “moon.” If you do the experiment outdoors
using sunlight, you may find that it is best to perform it in the
early morning or late afternoon when shadows are most pronounced and the Sun’s rays are nearly horizontal.

think that it is because the Moon does not rotate (unlike the
Earth, which rotates around an axis that passes from its north
pole to its south pole). To see that this cannot be the case, consider Figure 3-4. This figure shows the Earth and the orbiting
Moon from a vantage point far above the Earth’s north pole. In
this figure two craters on the lunar surface have been colored, one
in red and one in blue. If the Moon did not rotate on its axis, as
in Figure 3-4a, at some times the red crater would be visible from
Earth, while at other times the blue crater would be visible. Thus,
we would see different parts of the lunar surface over time, which
does not happen in reality.

49

In fact, the Moon always keeps the same face toward us because it is rotating, but in a very special way: It takes exactly as
long to rotate on its axis as it does to make one orbit around
the Earth. This situation is called synchronous rotation. As Figure 3-4b shows, this keeps the crater shown in red always facing
the Earth, so that we always see the same face of the Moon. In
Chapter 4 we will learn why the Moon’s rotation and orbital motion are in step with each other.
An astronaut standing at the spot shown in red in Figure
3-4b would spend two weeks (half of a lunar orbit) in darkness,
or lunar nighttime, and the next two weeks in sunlight, or lunar
daytime. Thus, as seen from the Moon, the Sun rises and sets, and
no part of the Moon is perpetually in darkness. This means that
there really is no “dark side of the Moon.” The side of the Moon
that constantly faces away from the Earth is properly called the
far side. The Sun rises and sets on the far side just as on the side
toward the Earth. Hence, the blue crater on the far side of the
Moon in Figure 3-4b is in sunlight for half of each lunar orbit.

Sidereal and Synodic Months
The time for a complete lunar “day”—the same as the time that
it takes the Moon to rotate once on its axis—is about four weeks.
(Because the Moon’s rotation is synchronous, it takes the same
time for one complete lunar orbit.) It also takes about four weeks
for the Moon to complete one cycle of its phases as seen from
Earth. This regular cycle of phases inspired our ancestors to invent the concept of a month. For historical reasons, none of which

The Sidereal and Synodic Months The

sidereal month is the time the Moon takes to
complete one full revolution around the Earth with respect
to the background stars. However, because the Earth is
constantly moving along its orbit about the Sun, the Moon
must travel through slightly more than 360° of its orbit to
get from one new moon to the next. Thus, the synodic
month—the time from one new moon to the next—is
longer than the sidereal month.

has much to do with the heavens, the calendar we use today has
months of differing lengths. Astronomers find it useful to define
two other types of months, depending on whether the Moon’s
motion is measured relative to the stars or to the Sun. Neither
corresponds exactly to the familiar months of the calendar.
The sidereal month is the time it takes the Moon to complete
one full orbit of the Earth, as measured with respect to the stars.
This true orbital period is equal to about 27.32 days. The synodic
month, or lunar month, is the time it takes the Moon to complete
one cycle of phases (that is, from new moon to new moon or from
full moon to full moon) and thus is measured with respect to the
Sun rather than the stars. The length of the “day” on the Moon
is a synodic month, not a sidereal month.
The synodic month is longer than the sidereal month because
the Earth is orbiting the Sun while the Moon goes through its
phases. As Figure 3-5 shows, the Moon must travel more than
360° along its orbit to complete a cycle of phases (for example,
from one new moon to the next). Because of this extra distance,
the synodic month is equal to about 29.53 days, about two days
longer than the sidereal month.
Both the sidereal month and synodic month vary somewhat
from one orbit to another, the latter by as much as half a day.
The reason is that the Sun’s gravity sometimes causes the Moon
to speed up or slow down slightly in its orbit, depending on the
relative positions of the Sun, Moon, and Earth. Furthermore, the
Moon’s orbit changes slightly from one month to the next.

astronomical events that can be seen
with the naked eye.
A lunar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes through the
Earth’s shadow. This occurs when the Sun, Earth, and Moon are
in a straight line, with the Earth between the Sun and Moon so
that the Moon is at full phase (position E in Figure 3-2). At this
point in the Moon’s orbit, the face of the Moon seen from Earth
would normally be fully illuminated by the Sun. Instead, it appears quite dim because the Earth casts a shadow on the Moon.
A solar eclipse occurs when the Earth passes through the Moon’s
shadow. As seen from Earth, the Moon moves in front of the Sun.
Once again, this can happen only when the Sun, Moon, and Earth
are in a straight line. However, for a solar eclipse to occur, the
Moon must be between the Earth and the Sun. Therefore, a solar
eclipse can occur only at new moon (position A in Figure 3-2).

CAUTION! Both new moon and full moon occur at intervals of

291⁄2 days. Hence, you might expect that there would be a solar eclipse every 291⁄2 days, followed by a lunar eclipse about
two weeks (half a lunar orbit) later. But in fact, there are only
a few solar eclipses and lunar eclipses per year. Solar and lunar
eclipses are so infrequent because the plane of the Moon’s orbit
and the plane of the Earth’s orbit are not exactly aligned, as Figure 3-6 shows. The angle between the plane of the Earth’s orbit and the plane of the Moon’s orbit is about 5°. Because of
this tilt, new moon and full moon usually occur when the Moon
is either above or below the plane of the Earth’s orbit. When the
Moon is not in the plane of the Earth’s orbit, the Sun, Moon,
and Earth cannot align perfectly, and an eclipse cannot occur.

Eclipses and the Motion of the Moon

Plane of Earth’s orbit
( = plane of the ecliptic)

In order for the Sun, Earth, and Moon to be lined up for an
eclipse, the Moon must lie in the same plane as the Earth’s orbit
around the Sun. As we saw in Section 2-5, this plane is called the
ecliptic plane because it is the same as the plane of the Sun’s apparent path around the sky, or ecliptic (see Figure 2-14). Thus,
when an eclipse occurs, the Moon appears from Earth to be on
the ecliptic—which is how the ecliptic gets its name.
The planes of the Earth’s orbit and the Moon’s orbit intersect along a line called the line of nodes, shown in Figure 3-6. The
line of nodes passes through the Earth and is pointed in a particular direction in space. Eclipses can occur only if the line of nodes
is pointed toward the Sun—that is, if the Sun lies on or near the
line of nodes—and if, at the same time, the Moon lies on or very
near the line of nodes. Only then do the Sun, Earth, and Moon
lie in a line straight enough for an eclipse to occur (Figure 3-7).

Anyone who wants to predict eclipses must know the
orientation of the line of nodes. But the line of nodes
is gradually shifting because of the gravitational pull
of the Sun on the Moon. As a result, the line of nodes rotates
slowly westward. Astronomers calculate such details to fix the
dates and times of upcoming eclipses.

Three Types of Lunar Eclipse People on

the nighttime side of the Earth see a lunar
eclipse when the Moon moves through the Earth’s
shadow. In the umbra, the darkest part of the shadow,
the Sun is completely covered by the Earth. The
penumbra is less dark because only part of the Sun is
covered by the Earth. The three paths show the motion
of the Moon if the lunar eclipse is penumbral (Path 1, in
yellow), total (Path 2, in red), or partial (Path 3, in blue).
The inset shows these same paths, along with the
umbra and penumbra, as viewed from the Earth.

There are at least two—but never more than five—solar
eclipses each year. The last year in which five solar eclipses occurred was 1935. The least number of eclipses possible (two solar, zero lunar) happened in 1969. Lunar eclipses occur just about
as frequently as solar eclipses, but the maximum possible number
of eclipses (lunar and solar combined) in a single year is seven.

On average, two or three lunar eclipses occur in a year.

Of all lunar eclipses, roughly one-third are total, onethird are partial, and one-third are penumbral.

The character of a lunar eclipse depends on exactly how the
Moon travels through the Earth’s shadow. As Figure 3-8 shows,
the shadow of the Earth has two distinct parts. In the umbra, the dark- A lunar eclipse is most

but can also be partial or
portion of the Sun’s surface is visible
in the penumbra, which therefore is penumbral
not quite as dark. Most people notice a lunar eclipse only if the Moon passes into the Earth’s umbra. As this umbral phase of the eclipse begins, a bite seems to be
taken out of the Moon.
The inset in Figure 3-8 shows the different ways in which the
Moon can pass into the Earth’s shadow. When the Moon passes
through only the Earth’s penumbra (Path 1), we see a penumbral
eclipse. During a penumbral eclipse, the Earth blocks only part of
the Sun’s light and so none of the lunar surface is completely
shaded. Because the Moon still looks full but only a little dimmer
than usual, penumbral eclipses are easy to miss. If the Moon travels completely into the umbra (Path 2), a total lunar eclipse occurs. If only part of the Moon passes through the umbra (Path 3),
we see a partial lunar eclipse.
If you were on the Moon during a total lunar eclipse, the Sun
would be hidden behind the Earth. But some sunlight would be
visible through the thin ring of atmosphere around the Earth, just
as you can see sunlight through a person’s hair if they stand with
their head between your eyes and the Sun. As a result, a small

amount of light reaches the Moon during a total lunar eclipse,
and so the Moon does not completely disappear from the sky as
seen from Earth. Most of the sunlight that passes through the
Earth’s atmosphere is red, and thus the eclipsed Moon glows
faintly in reddish hues, as Figure 3-9 shows. (We’ll see in Chapter 5 how our atmosphere causes this reddish color.)
Lunar eclipses occur at full moon, when the Moon is directly
opposite the Sun in the sky. Hence, a lunar eclipse can be seen at
any place on Earth where the Sun is below the horizon (that is,
where it is nighttime). A lunar eclipse has the maximum possible
duration if the Moon travels directly through the center of the
umbra. The Moon’s speed through the Earth’s shadow is roughly
1 kilometer per second (3600 kilometers per hour, or 2280 miles
per hour), which means that totality—the period when the Moon
is completely within the Earth’s umbra—can last for as long as 1
hour and 42 minutes.

As seen from Earth, the angular diameter of the Moon is almost
exactly the same as the angular diameter of the far larger but

A Total Lunar Eclipse This sequence of nine photographs was taken
over a 3-hour period during the lunar eclipse of January 20, 2000. The
sequence, which runs from right to left, shows the Moon moving through

flowers close their petals, and crickets begin to chirp as if evening
had arrived. As the last few rays of sunlight peek out from behind
the edge of the Moon and the eclipse becomes total, the landscape
around you is bathed in an eerie gray or, less frequently, in shimmering bands of light and dark. Finally, for a few minutes the
Moon completely blocks out the dazzling solar disk and not much
else (Figure 3-10a). The solar corona—the Sun’s thin, hot outer
atmosphere, which is normally too dim to be seen—blazes forth
in the darkened daytime sky (Figure 3-10b). It is an awe-inspiring sight.

CAUTION! If you are fortunate enough to see a solar eclipse,
keep in mind that the only time when it is safe to look at the

Sun is during totality, when the solar disk is blocked by the
Moon and only the solar corona is visible. Viewing this magnificent spectacle cannot harm you in any way. But you must never
look directly at the Sun when even a portion of its intensely brilliant disk is exposed. If you look directly at the Sun at any time
without a special filter approved for solar viewing, you will suffer permanent eye damage or blindness.
To see the remarkable spectacle of a total solar eclipse, you
must be inside the darkest part of the Moon’s shadow, also called
the umbra, where the Moon completely blocks the Sun. Because
the Sun and the Moon have nearly the same angular diameter as
seen from Earth, only the tip of the Moon’s umbra reaches the

Earth’s surface (Figure 3-11). As the Earth rotates, the tip of the
umbra traces an eclipse path across the Earth’s surface. Only
those locations within the eclipse path are treated to the spectacle of a total solar eclipse. The inset in Figure 3-11 shows the dark
spot on the Earth’s surface produced by the Moon’s umbra.

Partial Solar Eclipses
Immediately surrounding the Moon’s umbra is the region of partial shadow called the penumbra. As seen from this area, the Sun’s
surface appears only partially covered by the Moon. During a solar eclipse, the Moon’s penumbra covers a large portion of the
Earth’s surface, and anyone standing inside the penumbra sees a
partial solar eclipse. Such eclipses are much less interesting events
than total solar eclipses, which is why astronomy enthusiasts
strive to be inside the eclipse path. If you are within the eclipse
path, you will see a partial eclipse before and after the brief period of totality (see the photograph that opens this chapter).
The width of the eclipse path depends primarily on the EarthMoon distance during totality. The eclipse path is widest if the
Moon happens to be at perigee, the point in its orbit nearest the
Earth. In this case the width of the eclipse path can be as great as
270 kilometers (170 miles). In most eclipses, however, the path is
much narrower.

Annular Solar Eclipses
In some eclipses the Moon’s umbra does not reach all the way to
the Earth’s surface. This can happen if the Moon is at or near
apogee, its farthest position from Earth. In this case, the Moon
appears too small to cover the Sun completely. The result is a
third type of solar eclipse, called an annular eclipse. During an
annular eclipse, a thin ring of the Sun is seen around the edge of
the Moon (Figure 3-12). The length of the Moon’s umbra is
nearly 5000 kilometers (3100 miles) less than the average distance
between the Moon and the Earth’s surface. Thus, the Moon’s
shadow often fails to reach the Earth even when the Sun, Moon,
and Earth are properly aligned for an eclipse. Hence, annular
eclipses are slightly more common—as well as far less dramatic—
than total eclipses.
Even during a total eclipse, most people along the eclipse
path observe totality for only a few moments. The Earth’s rotation, coupled with the orbital motion of the Moon, causes the
umbra to race eastward along the eclipse path at speeds in excess
of 1700 kilometers per hour (1060 miles per hour). Because of
the umbra’s high speed, totality never lasts for more than 71⁄2
minutes. In a typical total solar eclipse, the Sun-Moon-Earth
alignment and the Earth-Moon distance are such that totality
lasts much less than this maximum.

The Geometry of a Total Solar Eclipse During a total solar
eclipse, the tip of the Moon’s umbra reaches the Earth’s
surface. As the Earth and Moon move along their orbits, this tip traces an
eclipse path across the Earth’s surface. People within the eclipse path see
a total solar eclipse as the tip moves over them. Anyone within the
penumbra sees only a partial eclipse. The inset photograph was taken
from the Mir space station during the August 11, 1999, total solar eclipse
(the same eclipse shown in Figure 3-10). The tip of the umbra appears as
a black spot on the Earth’s surface. At the time the photograph was
taken, this spot was 105 km (65 mi) wide and was crossing the English
Channel at 3000 km/h (1900 mi/h). (Photograph by Jean-Pierre Haigneré,

The details of solar eclipses are calculated well in advance. They are published in such reference books as
the Astronomical Almanac and are available on the
World Wide Web. Figure 3-13 shows the eclipse paths for all total solar eclipses from 1997 to 2020. Table 3-2 lists all the total,
annular, and partial eclipses from 2007 to 2011, including the
maximum duration of totality for total eclipses.
Ancient astronomers achieved a limited ability to predict
eclipses. In those times, religious and political leaders who were
able to predict such awe-inspiring events as eclipses must have
made a tremendous impression on their followers. One of three
priceless manuscripts to survive the devastating Spanish Conquest
shows that the Mayan astronomers of Mexico and Guatemala
had a fairly reliable method for predicting eclipses. The great
Greek astronomer Thales of Miletus is said to have predicted the
famous eclipse of 585 B.C., which occurred during the middle of

a war. The sight was so unnerving that the soldiers put down
their arms and declared peace.
In retrospect, it seems that what ancient astronomers actually
produced were eclipse “warnings” of various degrees of reliability rather than true predictions. Working with historical records,
these astronomers generally sought to discover cycles and regularities from which future eclipses could be anticipated. Box 3-2 describes how you might produce eclipse warnings yourself.

of the Earth and attempted to determine

The prediction of eclipses was not the only problem attacked by
ancient astronomers. More than 2000 years ago, centuries before
sailors of Columbus’s era crossed the oceans, Greek astronomers
were fully aware that the Earth is not flat. They had come to
this conclusion using a combination of observation and logical

Predicting Solar Eclipses
uppose that you observe a solar eclipse in your hometown and want to figure out when you and your neighbors might see another eclipse. How would you begin?
First, remember that a solar eclipse can occur only if the
line of nodes points toward the Sun at the same time that there
is a new moon (see Figure 3-7). Second, you must know that
it takes 29.53 days (one synodic month) to go from one new
moon to the next. Because solar eclipses occur only during new
moon, you must wait several whole lunar months for the
proper alignment to occur again.
However, there is a complication: The line of nodes gradually shifts its position with respect to the background stars. It
takes 346.6 days to move from one alignment of the line of
nodes pointing toward the Sun to the next identical alignment.
This period is called the eclipse year.
Therefore, to predict when you will see another solar
eclipse, you need to know how many whole lunar months
equal some whole number of eclipse years. This will tell you
how long you will have to wait for the next virtually identical
alignment of the Sun, the Moon, and the line of nodes. By trial
and error, you find that 223 lunar months is the same length
of time as 19 eclipse years, because

S

day, the Earth will have rotated by an extra 120° (one-third of
a complete rotation) when the next solar eclipse of a particular series occurs. The eclipse path will thus be one-third of the
way around the world from you. Therefore, you must wait
three full saros intervals (54 years, 34 days) before the eclipse
path comes back around to your part of the Earth. The illustration shows a series of six solar eclipse paths, each separated
from the next by one saros interval.
There is evidence that ancient Babylonian astronomers
knew about the saros interval. However, the discovery of the
saros is more likely to have come from lunar eclipses than solar eclipses. If you are far from the eclipse path, there is a good
chance that you could fail to notice a solar eclipse. Even if half
the Sun is covered by the Moon, the remaining solar surface
provides enough sunlight for the outdoor illumination not to
be greatly diminished. By contrast, anyone on the nighttime
side of the Earth can see an eclipse of the Moon unless clouds
block the view.

Unfortunately, no one today is sure of the exact length of the

the zenith (see Section 2-4) as seen from Syene. Eratosthenes knew
that the Sun never appeared at the zenith at his home in the Egyptian city of Alexandria, which is on the Mediterranean Sea almost
due north of Syene. Rather, on the summer solstice in Alexandria,
the position of the Sun at local noon was about 7° south of the
zenith (Figure 3-14). This angle is about one-fiftieth of a complete
circle, so he concluded that the distance from Alexandria to Syene
must be about one-fiftieth of the Earth’s circumference.
In Eratosthenes’s day, the distance from Alexandria to Syene
was said to be 5000 stades. Therefore, Eratosthenes found the
Earth’s circumference to be

This calculation is accurate to within a few hours. A more
accurate calculation gives an interval, called the saros, that is
about one-third day longer, or 6585.3 days (18 years, 11.3
days). Eclipses separated by the saros interval are said to form
an eclipse series.
You might think that you and your neighbors would simply have to wait one full saros interval to go from one solar
eclipse to the next. However, because of the extra one-third

Aristarchus and Distances in the Solar System
Eratosthenes was only one of several brilliant astronomers to
emerge from the so-called Alexandrian school, which by his time
had a distinguished tradition. One of the first Alexandrian astronomers, Aristarchus of Samos, had proposed a method of determining the relative distances to the Sun and Moon, perhaps as
long ago as 280 B.C.
Aristarchus knew that the Sun, Moon, and Earth form a right
triangle at the moment of first or third quarter moon, with the
right angle at the location of the Moon (Figure 3-15). He estimated that, as seen from Earth, the angle between the Moon and
the Sun at first and third quarters is 87°, or 3° less than a right
angle. Using the rules of geometry, Aristarchus concluded that the
Sun is about 20 times farther from us than is the Moon. We now
know that Aristarchus erred in measuring angles and that the

Eratosthenes’s Method of Determining the Diameter of the Earth
Around 200 B.C., Eratosthenes used observations of the Sun’s position at
noon on the summer solstice to show that Alexandria and Syene were
about 7° apart on the surface of the Earth. This angle is about one-fiftieth
of a circle, so the distance between Alexandria and Syene must be about
one-fiftieth of the Earth’s circumference.

average distance to the Sun is about 390 times larger than the average distance to the Moon. It is nevertheless impressive that people were trying to measure distances across the solar system more
than 2000 years ago.

Aristarchus measured the angle
between the Sun and the
first or third quarter moon.

Aristarchus also made an equally bold attempt to determine
the relative sizes of the Earth, Moon, and Sun. From his observations of how long the Moon takes to move through the Earth’s
shadow during a lunar eclipse, Aristarchus estimated the diame-

Using these measurements and geometry,
Aristarchus calculated the ratio of the Earth-Sun
distance and the Earth-Moon distance.

Aristarchus’s Method of Determining Distances to the Sun and
Moon Aristarchus knew that the Sun, Moon, and Earth form a right
triangle at first and third quarter phases. Using geometrical arguments,

he calculated the relative lengths of the sides of these triangles, thereby
obtaining the distances to the Sun and Moon.

ter of the Earth to be about 3 times larger than the diameter of
the Moon. To determine the diameter of the Sun, Aristarchus simply pointed out that the Sun and the Moon have the same angular size in the sky. Therefore, their diameters must be in the same
proportion as their distances (see part a of the figure in Box 1-1).
In other words, because Aristarchus thought the Sun to be 20
times farther from the Earth than the Moon, he concluded that
the Sun must be 20 times larger than the Moon. Once Eratosthenes had measured the Earth’s circumference, astronomers of
the Alexandrian school could estimate the diameters of the Sun
and Moon as well as their distances from Earth.
Table 3-3 summarizes some ancient and modern measurements of the sizes of Earth, the Moon, and the Sun and the distances between them. Some of these ancient measurements are far
from the modern values. Yet the achievements of our ancestors
still stand as impressive applications of observation and reasoning and important steps toward the development of the scientific
method.

Key Ideas
Lunar Phases: The phases of the Moon occur because light from
the Moon is actually reflected sunlight. As the relative positions
of the Earth, the Moon, and the Sun change, we see more or less
of the illuminated half of the Moon.

• With respect to the stars, the Moon completes one orbit around
the Earth in a sidereal month, averaging 27.32 days.
• The Moon completes one cycle of phases (one orbit around the
Earth with respect to the Sun) in a synodic month, averaging
29.53 days.
The Moon’s Orbit: The plane of the Moon’s orbit is tilted by
about 5° from the plane of the Earth’s orbit, or ecliptic.
• The line of nodes is the line where the planes of the Moon’s orbit and the Earth’s orbit intersect. The gravitational pull of the
Sun gradually shifts the orientation of the line of nodes with respect to the stars.
Conditions for Eclipses: During a lunar eclipse, the Moon passes
through the Earth’s shadow. During a solar eclipse, the Earth
passes through the Moon’s shadow.
• Lunar eclipses occur at full moon, while solar eclipses occur at
new moon.
• Either type of eclipse can occur only when the Sun and Moon
are both on or very near the line of nodes. If this condition is not
met, the Earth’s shadow cannot fall on the Moon and the Moon’s
shadow cannot fall on the Earth.
Umbra and Penumbra: The shadow of an object has two parts:
the umbra, within which the light source is completely blocked,
and the penumbra, where the light source is only partially blocked.
Lunar Eclipses: Depending on the relative positions of the Sun,
Moon, and Earth, lunar eclipses may be total (the Moon passes
completely into the Earth’s umbra), partial (only part of the Moon
passes into the Earth’s umbra), or penumbral (the Moon passes
only into the Earth’s penumbra).
Solar Eclipses: Solar eclipses may be total, partial, or annular.
• During a total solar eclipse, the Moon’s umbra traces out an
eclipse path over the Earth’s surface as the Earth rotates. Observers outside the eclipse path but within the penumbra see only
a partial solar eclipse.
• During an annular eclipse, the umbra falls short of the Earth,
and the outer edge of the Sun’s disk is visible around the Moon
at mideclipse.
The Moon and Ancient Astronomers: Ancient astronomers such as
Aristarchus and Eratosthenes made great progress in determining
the sizes and relative distances of the Earth, the Moon, and the Sun.

Advanced Questions
Problem-solving tips and tools
To estimate the average angular speed of the Moon along its
orbit (that is, how many degrees around its orbit the Moon
travels per day), divide 360° by the length of a sidereal month.
It is helpful to know that the saros interval of 6585.3 days
equals 18 years and 111⁄3 days if the interval includes 4 leap
years, but is 18 years and 101⁄3 days if it includes 5 leap years.
25. The dividing line between the illuminated and unilluminated
halves of the Moon is called the terminator. The terminator
appears curved when there is a crescent or gibbous moon, but
appears straight when there is a first quarter or third quarter
moon (see Figure 3-2). Describe how you could use these
facts to explain to a friend why lunar phases cannot be caused
by the Earth’s shadow falling on the Moon.

During an occultation, or “covering up,” of Jupiter by the
Moon, an astronomer notices that it takes the Moon’s edge

motion is assumed to be uniform and the occultation was
“central” (that is, center over center), find the angular diameter of Jupiter. (Hint: Assume that Jupiter does not appear to
move against the background of stars during this brief 90second interval. You will need to convert the Moon’s angular speed from degrees per day to arcseconds per second.)
The plane of the Moon’s orbit is inclined at a 5° angle from
the ecliptic, and the ecliptic is inclined at a 231⁄2° angle from

How many more sidereal months than synodic months are
there in a year? Explain.
Suppose the Earth moved a little faster around the Sun, so
that it took a bit less than one year to make a complete orbit. If the speed of the Moon’s orbit around the Earth were
unchanged, would the length of the sidereal month be the
same, longer, or shorter than it is now? What about the synodic month? Explain your answers.
If the Moon revolved about the Earth in the same orbit but
in the opposite direction, would the synodic month be longer
or shorter than the sidereal month? Explain your reasoning.
One definition of a “blue moon” is the second full moon
within the same calendar month. There is usually only one
full moon within a calendar month, so the phrase “once in a

rare? Are there any months of the year in which it would be
impossible to have two full moons? Explain your answer.
You are watching a lunar eclipse from some place on the

During a total solar eclipse, the Moon’s umbra moves in a

Archaeoastronomy and Ethnoastronomy
by Mark Hollabaugh
any years ago I read astronomer John Eddy’s National
Geographic article about the Wyoming Medicine
Wheel. A few years later I visited this archaeological
site in the Bighorn Mountains and started on the major preoccupation of my career.
Archaeoastronomy combines astronomy and archaeology.
You may be familiar with sites such as Stonehenge or the
Mayan ruins of the Yucatán. You may not know that there are
many archaeological sites in the United States that demonstrate
the remarkable understanding a people, usually known as the
Anasazi, had about celestial motions (see Figure 2-1). Chaco
Canyon, Hovenweep, and Chimney Rock in the Four Corners
area of the Southwest preserve ruins from this ancient Pueblo
culture.
Moonrise at Chimney Rock in southern Colorado provides a good example of the Anasazi’s knowledge of the lunar
cycles. If you watched the rising of the Moon for many, many
years, you would discover that the Moon’s northernmost rising point undergoes an 18.6-year cycle. Dr. McKim Malville
of the University of Colorado discovered that the Anasazi who
lived there knew of the lunar standstill cycle and watched the
northernmost rising of the Moon between the twin rock pillars
of Chimney Rock.
My own specialty is the ethnoastronomy of the Lakota, or
Teton Sioux, who flourished on the Great Plains of what are
now Nebraska, the Dakotas, and Wyoming. Ethnoastronomy
combines ethnography with astronomy. As an ethnoastronomer, I am less concerned with physical evidence in the
form of ruins and more interested in myths, legends, religious
belief, and current practices. In my quest to understand the astronomical thinking and customs of the nineteenth-century
Lakota, I have traveled to museums, archives, and libraries in
Nebraska, Colorado, Wyoming, South Dakota, and North
Dakota. I frequently visit the Pine Ridge and Rosebud Reservations in South Dakota. The Lakota, and other Plains In-

dians, had a rich tradition of understanding celestial motions
and developed an even richer explanation of why things appear the way they do in the sky.
My first professional contribution to ethnoastronomy was
in 1996 at the Fifth Oxford International Conference on Astronomy in Culture held in Santa Fe, New Mexico. I had noticed that images of eclipses often appeared in Lakota winter
counts—their method of making a historic record of events.
The great Leonid meteor shower of 1833 appears in almost
every Plains Indian winter count. As I looked at the hides or
in ledger books recording these winter counts, I wondered why
the Sun, the Moon, and the stars are so common among the
Lakota of 150 years ago. My curiosity led me to look deeper:
What did the Lakota think about eclipses? Why does their central ritual, the Sun Dance, focus on the Sun? Why do so many
legends involve the stars?
The Lakota observed lunar and solar eclipses. Perhaps
they felt they had the power to restore the eclipsed Sun or
Moon. In August 1869, an Indian agency physician in South
Dakota told the Lakota there would be an eclipse. When the
Sun disappeared from view, the Lakota began firing their guns
in the air. In their minds, they were more powerful than the
white doctor because the result of their action was to restore
the Sun.
The Lakota used a lunar calendar. Their names for the
months came from the world around them. October was the
moon of falling leaves. In some years, there actually are 13
new moons, and they often called this extra month the “Lost
Moon.” The lunar calendar often dictated the timing of their
sacred rites. Although the Lakota were never dogmatic about
it, they preferred to hold their most important ceremony, the
Sun Dance, at the time of the full moon in June, which is when
the summer solstice occurs.
Why did the Lakota pay attention to the night sky? Lakota
elder Ringing Shield’s statement about Polaris, recorded in the
late nineteenth century, provides a clue: “One star never moves
and it is wakan. Other stars move in a circle about it. They are
dancing in the dance circle.” For the Lakota, a driving force in
their culture was a quest to understand the nature of the sacred, or wakan. Anything hard to understand or different from
the ordinary was wakan.
Reaching for the stars, as far away as they are, was a
means for the Lakota to bring the incomprehensible universe
a bit closer to the earth. Their goal was the same as what Dr.
Sandra M. Faber says in her essay “Why Astronomy?” at the
end of Chapter 1, “a perspective on human existence and its
relation to the cosmos.”

Gravitation
and the Waltz
of the Planets
An astronaut orbits the Earth attached to the International Space
Station’s manipulator arm. (NASA)

ixty years ago the idea of humans orbiting the Earth or
sending spacecraft to other worlds was regarded as science
fiction. Today science fiction has become commonplace reality. Literally thousands of artificial satellites orbit our planet to
track weather, relay signals for communications and entertainment, and collect scientific data about the Earth and the universe.
Humans live and work in Earth orbit (as in the accompanying
photograph), have ventured as far as the Moon, and have sent
dozens of robotic spacecraft to explore all the planets of the solar system.
While we think of spaceflight as an innovation of the twentieth century, we can trace its origins to a series of scientific revolutions that began in the 1500s. The first of these revolutions
overthrew the ancient idea that the Earth is an immovable object
at the center of the universe, around which moved the Sun, the
Moon, and the planets. In this chapter we will learn how Nicolaus Copernicus, Tycho Brahe, Johannes Kepler, and Galileo
Galilei helped us understand that the Earth is itself one of several
planets orbiting the Sun.
We will learn, too, about Isaac Newton’s revolutionary discovery of why the planets move in the way that they do. This was just
one aspect of Newton’s immense body of work, which included
formulating the fundamental laws of physics and developing a

S

precise mathematical description of the force of gravitation—the
force that holds the planets in their orbits.
Gravitation proves to be a truly universal force: it guides
spacecraft as they journey across the solar system, and keeps
satellites and astronauts in their orbits. In this chapter you will
learn more about this important force of nature, which plays a
central role in all parts of astronomy.

4-1 Ancient astronomers invented
geocentric models to explain
planetary motions
Since the dawn of civilization, scholars have attempted to explain
the nature of the universe. The ancient Greeks were the first to
use the principle that still guides scientists today: The universe can
be described and understood logically. For example, more than
2500 years ago Pythagoras and his followers put forth the idea
that nature can be described with mathematics. About 200 years
later, Aristotle asserted that the universe is governed by physical
laws. One of the most important tasks before the scholars of ancient Greece was to create a model (see Section 1-1) to explain
the motions of objects in the heavens.

The Greek Geocentric Model
Most Greek scholars assumed that
the Sun, the Moon, the stars, and The scholars of ancient
the planets revolve about a stationGreece imagined that the
ary Earth. A model of this kind, in
planets followed an
which the Earth is at the center of
the universe, is called a geocentric ornate combination of
model. Similar ideas were held by circular paths
the scholars of ancient China.
Today we recognize that the stars are not merely points of
light on an immense celestial sphere. But in fact this is how the
ancient Greeks regarded the stars in their geocentric model of the
universe. To explain the diurnal motions of the stars, they assumed that the celestial sphere was real, and that it rotated around
the stationary Earth once a day.
The Sun and Moon both participated in this daily rotation of
the sky, which explained their rising and setting motions. To explain why the Sun and Moon both move slowly with respect to
the stars, the ancient Greeks imagined that both of these objects
orbit around the Earth.

ANALOGY Imagine a merry-go-round that rotates clockwise as
seen from above, as in Figure 4-1a. As it rotates, two children
walk slowly counterclockwise at different speeds around the
merry-go-round’s platform. Thus, the children rotate along with
the merry-go-round and also change their positions with respect
to the merry-go-round’s wooden horses. This scene is analogous
to the way the ancient Greeks pictured the motions of the stars,
Sun, and Moon. In their model, the celestial sphere rotated to
the west around a stationary Earth (Figure 4-1b). The stars rotate along with the celestial sphere just as the wooden horses
rotate along with the merry-go-round in Figure 4-1a. The Sun
and Moon are analogous to the two children; they both turn
westward with the celestial sphere, making one complete turn
each day, and also move slowly eastward at different speeds
with respect to the stars.

The geocentric model of the heavens also had to explain the
motions of the planets. The ancient Greeks and other cultures of
that time knew of five planets: Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter,
and Saturn, each of which is a bright object in the night sky. For
example, when Venus is at its maximum brilliancy, it is 16 times
brighter than the brightest star. (By contrast, Uranus and Neptune
are quite dim and were not discovered until after the invention of
the telescope.)
Like the Sun and Moon, all of the planets rise in the east and
set in the west once a day. And like the Sun and Moon, from
night to night the planets slowly move on the celestial sphere, that
is, with respect to the background of stars. However, the character of this motion on the celestial sphere is quite different for the
planets. Both the Sun and the Moon always move from west to
east on the celestial sphere, that is, opposite the direction in which
the celestial sphere appears to rotate. The Sun follows the path
called the ecliptic (see Section 2-5), while the Moon follows a
path that is slightly inclined to the ecliptic (see Section 3-3). Furthermore, the Sun and the Moon each move at relatively constant
speeds around the celestial sphere. (The Moon’s speed is faster
than that of the Sun: It travels all the way around the celestial
sphere in about a month while the Sun takes an entire year.) The
planets, too, appear to move along paths that are close to the
ecliptic. The difference is that each of the planets appears to wander back and forth on the celestial sphere with varying speed. As
an example, Figure 4-2 shows the wandering motion of Mars
with respect to the background of stars during 2011 and 2012.
(This figure shows that the name planet is well deserved; it comes
from a Greek word meaning “wanderer.”)

CAUTION! On a map of the Earth with north at the top, west
is to the left and east is to the right. Why, then, is east on the
left and west on the right in Figure 4-2? The answer is that a
map of the Earth is a view looking downward at the ground
from above, while a star map like Figure 4-2 is a view looking
upward at the sky. If the constellation Leo in Figure 4-2 were
directly overhead, Virgo would be toward the eastern horizon
and Cancer would be toward the western horizon.

Figure 4-2

The Path of Mars in 2011–2012 From October 2011
through August 2012, Mars will move across the zodiacal
constellations Cancer, Leo, and Virgo. Mars’s motion will be direct (from
west to east, or from right to left in this figure) most of the time but will

be retrograde (from east to west, or from left to right in this figure)
during February and March 2011. Notice that the speed of Mars relative
to the stars is not constant: The planet travels farther across the sky from
October 1 to December 1 than it does from December 1 to February 1.

Most of the time planets move slowly eastward relative to the
stars, just as the Sun and Moon do. This eastward progress is called
direct motion. For example, Figure 4-2 shows that Mars will be
in direct motion from October 2011 through January 2012 and
from April through August 2012. Occasionally, however, the
planet will seem to stop and then back up for several weeks or
months. This occasional westward movement is called retrograde
motion. Mars will undergo retrograde motion during February
and March 2012 (see Figure 4-2), and will do so again about
every 221⁄2 months. All the other planets go through retrograde
motion, but at different intervals. In the language of the merrygo-round analogy in Figure 4-1, the Greeks imagined the planets
as children walking around the rotating merry-go-round but who
keep changing their minds about which direction to walk!

As viewed from Earth, the epicycle moves eastward along the
deferent. Most of the time the eastward motion of the planet on
its epicycle adds to the eastward motion of the epicycle on the
deferent (Figure 4-3b). Then the planet is seen to be in direct
(eastward) motion against the background stars. However, when
the planet is on the part of its epicycle nearest Earth, the motion
of the planet along the epicycle is opposite to the motion of the
epicycle along the deferent. The planet therefore appears to slow
down and halt its usual eastward movement among the constellations, and actually goes backward in retrograde (westward) motion for a few weeks or months (Figure 4-3c). Thus, the concept
of epicycles and deferents enabled Greek astronomers to explain
the retrograde loops of the planets.
Using the wealth of astronomical data in the library at Alexandria, including records of planetary positions for hundreds of
years, Ptolemy deduced the sizes and rotation rates of the epicycles and deferents needed to reproduce the recorded paths of the
planets. After years of tedious work, Ptolemy assembled his calculations into 13 volumes, collectively called the Almagest. His
work was used to predict the positions and paths of the Sun,
Moon, and planets with unprecedented accuracy. In fact, the Almagest was so successful that it became the astronomer’s bible,
and for more than 1000 years, the Ptolemaic system endured as
a useful description of the workings of the heavens.
A major problem posed by the Ptolemaic system was a philosophical one: It treated each planet independent of the others.
There was no rule in the Almagest that related the size and rotation speed of one planet’s epicycle and deferent to the corresponding sizes and speeds for other planets. This problem made the
Ptolemaic system very unsatisfying to many Islamic and European
astronomers of the Middle Ages. They felt that a correct model
of the universe should be based on a simple set of underlying principles that applied to all of the planets.

over the course of a single night you will see it rise in the east
and set in the west. That’s because both direct and retrograde
motions are much slower than the apparent daily rotation of the
sky. Hence, they are best detected by mapping the position of a
planet against the background stars from night to night over a
long period. Figure 4-2 is a map of just this sort.

The Ptolemaic System

The idea that simple, straightforward explanations
of phenomena are most likely to be correct is called
Occam’s razor, after William of Occam (or Ockham),
the fourteenth-century English philosopher who first expressed it.
.2

Explaining the nonuniform motions of the five planets was one
of the main challenges facing the astronomers of antiquity. The
Greeks developed many theories to account for retrograde motion
and the loops that the planets trace out against the background
stars. One of the most successful and enduring models was originated by Apollonius of Perga and by Hipparchus in the second
century B.C. and expanded upon by Ptolemy, the last of the great
Greek astronomers, during the second century A.D. Figure 4-3a
sketches the basic concept, usually called the Ptolemaic system.
Each planet is assumed to move in a small circle called an epicycle, whose center in turn moves in a larger circle, called a deferent, which is centered approximately on the Earth. Both the
epicycle and deferent rotate in the same direction, shown as counterclockwise in Figure 4-3a.

A Geocentric Explanation of Retrograde Motion (a) The
ancient Greeks imagined that each planet moves along an
epicycle, which in turn moves along a deferent centered approximately on
the Earth. The planet moves along the epicycle more rapidly than the
epicycle moves along the deferent. (b) At most times the eastward
motion of the planet on the epicycle adds to the eastward motion of the
epicycle on the deferent. Then the planet moves eastward in direct
motion as seen from Earth. (c) When the planet is on the inside of the
deferent, its motion along the epicycle is westward. Because this motion
is faster than the eastward motion of the epicycle on the deferent, the
planet appears from Earth to be moving westward in retrograde motion.

(The “razor” refers to shaving extraneous details from an argument or explanation.) Although Occam’s razor has no proof or
verification, it appeals to the scientist’s sense of beauty and elegance, and it has helped lead to the simple and powerful laws of
nature that scientists use today. In the centuries that followed,
Occam’s razor would help motivate a new and revolutionary view
of the universe.

4-2 Nicolaus Copernicus devised the first
comprehensive heliocentric model
During the first half of the sixteenth century, a Polish lawyer,
physician, canon of the church, and gifted mathematician named
Nicolaus Copernicus (Figure 4-4) began to construct a new model
of the universe. His model, which placed the Sun at the center,
explained the motions of the planets in a more natural way than
the Ptolemaic system. As we will see, it also helped lay the foundations of modern physical science. But Copernicus was not the
first to conceive a Sun-centered model of planetary motion. In the
third century B.C., the Greek astronomer Aristarchus suggested
such a model as a way to explain retrograde motion.

Imagine riding on a fast racehorse. As you pass a slowly walking

simple observation inspired Aristarchus to formulate a heliocentric (Sun-centered) model in which

time one planet will overtake another, just as a fast-moving horse overtakes a person on foot.
When the Earth overtakes Mars, for example, Mars appears to
move backward in retrograde motion, as Figure 4-5 shows. Thus,
in the heliocentric picture, the occasional retrograde motion of a
planet is merely the result of the Earth’s motion.
As we saw in Section 3-6, Aristarchus demonstrated that the
Sun is bigger than the Earth (see Table 3-3). This made it sensible to imagine the Earth orbiting the larger Sun. He also imagined that the Earth rotated on its axis once a day, which explained

Gravitation and the Waltz of the Planets

the daily rising and setting of the Sun, Moon, and planets and the
diurnal motions of the stars. To explain why the apparent motions of the planets never take them far from the ecliptic,
Aristarchus proposed that the orbits of the Earth and all the planets must lie in nearly the same plane. (Recall from Section 2-5 that
the ecliptic is the projection onto the celestial sphere of the plane
of the Earth’s orbit.)
This heliocentric model is conceptually much simpler than an
Earth-centered system, such as that of Ptolemy, with all its “circles upon circles.” In Aristarchus’s day, however, the idea of an
orbiting, rotating Earth seemed inconceivable, given the Earth’s
apparent stillness and immobility. Nearly 2000 years would pass
before a heliocentric model found broad acceptance.

In the years after 1500, Copernicus came to realize that a heliocentric model has several advantages beyond providing a natural
explanation of retrograde motion. In the Ptolemaic system, the
arrangement of the planets—that is, which are close to the Earth
and which are far away—was chosen in large part by guesswork.
But using a heliocentric model, Copernicus could determine the
arrangement of the planets without ambiguity.
Copernicus realized that because Mercury and Venus are always observed fairly near the Sun in the sky, their orbits must be
smaller than the Earth’s. Planets in such orbits are called inferior
planets (Figure 4-6). The other visible planets—Mars, Jupiter, and
Saturn—are sometimes seen on the side of the celestial sphere opposite the Sun, so these planets appear high above the horizon
at midnight (when the Sun is far below the horizon). When this

happens, the Earth must lie between the Sun and these planets.
Copernicus therefore concluded that the orbits of Mars, Jupiter,
and Saturn must be larger than the Earth’s orbit. Hence, these
planets are called superior planets.
Uranus and Neptune, as well as Pluto and a number of other
small bodies called asteroids that also orbit the Sun, were discovered after the telescope was invented (and after the death of
Copernicus). All of these can be seen at times in the midnight sky,
so these also have orbits larger than the Earth’s.
The heliocentric model also explains why planets appear in
different parts of the sky on different dates. Both inferior planets
(Mercury and Venus) go through cycles: The planet is seen in the
west after sunset for several weeks or months, then for several
weeks or months in the east before sunrise, and then in the west
after sunset again.
Figure 4-6 shows the reason for this cycle. When Mercury or
Venus is visible after sunset, it is near greatest eastern elongation.
(The angle between the Sun and a planet as viewed from Earth is
called the planet’s elongation.) The planet’s position in the sky is
as far east of the Sun as possible, so it appears above the western
horizon after sunset (that is, to the east of the Sun) and is often
called an “evening star.” At greatest western elongation, Mercury
or Venus is as far west of the Sun as it can possibly be. It then
rises before the Sun, gracing the predawn sky as a “morning star”
in the east. When Mercury or Venus is at inferior conjunction, it
is between us and the Sun, and it is moving from the evening sky
into the morning sky. At superior conjunction, when the planet is
on the opposite side of the Sun, it is moving back into the evening
sky.
A superior planet such as Mars, whose orbit is larger than
the Earth’s, is best seen in the night sky when it is at opposition.
At this point the planet is in the part of the sky opposite the Sun
and is highest in the sky at midnight. This is also when the planet
appears brightest, because it is closest to us. But when a superior
planet like Mars is located behind the Sun at conjunction, it is
above the horizon during the daytime and thus is not well placed
for nighttime viewing.

Planetary Periods and Orbit Sizes
The Ptolemaic system has no simple rules relating the motion of
one planet to another. But Copernicus showed that there are such
rules in a heliocentric model. In particular, he found a correspondence between the time a planet takes to complete one orbit—that
is, its period—and the size of the orbit.
Determining the period of a planet takes some care, because
the Earth, from which we must make the observations, is also
moving. Realizing this, Copernicus was careful to distinguish between two different periods of each planet. The synodic period is
the time that elapses between two successive identical configurations as seen from Earth—from one opposition to the next, for
example, or from one conjunction to the next. The sidereal period is the true orbital period of a planet, the time it takes the
planet to complete one full orbit of the Sun relative to the stars.
The synodic period of a planet can be determined by observing the sky, but the sidereal period has to be found by calculation. Copernicus figured out how to do this (Box 4-1). Table 4-1
shows the results for all of the planets.

Relating Synodic and Sidereal Periods

sidereal period (the time required for the planet to comW
plete one orbit) to its synodic period (the time between two

Jupiter, or Saturn) yields

successive identical configurations). To start with, let’s consider an inferior planet (Mercury or Venus) orbiting the Sun as
shown in the accompanying figure. Let P be the planet’s sidereal period, S the planet’s synodic period, and E the Earth’s
sidereal period or sidereal year (see Section 2-8), which Copernicus knew to be nearly 3651⁄4 days.
The rate at which the Earth moves around its orbit is the
number of degrees around the orbit divided by the time to
complete the orbit, or 360°/E (equal to a little less than 1° per
day). Similarly, the rate at which the inferior planet moves
along its orbit is 360°/P.
During a given time interval, the angular distance that the
Earth moves around its orbit is its rate, (360°/E), multiplied by
the length of the time interval. Thus, during a time S, or one
synodic period of the inferior planet, the Earth covers an angular distance of (360°/E)S around its orbit. In that same time,
the inferior planet covers an angular distance of (360°/P)S.
Note, however, that the inferior planet has gained one full lap
on the Earth, and hence has covered 360° more than the Earth
has (see the figure). Thus, (360°/P)S ⫽ (360°/E)S ⫹ 360°. Dividing each term of this equation by 360°S gives

Review: Our answer means that it takes 11.87 years for
Jupiter to complete one full orbit of the Sun. This is greater
than the Earth’s 1-year sidereal period because Jupiter’s orbit
is larger than the Earth’s orbit. Jupiter’s synodic period of
1.092 years is the time from one opposition to the next, or
the time that elapses from when the Earth overtakes Jupiter
to when it next overtakes Jupiter. This is so much shorter
than the sidereal period because Jupiter moves quite slowly
around its orbit. The Earth overtakes it a little less often
than once per Earth orbit, that is, at intervals of a little bit
more than a year.

To find a relationship between the sidereal period of a planet
and the size of its orbit, Copernicus still had to determine the relative distances of the planets from the Sun. He devised a straightforward geometric method of determining the relative distances
of the planets from the Sun using trigonometry. His answers
turned out to be remarkably close to the modern values, as shown
in Table 4-2.
The distances in Table 4-2 are given in terms of the astronomical unit, which is the average distance from Earth to the Sun
(Section 1-7). Copernicus did not know the precise value of this
distance, so he could only determine the relative sizes of the orbits of the planets. One method used by modern astronomers to
determine the astronomical unit is to measure the Earth-Venus
distance very accurately using radar. At the same time, they measure the angle in the sky between Venus and the Sun, and then
calculate the Earth-Sun distance using trigonometry. In this way,
the astronomical unit is found to be 1.496 ⫻ 108 km (92.96 million miles). Once the astronomical unit is known, the average distances from the Sun to each of the planets in kilometers can be
determined from Table 4-2. A table of these distances is given in
Appendix 2.
By comparing Tables 4-1 and 4-2, you can see the unifying
relationship between planetary orbits in the Copernican model:
The farther a planet is from the Sun, the longer it takes to travel
around its orbit (that is, the longer its sidereal period). That is so
for two reasons: (1) the larger the orbit, the farther a planet must
travel to complete an orbit; and (2) the larger the orbit, the slower
a planet moves. For example, Mercury, with its small orbit, moves
at an average speed of 47.9 km/s (107,000 mi/h). Saturn travels
around its large orbit much more slowly, at an average speed of
9.64 km/s (21,600 mi/h). The older Ptolemaic model offers no
such simple relations between the motions of different planets.

The Shapes of Orbits in the Copernican Model
At first, Copernicus assumed that Earth travels around the Sun
along a circular path. He found that perfectly circular orbits could
not accurately describe the paths of the other planets, so he had

to add an epicycle to each planet. This was not to explain retrograde motion, which Copernicus realized was because of the differences in orbital speeds of different planets, as shown in Figure
4-5. Rather, the small epicycles helped Copernicus account for
slight variations in each planet’s speed along its orbit.
Even though he clung to the old notion that orbits must be
made up of circles, Copernicus had shown that a heliocentric
model could explain the motions of the planets. He compiled his
ideas and calculations into a book entitled De revolutionibus orbium coelestium (On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres),
which was published in 1543, the year of his death.
For several decades after Copernicus, most astronomers saw
little reason to change their allegiance from the older geocentric
model of Ptolemy. The predictions that the Copernican model
makes for the apparent positions of the planets are, on average,
no better or worse than those of the Ptolemaic model. The test of
Occam’s razor does not really favor either model, because both
use a combination of circles to describe each planet’s motion.
More concrete evidence was needed to convince scholars to
abandon the old, comfortable idea of a stationary Earth at the
center of the universe. The story of how this evidence was accumulated begins nearly 30 years after the death of Copernicus,
when a young Danish astronomer pondered the nature of a new
star in the heavens.

4-3 Tycho Brahe’s astronomical
observations disproved ancient ideas
about the heavens
On November 11, 1572, a bright star suddenly appeared in the
constellation of Cassiopeia. At first, it was even brighter than
Venus, but then it began to grow
dim. After 18 months, it faded from A supernova explosion
view. Modern astronomers recognize and a comet revealed to
this event as a supernova explosion, Tycho that our universe

is more dynamic than
In the sixteenth century, how- had been imagined
ever, the vast majority of scholars
held with the ancient teachings of Aristotle and Plato, who had
argued that the heavens are permanent and unalterable. Consequently, the “new star” of 1572 could not really be a star at all,
because the heavens do not change; it must instead be some sort
of bright object quite near the Earth, perhaps not much farther
away than the clouds overhead.
The 25-year-old Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe (1546–
1601) realized that straightforward observations might reveal the
distance to the new star. It is common experience that when you
walk from one place to another, nearby objects appear to change
position against the background of more distant objects. This
phenomenon, whereby the apparent position of an object changes
because of the motion of the observer, is called parallax. If the
new star was nearby, then its position should shift against the
background stars over the course of a single night because Earth’s
rotation changes our viewpoint. Figure 4-7 shows this predicted
shift. (Actually, Tycho believed that the heavens rotate about the
Earth, as in the Ptolemaic model, but the net effect is the same.)

Tycho and the Positions of the Planets
With this state-of-the-art equipment, Tycho proceeded to measure the positions of stars and planets with unprecedented accuracy. In addition, he and his assistants were careful to make several observations of the same star or planet with different
instruments, in order to identify any errors that might be caused
by the instruments themselves. This painstaking approach to mapping the heavens revolutionized the practice of astronomy and is
used by astronomers today.
A key goal of Tycho’s observations during this period was to
test the ideas Copernicus had proposed decades earlier about the
Earth going around the Sun. Tycho argued that if the Earth was
in motion, then nearby stars should appear to shift their positions
with respect to background stars as we orbit the Sun. Tycho
failed to detect any such parallax, and he concluded that the
Earth was at rest and the Copernican system was wrong.
On this point Tycho was in error, for nearby stars do in fact
shift their positions as he had suggested. But even the nearest stars
are so far away that the shifts in their positions are less than an
arcsecond, too small to be seen with the naked eye. Tycho would
have needed a telescope to detect the parallax that he was looking for, but the telescope was not invented until after his death in

Figure 4-7

.4

Tycho’s careful observations failed to disclose any parallax.
The farther away an object is, the less it appears to shift against
the background as we change our viewpoint, and the smaller the
parallax. Hence, the new star had to be quite far away, farther
from Earth than anyone had imagined. This was the first evidence
that the “unchanging” stars were in fact changeable.
Tycho also attempted to measure the parallax of a bright
comet that appeared in 1577 and, again, found it too small to
measure. Thus, the comet also had to be far beyond the Earth.
Furthermore, because the comet’s position relative to the stars
changed from night to night, its motion was more like a planet
than a star. But most scholars of Tycho’s time taught that the motions of the planets had existed in unchanging form since the beginning of the universe. If new objects such as comets could
appear and disappear within the realm of the planets, the conventional notions of planetary motions needed to be revised.
Tycho’s observations showed that the heavens are by no
means pristine and unchanging. This discovery flew in the face of
nearly 2000 years of astronomical thought. In support of these
revolutionary observations, the king of Denmark financed the
construction of two magnificent observatories for Tycho’s use on
the island of Hven, just off the Danish coast. The bequest for
these two observatories—Uraniborg (“heavenly castle”) and
Stjerneborg (“star castle”)—allowed Tycho to design and have
built a set of astronomical instruments vastly superior in quality
to any earlier instruments (Figure 4-8).

A Nearby Object Shows a Parallax Shift Tycho Brahe argued that if
an object is near the Earth, an observer would have to look in different
directions to see that object over the course of a night and its position
relative to the background stars would change. Tycho failed to measure
such changes for a supernova in 1572 and a comet in 1577. He therefore
concluded that these objects were far from the Earth.

illustration shows Tycho Brahe with some of the state-of-theart measuring apparatus at Uraniborg, one of the two observatories that
he built under the patronage of Frederik II of Denmark. (This magnificent
observatory lacked a telescope, which had not yet been invented.) The
data that Tycho collected were crucial to the development of astronomy
in the years after his death. (Photo Researchers, Inc.)

Elliptical Orbits and Kepler’s First Law
Astronomers had long assumed that heavenly objects move in circles, which were considered the most perfect and harmonious of
all geometric shapes. They believed that if a perfect God resided
in heaven along with the stars and planets, then the motions of
these objects must be perfect too. Against this context, Kepler
dared to try to explain planetary motions with noncircular curves.
In particular, he found that he had the best success with a particular kind of curve called an ellipse.
You can draw an ellipse by using a loop of string, two thumbtacks, and a pencil, as shown in Figure 4-10a. Each thumbtack in
the figure is at a focus (plural foci) of the ellipse; an ellipse has
two foci. The longest diameter of an ellipse, called the major axis,
passes through both foci. Half of that distance is called the semimajor axis and is usually designated by the letter a. A circle is a
special case of an ellipse in which the two foci are at the same
point (this corresponds to using only a single thumbtack in Figure 4-10a). The semimajor axis of a circle is equal to its radius.
By assuming that planetary orbits were ellipses, Kepler found,
to his delight, that he could make his theoretical calculations
match precisely to Tycho’s observations. This important discovery, first published in 1609, is now called Kepler’s first law:

Figure 4-9
Johannes Kepler (1571–1630) By analyzing Tycho Brahe’s

detailed records of planetary positions, Kepler developed
three general principles, called Kepler’s laws, that describe how the
planets move about the Sun. Kepler was the first to realize that the orbits
of the planets are ellipses and not circles. (E. Lessing/Magnum)

The orbit of a planet about the Sun is an ellipse with the Sun
at one focus.
The semimajor axis a of a planet’s orbit is the average distance between the planet and the Sun.

CAUTION! The Sun is at one focus of a planet’s elliptical or1601. Indeed, the first accurate determination of stellar parallax
was not made until 1838.
Although he remained convinced that the Earth was at the
center of the universe, Tycho nonetheless made a tremendous
contribution toward putting the heliocentric model on a solid
foundation. From 1576 to 1597, he used his instruments to make
comprehensive measurements of the positions of the planets with
an accuracy of 1 arcminute. This is as well as can be done with
the naked eye and was far superior to any earlier measurements.
Within the reams of data that Tycho compiled lay the truth about
the motions of the planets. The person who would extract this
truth was a German mathematician who became Tycho’s assistant in 1600, a year before the great astronomer’s death. His
name was Johannes Kepler (Figure 4-9).

4-4 Johannes Kepler proposed elliptical
paths for the planets about the Sun
The task that Johannes Kepler took on at the beginning of the
seventeenth century was to find a model of planetary motion that
agreed completely with Tycho’s extensive and very accurate observa- Kepler’s ideas apply not

bit, but there is nothing at the other focus. This “empty focus”
has geometrical significance, because it helps to define the shape
of the ellipse, but plays no other role.
Ellipses come in different shapes, depending on the elongation of the ellipse. The shape of an ellipse is described by its eccentricity, designated by the letter e. The value of e can range
from 0 (a circle) to just under 1 (nearly a straight line). The
greater the eccentricity, the more elongated the ellipse. Figure
4-10b shows a few examples of ellipses with different eccentricities. Because a circle is a special case of an ellipse, it is possible
to have a perfectly circular orbit. But all of the objects that orbit
the Sun have orbits that are at least slightly elliptical. The most
circular of any planetary orbit is that of Venus, with an eccentricity of just 0.007; Mercury’s orbit has an eccentricity of 0.206, and
a number of small bodies called comets move in very elongated
orbits with eccentricities just less than 1.

Orbital Speeds and Kepler’s Second Law
Once he knew the shape of a planet’s orbit, Kepler was ready to
describe exactly how it moves on that orbit. As a planet travels
in an elliptical orbit, its distance from the Sun varies. Kepler realized that the speed of a planet also varies along its orbit. A
planet moves most rapidly when it is nearest the Sun, at a point
on its orbit called perihelion. Conversely, a planet moves most
slowly when it is farthest from the Sun, at a point called aphelion
(Figure 4-11).

Gravitation and the Waltz of the Planets

After much trial and error, Kepler found a way to describe
just how a planet’s speed varies as it moves along its orbit. Figure 4-11 illustrates this discovery, also published in 1609. Suppose that it takes 30 days for a planet to go from point A to point
B. During that time, an imaginary line joining the Sun and the
planet sweeps out a nearly triangular area. Kepler discovered that
a line joining the Sun and the planet also sweeps out exactly the
same area during any other 30-day interval. In other words, if the
planet also takes 30 days to go from point C to point D, then the
two shaded segments in Figure 4-11 are equal in area. Kepler’s
second law can be stated thus:

Major axis

Focus

A line joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas in
equal intervals of time.

This relationship is also called the law of equal areas. In the
idealized case of a circular orbit, a planet would have to move at
a constant speed around the orbit in order to satisfy Kepler’s second law.

weights closer to her body by pulling her arms straight in, her
rate of spin increases and the weights move faster; if she extends
her arms so the weights move away from her body, her rate of
spin decreases and the weights slow down. Just like the weights,
a planet in an elliptical orbit travels at a higher speed when it
moves closer to the Sun (toward perihelion) and travels at a lower
speed when it moves away from the Sun (toward aphelion).

Orbital Periods and Kepler’s Third Law
Kepler’s second law describes how the speed of a given planet
changes as it orbits the Sun. Kepler also deduced from Tycho’s
data a relationship that can be used to compare the motions of
different planets. Published in 1618 and now called Kepler’s third
law, it states a relationship between the size of a planet’s orbit
and the time the planet takes to go once around the Sun:

Kepler’s First and Second Laws According
to Kepler’s first law, a planet travels around
the Sun along an elliptical orbit with the Sun at one
focus. According to his second law, a planet moves
fastest when closest to the Sun (at perihelion) and
slowest when farthest from the Sun (at aphelion). As the
planet moves, an imaginary line joining the planet and
the Sun sweeps out equal areas in equal intervals of
time (from A to B or from C to D). By using these laws in
his calculations, Kepler found a perfect fit to the
apparent motions of the planets.

Using Kepler’s Third Law
epler’s third law relates the sidereal period P of an object
the Sun to the semimajor axis a of its orbit:
Korbiting
P2 ⫽ a3
You must keep two essential points in mind when working with this equation:
1. The period P must be measured in years, and the
semimajor axis a must be measured in astronomical units
(AU). Otherwise you will get nonsensical results.
2. This equation applies only to the special case of an object,
like a planet, that orbits the Sun. If you want to analyze the
orbit of the Moon around the Earth, of a spacecraft around
Mars, or of a planet around a distant star, you must use a
different, generalized form of Kepler’s third law. We discuss
this alternative equation in Section 4-7 and Box 4-4.

EXAMPLE: The average distance from Venus to the Sun is
0.72 AU. Use this to determine the sidereal period of Venus.

Situation: The average distance from the Venus to the Sun is
the semimajor axis a of the planet’s orbit. Our goal is to
calculate the planet’s sidereal period P.

Review: The sidereal period of Venus is 0.61 years, or a bit
more than seven Earth months. This makes sense: A planet
with a smaller orbit than the Earth’s (an inferior planet)
must have a shorter sidereal period than the Earth.

EXAMPLE: A certain small asteroid (a rocky body a few tens
of kilometers across) takes eight years to complete one orbit
around the Sun. Find the semimajor axis of the asteroid’s
orbit.

Situation: We are given the sidereal period P ⫽ 8 years, and
are to determine the semimajor axis a.

Tools: As in the preceding example, we relate a and P using
Kepler’s third law, P2 ⫽ a3.
Answer: We first square the period:
P2 ⫽ 82 ⫽ 8 ⫻ 8 ⫽ 64
From Kepler’s third law, this is also equal to a3. To
determine a, we must take the cube root of a3, that is, find
the number whose cube is 64. If your calculator has a cube
3
root function, denoted by the symbol 兹苶, you can use it to
3
苶 ⫽ 4. Otherwise, you
find that the cube root of 64 is 4: 兹64
can determine by trial and error that the cube of 4 is 64:

Tools: To relate a and P we use Kepler’s third law, P2 ⫽ a3.
Answer: We first cube the semimajor axis (multiply it by
itself twice):
a3 ⫽ (0.72)3 ⫽ 0.72 ⫻ 0.72 ⫻ 0.72 ⫽ 0.373
According to Kepler’s third law this is also equal to P2, the
square of the sidereal period. So, to find P, we have to
“undo” the square, that is, take the square root. Using a
calculator, we find
P⫽兹
兹P
苶2 ⫽ 兹
兹0.373
苶 ⫽ 0.61

The square of the sidereal period of a planet is directly
proportional to the cube of the semimajor axis of the orbit.
Kepler’s third law says that the larger a planet’s orbit—that
is, the larger the semimajor axis, or average distance from the
planet to the Sun—the longer the sidereal period, which is the
time it takes the planet to complete an orbit. From Kepler’s third
law one can show that the larger the semimajor axis, the slower
the average speed at which the planet moves around its orbit. (By
contrast, Kepler’s second law describes how the speed of a given
planet is sometimes faster and sometimes slower than its average
speed.) This qualitative relationship between orbital size and orbital speed is just what Aristarchus and Copernicus used to ex-

43 ⫽ 4 ⫻ 4 ⫻ 4 ⫽ 64
Because the cube of 4 is 64, it follows that the cube root of
64 is 4 (taking the cube root “undoes” the cube).
With either technique you find that the orbit of this
asteroid has semimajor axis a ⫽ 4 AU.

Review: The period is greater than 1 year, so the semimajor
axis is greater than 1 AU. Note that a ⫽ 4 AU is
intermediate between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter (see
Table 4-3). Many asteroids are known with semimajor axes
in this range, forming a region in the solar system called the
asteroid belt.

plain retrograde motion, as we saw in Section 4-2. Kepler’s great
contribution was to make this relationship a quantitative one.
It is useful to restate Kepler’s third law as an equation. If a
planet’s sidereal period P is measured in years and the length of
its semimajor axis a is measured in astronomical units (AU),
where 1 AU is the average distance from the Earth to the Sun (see
Section 1-7), then Kepler’s third law is

Kepler’s third law states that P2 ⫽ a3 for each of the planets. The last
two columns of this table demonstrate that this relationship holds true
to a very high level of accuracy.

If you know either the sidereal period of a planet or the semimajor axis of its orbit, you can find the other quantity using this
equation. Box 4-2 gives some examples of how this is done.
We can verify Kepler’s third law for all of the planets, including those that were discovered after Kepler’s death, using data
from Tables 4-1 and 4-2. If Kepler’s third law is correct, for each
planet the numerical values of P2 and a3 should be equal. This is
indeed true to very high accuracy, as Table 4-3 shows.

While Galileo did not invent the transform our picture of

one of these new devices toward the
sky and to publish his observations. Beginning in 1610, he saw
sights of which no one had ever dreamed. He discovered mountains on the Moon, sunspots on the Sun, and the rings of Saturn,
and he was the first to see that the Milky Way is not a featureless band of light but rather “a mass of innumerable stars.”

The Phases of Venus
One of Galileo’s most important discoveries with the telescope
was that Venus exhibits phases like those of the Moon (Figure
4-13). Galileo also noticed that the apparent size of Venus as seen
through his telescope was related to the planet’s phase. Venus appears small at gibbous phase and largest at crescent phase. There
is also a correlation between the phases of Venus and the planet’s
angular distance from the Sun.
Figure 4-14 shows that these relationships are entirely compatible with a heliocentric model in which the Earth and Venus
both go around the Sun. They are also completely incompatible

Kepler’s laws are a landmark in the history of astronomy. They
made it possible to calculate the motions of the planets with better accuracy than any geocentric model ever had, and they helped
to justify the idea of a heliocentric model. Kepler’s laws also pass
the test of Occam’s razor, for they are simpler in every way than
the schemes of Ptolemy or Copernicus, both of which used a complicated combination of circles.
But the significance of Kepler’s laws goes beyond understanding planetary orbits. These same laws are also obeyed by spacecraft orbiting the Earth, by two stars revolving about each other
in a binary star system, and even by galaxies in their orbits about
each other. Throughout this book, we shall use Kepler’s laws in
a wide range of situations.
As impressive as Kepler’s accomplishments were, he did not
prove that the planets orbit the Sun, nor was he able to explain
why planets move in accordance with his three laws. These advances were made by two other figures who loom large in the history of astronomy: Galileo Galilei and Isaac Newton.

Figure 4-12
Galileo Galilei (1564–1642) Galileo was one of the first

people to use a telescope to observe the heavens. He
discovered craters on the Moon, sunspots on the Sun, the phases of
Venus, and four moons orbiting Jupiter. His observations strongly
suggested that the Earth orbits the Sun, not vice versa. (Eric Lessing/Art

the Earth. To explain why Venus is never seen very far from the
Sun, the Ptolemaic model had to assume that the deferents of
Venus and of the Sun move together in lockstep, with the epicycle of Venus centered on a straight line between the Earth and the
Sun (Figure 4-15). In this model, Venus was never on the opposite side of the Sun from the Earth, and so it could never have
shown the gibbous phases that Galileo observed.

Galileo also found more unexpected evidence for the ideas of
Copernicus. In 1610 Galileo discovered four moons, now called
the Galilean satellites, orbiting Jupiter (Figure 4-16). He realized
that they were orbiting Jupiter because they appeared to move
back and forth from one side of the planet to the other. Figure
4-17 shows confirming observations made by Jesuit observers in
1620. Astronomers soon realized that the larger the orbit of one
of the moons around Jupiter, the slower that moon moves and
the longer it takes that moon to travel around its orbit. These are
the same relationships that Copernicus deduced for the motions
of the planets around the Sun. Thus, the moons of Jupiter behave
like a Copernican system in miniature.
Galileo’s telescopic observations constituted the first fundamentally new astronomical data in almost 2000 years. Contradicting
prevailing opinion and religious belief, his discoveries strongly suggested a heliocentric structure of the universe. The Roman Catholic
Church, which was a powerful political force in Italy and whose

The Appearance of Venus in the Ptolemaic Model In the geocentric

never see Venus as more than half illuminated. (At positions a and c,
Venus appears in a “new” phase; at positions b and d, it appears as a
crescent. Compare with Figure 3-2, which shows the phases of the Moon.)
Because Galileo saw Venus in nearly fully illuminated phases, he
concluded that the Ptolemaic model must be incorrect.

doctrine at the time placed the Earth at the center of the universe,
cautioned Galileo not to advocate a heliocentric model. He nonetheless persisted and was sentenced to spend the last years of his life
under house arrest “for vehement suspicion of heresy.” Nevertheless, there was no turning back. (The Roman Catholic Church
lifted its ban against Galileo’s heliocentric ideas in the 1700s.)
While Galileo’s observations showed convincingly that the
Ptolemaic model was entirely wrong and that a heliocentric model
is the more nearly correct one, he was unable to provide a complete explanation of why the Earth should orbit the Sun and not
vice versa. The first person who was able to provide such an explanation was the Englishman Isaac Newton, born on Christmas
Day of 1642, a dozen years after the death of Kepler and the same
year that Galileo died. While Kepler and Galileo revolutionized
our understanding of planetary motions, Newton’s contribution
was far greater: He deduced the basic laws that govern all motions on Earth as well as in the heavens.

Early Observations of Jupiter’s Moons In 1610 Galileo discovered four
“stars” that move back and forth across Jupiter from one night to the

our Moon orbits the Earth. This drawing shows notations made by Jesuit
observers on successive nights in 1620. The circle represents Jupiter and
the stars its moons. Compare the drawing numbered 13 with the

Chapter 4

4-6 Isaac Newton formulated three laws
that describe fundamental properties of
physical reality
Until the mid-seventeenth century, virtually all attempts to describe the motions of the heavens were empirical, or based directly
on data and observations. From
Ptolemy to Kepler, astronomers The same laws of motion
would adjust their ideas and calcu- that hold sway on Earth
lations by trial and error until they apply throughout the
ended up with answers that agreed universe
with observation.
Isaac Newton (Figure 4-18) introduced a new approach. He
began with three quite general statements, now called Newton’s
laws of motion. These laws, deduced from experimental observation, apply to all forces and all objects. Newton then showed that
Kepler’s three laws follow logically from these laws of motion
and from a formula for the force of gravity that he derived from
observation.
In other words, Kepler’s laws are not just an empirical description of the motions of the planets, but a direct consequence
of the fundamental laws of physical matter. Using this deeper insight into the nature of motions in the heavens, Newton and his

successors were able to describe accurately not just the orbits of
the planets but also the orbits of the Moon and comets.

Newton’s First Law
Newton’s laws of motion describe objects on Earth as well as in
the heavens. Thus, we can understand each of these laws by considering the motions of objects around us. We begin with Newton’s first law of motion:
An object remains at rest, or moves in a straight line at a
constant speed, unless acted upon by a net outside force.
By force we mean any push or pull that acts on the object.
An outside force is one that is exerted on the object by something
other than the object itself. The net, or total, outside force is the
combined effect of all of the individual outside forces that act on
the object.
Right now, you are demonstrating the first part of Newton’s
first law. As you sit in your chair reading this, there are two outside forces acting on you: The force of gravity pulls you downward, and the chair pushes up on you. These two forces are of
equal strength but of opposite direction, so their effects cancel—
there is no net outside force. Hence, your body remains at rest as
stated in Newton’s first law. If you try to lift yourself out of your
chair by grabbing your knees and pulling up, you will remain at
rest because this force is not an outside force.

CAUTION! The second part of Newton’s first law, about objects in motion, may seem to go against common sense. If you
want to make this book move across the floor in a straight line
at a constant speed, you must continually push on it. You might
therefore think that there is a net outside force, the force of your
push. But another force also acts on the book—the force of friction as the book rubs across the floor. As you push the book
across the floor, the force of your push exactly balances the
force of friction, so again there is no net outside force. The effect is to make the book move in a straight line at constant
speed, just as Newton’s first law says. If you stop pushing, there
will be nothing to balance the effects of friction. Then there will
be a net outside force and the book will slow to a stop.
Newton’s first law tells us that if no net outside force acts on
a moving object, there can be no net outside force acting on that
object. This means that a net outside force must be acting on the
planets. To see why, note that a planet moving through empty
space encounters no friction, so the planet would tend to fly off
into space at a steady speed along a straight line if there were no
other outside force acting on it. Because this does not happen,
Newton concluded that a force must act continuously on the
planets to keep them in their elliptical orbits.

Newton’s Second Law

Figure 4-18
Isaac Newton (1642–1727) Using mathematical

techniques that he devised, Isaac Newton formulated the law
of universal gravitation and demonstrated that the planets orbit the Sun
according to simple mechanical rules. (National Portrait Gallery, London)

Newton’s second law describes how the motion of an object
changes if there is a net outside force acting on it. To appreciate
Newton’s second law, we must first understand three quantities
that describe motion—speed, velocity, and acceleration.
Speed is a measure of how fast an object is moving. Speed
and direction of motion together constitute an object’s velocity.

Gravitation and the Waltz of the Planets

Compared with a car driving north at 100 km/h (62 mi/h), a car
driving east at 100 km/h has the same speed but a different velocity. We can restate Newton’s first law to say that an object has
a constant velocity (its speed and direction of motion do not
change) if no net outside force acts on the object.
Acceleration is the rate at which velocity changes. Because velocity involves both speed and direction, acceleration can result
from changes in either. Contrary to popular use of the term, acceleration does not simply mean speeding up. A car is accelerating if it is speeding up, and it is also accelerating if it is slowing
down or turning (that is, changing the direction in which it is
moving).
You can verify these statements about acceleration if you
think about the sensations of riding in a car. If the car is moving
with a constant velocity (in a straight line at a constant speed),
you feel the same as if the car were not moving at all. But you
can feel it when the car accelerates in any way: You feel thrown
back in your seat if the car speeds up, thrown forward if the car

BOX 4-3

81

slows down, and thrown sideways if the car changes direction in
a tight turn. In Box 4-3 we discuss the reasons for these sensations, along with other applications of Newton’s laws to everyday life.
An apple falling from a tree is a good example of acceleration that involves only an increase in speed. Initially, at the moment the stem breaks, the apple’s speed is zero. After 1 second,
its downward speed is 9.8 meters per second, or 9.8 m/s (32 feet
per second, or 32 ft/s). After 2 seconds, the apple’s speed is twice
this, or 19.6 m/s. After 3 seconds, the speed is 29.4 m/s. Because
the apple’s speed increases by 9.8 m/s for each second of free fall,
the rate of acceleration is 9.8 meters per second per second, or
9.8 m/s2 (32 ft/s2). Thus, the Earth’s gravity gives the apple a constant acceleration of 9.8 m/s2 downward, toward the center of the
Earth.
A planet revolving about the Sun along a perfectly circular
orbit is an example of acceleration that involves change of direction only. As the planet moves along its orbit, its speed remains

Newton’s Laws in Everyday Life
n our study of astronomy, we use Newton’s three laws of
motion to help us understand the motions of objects in the
Iheavens.
But you can see applications of Newton’s laws every
day in the world around you. By considering these everyday
applications, we can gain insight into how Newton’s laws apply to celestial events that are far removed from ordinary human experience.
Newton’s first law, or principle of inertia, says that an object at rest naturally tends to remain at rest and that an object
in motion naturally tends to remain in motion. This explains
the sensations that you feel when riding in an automobile.
When you are waiting at a red light, your car and your body
are both at rest. When the light turns green and you press on
the gas pedal, the car accelerates forward but your body attempts to stay where it was. Hence, the seat of the accelerating car pushes forward into your body, and it feels as though
you are being pushed back in your seat.
Once the car is up to cruising speed, your body wants to
keep moving in a straight line at this cruising speed. If the car
makes a sharp turn to the left, the right side of the car will
move toward you. Thus, you will feel as though you are being
thrown to the car’s right side (the side on the outside of the
turn). If you bring the car to a sudden stop by pressing on the
brakes, your body will continue moving forward until the seat
belt stops you. In this case, it feels as though you are being
thrown toward the front of the car.
Newton’s second law states that the net outside force on
an object equals the product of the object’s mass and its acceleration. You can accelerate a crumpled-up piece of paper to a
pretty good speed by throwing it with a moderate force. But if
you try to throw a heavy rock by using the same force, the acceleration will be much less because the rock has much more

mass than the crumpled paper. Because of the smaller acceleration, the rock will leave your hand moving at only a slow
speed.
Automobile airbags are based on the relationship between
force and acceleration. It takes a large force to bring a fastmoving object suddenly to rest because this requires a large acceleration. In a collision, the driver of a car not equipped with
airbags is jerked to a sudden stop and the large forces that act
can cause major injuries. But if the car has airbags that deploy
in an accident, the driver’s body will slow down more gradually as it contacts the airbag, and the driver’s acceleration will
be less. (Remember that acceleration can refer to slowing down
as well as to speeding up.) Hence, the force on the driver and
the chance of injury will both be greatly reduced.
Newton’s third law, the principle of action and reaction,
explains how a car can accelerate at all. It is not correct to say
that the engine pushes the car forward, because Newton’s second law tells us that it takes a force acting from outside the
car to make the car accelerate. Rather, the engine makes the
wheels and tires turn, and the tires push backward on the
ground. (You can see this backward force in action when a car
drives through wet ground and sprays mud backward from the
tires.) From Newton’s third law, the ground must exert an
equally large forward force on the car, and this is the force that
pushes the car forward.
You use the same principles when you walk: You push
backward on the ground with your foot, and the ground pushes
forward on you. Icy pavement or a freshly waxed floor have
greatly reduced friction. In these situations, your feet and the
surface under you can exert only weak forces on each other,
and it is much harder to walk.

Chapter 4

constant. Nevertheless, the planet is continuously being accelerated because its direction of motion is continuously changing.
Newton’s second law of motion says that in order to give an
object an acceleration (that is, to change its velocity), a net outside force must act on the object. To be specific, this law says that
the acceleration of an object is proportional to the net outside
force acting on the object. That is, the harder you push on an object, the greater the resulting acceleration. This law can be succinctly stated as an equation. If a net outside force F acts on an
object of mass m, the object will experience an acceleration a such
that
Newton’s second law
F ⫽ ma
F ⫽ net outside force on an object
m ⫽ mass of object

The mass of an object is a measure of the total amount of
material in the object. It is usually expressed in kilograms (kg) or
grams (g). For example, the mass of the Sun is 2 ⫻ 1030 kg, the
mass of a hydrogen atom is 1.7 ⫻ 10⫺27 kg, and the mass of an
average adult is 75 kg. The Sun, a hydrogen atom, and a person
have these masses regardless of where they happen to be in the
universe.

CAUTION! It is important not to confuse the concepts of mass
and weight. Weight is the force of gravity that acts on an object
and, like any force, is usually expressed in pounds or newtons
(1 newton ⫽ 0.225 pound).
We can use Newton’s second law to relate mass and weight.
We have seen that the acceleration caused by the Earth’s gravity
is 9.8 m/s2. When a 50-kg swimmer falls from a diving board, the
only outside force acting on her as she falls is her weight. Thus,
from Newton’s second law (F ⫽ ma), her weight is equal to her
mass multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity:
50 kg ⫻ 9.8 m/s2 ⫽ 490 newtons ⫽ 110 pounds
Note that this answer is correct only when the swimmer is on
Earth. She would weigh less on the Moon, where the pull of gravity is weaker, and more on Jupiter, where the gravitational pull is
stronger. Floating deep in space, she would have no weight at all;
she would be “weightless.” Nevertheless, in all these circumstances, she would always have exactly the same mass, because
mass is an inherent property of matter unaffected by details of the
environment. Whenever we describe the properties of planets,
stars, or galaxies, we speak of their masses, never of their weights.
We have seen that a planet is continually accelerating as it orbits the Sun. From Newton’s second law, this means that there
must be a net outside force that acts continually on each of the
planets. As we will see in the next section, this force is the gravitational attraction of the Sun.

Newton’s Third Law
The last of Newton’s general laws of motion, called Newton’s
third law of motion, is the famous statement about action and
reaction:
Whenever one object exerts a force on a second object, the
second object exerts an equal and opposite force on the first
object.
For example, if you weigh 110 pounds, when you are standing up you are pressing down on the floor with a force of 110
pounds. Newton’s third law tells us that the floor is also pushing
up against your feet with an equal force of 110 pounds. You can
think of each of these forces as a reaction to the other force,
which is the origin of the phrase “action and reaction.”
Newton realized that because the Sun is exerting a force on
each planet to keep it in orbit, each planet must also be exerting
an equal and opposite force on the Sun. However, the planets are
much less massive than the Sun (for example, the Earth has only
1/300,000 of the Sun’s mass). Therefore, although the Sun’s force
on a planet is the same as the planet’s force on the Sun, the
planet’s much smaller mass gives it a much larger acceleration, according to Newton’s second law. This is why the planets circle
the Sun instead of vice versa. Thus, Newton’s laws reveal the reason for our heliocentric solar system.

4-7 Newton’s description of gravity
accounts for Kepler’s laws and explains
the motions of the planets
Tie a ball to one end of a piece of string, hold the other end of
the string in your hand, and whirl the ball around in a circle. As
the ball “orbits” your hand, it is continuously accelerating because its velocity is changing. (Even if its speed is constant, its direction of motion is changing.) In accordance with Newton’s
second law, this can happen only if the ball is continuously acted
on by an outside force—the pull of the string. The pull is directed
along the string toward your hand. In the same way, Newton
saw, the force that keeps a planet in orbit around the Sun is a pull
that always acts toward the Sun. That pull is gravity, or gravitational force.
Newton’s discovery about the Newton’s law of
forces that act on planets led him to
gravitation is truly
suspect that the force of gravity
pulling a falling apple straight down universal: it applies to
to the ground is fundamentally the falling apples as well as
same as the force on a planet that is to planets and galaxies
always directed straight at the Sun.
In other words, gravity is the force that shapes the orbits of the
planets. What is more, he was able to determine how the force of
gravity depends on the distance between the Sun and the planet.
His result was a law of gravitation that could apply to the motion of distant planets as well as to the flight of a football on
Earth. Using this law, Newton achieved the remarkable goal of
deducing Kepler’s laws from fundamental principles of nature.

To see how Newton reasoned, think again about a ball attached to a string. If you use a short string, so that the ball orbits
in a small circle, and whirl the ball around your hand at a high
speed, you will find that you have to pull fairly hard on the string
(Figure 4-19a). But if you use a longer string, so that the ball
moves in a larger orbit, and if you make the ball orbit your hand
at a slow speed, you only have to exert a light tug on the string
(Figure 4-19b). The orbits of the planets behave in the same way;
the larger the size of the orbit, the slower the planet’s speed (Figure 4-19c, d). By analogy to the force of the string on the orbiting ball, Newton concluded that the force that attracts a planet
toward the Sun must decrease with increasing distance between
the Sun and the planet.

The Law of Universal Gravitation
Using his own three laws and Kepler’s three laws, Newton succeeded in formulating a general statement that describes the nature of the gravitational force. Newton’s law of universal
gravitation is as follows:
Two objects attract each other with a force that is directly
proportional to the mass of each object and inversely
proportional to the square of the distance between them.
This law states that any two objects exert gravitational pulls
on each other. Normally, you notice only the gravitational force

that the Earth exerts on you, otherwise known as your weight. In
fact, you feel gravitational attractions to all the objects around
you. For example, this book is exerting a gravitational force on
you as you read it. But because the force exerted on you by this
book is proportional to the book’s mass, which is very small compared to the Earth’s mass, the force is too small to notice. (It can
actually be measured with sensitive equipment.)
Consider two 1-kg objects separated by a distance of 1 meter.
Newton’s law of universal gravitation says that the force is directly
proportional to the mass, so if we double the mass of one object
to 2 kg, the force between the objects will double. If we double
both masses so that we have two 2-kg objects separated by 1 meter, the force will be 2 ⫻ 2 ⫽ 4 times what it was originally (the
force is directly proportional to the mass of each object). If we go
back to two 1-kg masses, but double their separation to 2 meters,
the force will be only one-quarter its original value. This is because
the force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance: If
we double the distance, the force is multiplied by a factor of

Newton’s law of universal gravitation can be stated more
succinctly as an equation. If two objects have masses m1 and m2
and are separated by a distance r, then the gravitational force F
between these two objects is given by the following equation:

We can use Newton’s law of universal gravitation to calculate the force with which any two objects attract each other. For
example, to compute the gravitational force that the Sun exerts

G into Newton’s equation. We get

Moon in orbit around the Earth. It is also the force that keeps artificial satellites in orbit. But if the force of gravity attracts two
objects to each other, why don’t satellites immediately fall to
Earth? Why doesn’t the Moon fall into the Earth? And, for that
matter, why don’t the planets fall into the Sun?
To see the answer, imagine (as Newton did) dropping a ball
from a great height above the Earth’s surface, as in Figure 4-20.
After you drop the ball, it, of course, falls straight down (path A
in Figure 4-20). But if you throw the ball horizontally, it travels
some distance across the Earth’s surface before hitting the ground
(path B). If you throw the ball harder, it travels a greater distance
(path C). If you could throw at just the right speed, the curvature
of the ball’s path will exactly match the curvature of the Earth’s
surface (path E). Although the Earth’s gravity is making the ball
fall, the Earth’s surface is falling away under the ball at the same
rate. Hence, the ball does not get any closer to the surface, and
the ball is in circular orbit. So the ball in path E is in fact falling,
but it is falling around the Earth rather than toward the Earth.
A spacecraft is launched into orbit in just this way—by throwing it fast enough. The thrust of a rocket is used to give the spacecraft the necessary orbital speed. Once the spacecraft is in orbit,
the rocket turns off and the spacecraft falls continually around
the Earth.

If we calculate the force that the Earth exerts on the Sun, we
get exactly the same result. (Mathematically, we just let m1 be the
Sun’s mass and m2 be the Earth’s mass instead of the other way
around. The product of the two numbers is the same, so the force
is the same.) This is in accordance with Newton’s third law: Any
two objects exert equal gravitational forces on each other.
Your weight is just the gravitational force that the Earth exerts on you, so we can calculate it using Newton’s law of universal gravitation. The Earth’s mass is m1 ⫽ 5.98 ⫻ 1024 kg, and the

a circular orbit, the ball’s orbit is an ellipse.

CAUTION! An astronaut on board an orbiting spacecraft (like
the one shown in the photograph that opens this chapter) feels
“weightless.” However, this is not because she is “beyond the
pull of gravity.” The astronaut is herself an independent satellite of the Earth, and the Earth’s gravitational pull is what holds
her in orbit. She feels “weightless” because she and her spacecraft are falling together around the Earth, so there is nothing
pushing her against any of the spacecraft walls. You feel the
same “weightless” sensation whenever you are falling, such as
when you jump off a diving board or ride the free-fall ride at an
amusement park.

Newton’s form of Kepler’s third law is valid whenever two
objects orbit each other because of their mutual gravitational attraction (Figure 4-21). It is invaluable in the study of binary star
systems, in which two stars orbit each other. If the orbital period

If the ball in Figure 4-20 is thrown with a slightly slower
speed than that required for a circular orbit, its orbit will be an
ellipse (path D). An elliptical orbit also results if instead the ball
is thrown a bit too fast (path F). In this way, spacecraft can be
placed into any desired orbit around the Earth by adjusting the
thrust of the rockets.
Just as the ball in Figure 4-20 will not fall to Earth if given
enough speed, the Moon does not fall to Earth and the planets do
not fall into the Sun. The planets acquired their initial speeds
around the Sun when the solar system first formed 4.56 billion
years ago. Figure 4-20 shows that a circular orbit is a very special case, so it is no surprise that the orbits of the planets are not
precisely circular.

CAUTION! Orbiting satellites do sometimes fall out of orbit
and crash back to Earth. When this happens, however, the real
culprit is not gravity but air resistance. A satellite in a relatively
low orbit is actually flying through the tenuous outer wisps of
the Earth’s atmosphere. The resistance of the atmosphere slows
the satellite and changes a circular orbit like E in Figure 4-20 to
an elliptical one like D. As the satellite sinks to lower altitude,
it encounters more air resistance and sinks even lower. Eventually, it either strikes the Earth or burns up in flight due to air
friction. By contrast, the Moon and planets orbit in the nearvacuum of interplanetary space. Hence, they are unaffected
by this kind of air resistance, and their orbits are much more
long-lasting.

Using his three laws of motion and his law of gravity, Newton
found that he could derive Kepler’s three laws mathematically.
Kepler’s first law, concerning the elliptical shape of planetary orbits, proved to be a direct consequence of the 1/r2 factor in the
law of universal gravitation. (Had the nature of gravity in our
universe been different, so that this factor was given by a different function such as 1/r or 1/r3, elliptical orbits would not have
been possible.) The law of equal areas, or Kepler’s second law,
turns out to be a consequence of the Sun’s gravitational force on
a planet being directed straight toward the Sun.
Newton also demonstrated that Kepler’s third law follows
logically from his law of gravity. Specifically, he proved that if
two objects with masses m1 and m2 orbit each other, the period
P of their orbit and the semimajor axis a of their orbit (that is,

Chapter 4

P and semimajor axis a of the two stars in a binary system are
known, astronomers can use this formula to calculate the sum
m1 ⫹ m2 of the masses of the two stars. Within our own solar system, Newton’s form of Kepler’s third law makes it possible to
learn about the masses of planets. By measuring the period and
semimajor axis for a satellite, astronomers can determine the sum
of the masses of the planet and the satellite. (The satellite can be
a moon of the planet or a spacecraft that we place in orbit around
the planet. Newton’s laws apply in either case.) Box 4-4 gives an
example of using Newton’s form of Kepler’s third law.
Newton also discovered new features of orbits around the
Sun. For example, his equations soon led him to conclude that the

orbit of an object around the Sun need not be an ellipse. It could
be any one of a family of curves called conic sections.
A conic section is any curve that you get by cutting a cone
with a plane, as shown in Figure 4-22. You can get circles and ellipses by slicing all the way through the cone. You can also get
two types of open curves called parabolas and hyperbolas. If you
were to throw the ball in Figure 4-20 with a fast enough speed,
it would follow a parabolic or hyperbolic orbit and would fly off
into space, never to return. Comets hurtling toward the Sun from
the depths of space sometimes follow hyperbolic orbits.

Newton’s Form of Kepler’s Third Law
epler’s original statement of his third law, P2 ⫽ a3, is valid
only for objects that orbit the Sun. (Box 4-2 shows how to
use this equation.) But Newton’s form of Kepler’s third law is
much more general: It can be used in any situation where two
objects of masses m1 and m2 orbit each other. For example,
Newton’s form is the equation to use for a moon orbiting a
planet or a satellite orbiting the Earth. This equation is

K

Tools: Because this is not an orbit around the Sun, we must
use Newton’s form of Kepler’s third law to relate P and a.
This relationship also involves m1 and m2, whose sum
(m1 ⫹ m2) we are asked to find.
Answer: To solve for m1 ⫹ m2, we rewrite the equation in

Review: Io is very much smaller than Jupiter, so its mass is
only a small fraction of the mass of Jupiter. Thus, m1 ⫹ m2
is very nearly the mass of Jupiter alone. We conclude that
Jupiter has a mass of 1.90 ⫻ 1027 kg, or about 300 times the
mass of Earth. This technique can be used to determine the
mass of any object that has a second, much smaller object
orbiting it. Astronomers use this technique to find the masses
of stars, black holes, and entire galaxies of stars.

Newton’s ideas turned out to be applicable to an incredibly wide
range of situations. Using his laws of motion, Newton himself
proved that the Earth’s axis of rotation must precess because of
the gravitational pull of the Moon and the Sun on the Earth’s
equatorial bulge (see Figure 2-19). In fact, all the details of the
orbits of the planets and their satellites could be explained mathematically with a body of knowledge built on Newton’s work
that is today called Newtonian mechanics.
Not only could Newtonian mechanics explain a variety of
known phenomena in detail, but it could also predict new phenomena. For example, one of Newton’s friends, Edmund Halley,
was intrigued by three similar historical records of a comet that
had been sighted at intervals of 76 years. Assuming these records
to be accounts of the same comet, Halley used Newton’s methods to work out the details of the comet’s orbit and predicted its
return in 1758. It was first sighted on Christmas night of 1757,
a fitting memorial to Newton’s birthday. To this day the comet
bears Halley’s name (Figure 4-23).
Another dramatic success of Newton’s ideas was their role in
the discovery of the eighth planet from the Sun. The seventh planet,
Uranus, was discovered accidentally by William Herschel in 1781
during a telescopic survey of the sky. Fifty years later, however, it
was clear that Uranus was not following its predicted orbit. John
Couch Adams in England and Urbain Le Verrier in France independently calculated that the gravitational pull of a yet unknown,
more distant planet could explain the deviations of Uranus from
its orbit. Le Verrier predicted that the planet would be found at a
certain location in the constellation of Aquarius. A brief telescopic
search on September 23, 1846, revealed the planet Neptune within
1° of the calculated position. Before it was sighted with a telescope, Neptune was actually predicted with pencil and paper.
Because it has been so successful in explaining and predicting
many important phenomena, Newtonian mechanics has become
the cornerstone of modern physical science. Even today, as we
send astronauts into Earth orbit and spacecraft to the outer planets, Newton’s equations are used to calculate the orbits and trajectories of these spacecraft. The Cosmic Connections figure on
the next page summarizes some of the ways that gravity plays an
important role on scales from apples to galaxies.

In the twentieth century, scientists found that Newton’s laws
do not apply in all situations. A new theory called quantum mechanics had to be developed to explain the behavior of matter on
the very smallest of scales, such as within the atom and within the
atomic nucleus. Albert Einstein developed the theory of relativity
to explain what happens at very high speeds approaching the
speed of light and in places where gravitational forces are very
strong. For many purposes in astronomy, however, Newton’s
laws are as useful today as when Newton formulated them more
than three centuries ago.

4-8 Gravitational forces between the Earth
and Moon produce tides
We have seen how Newtonian mechanics explains why the Moon
stays in orbit around the Earth. It also explains why there are ocean
tides, as well as why the Moon always keeps the same face toward the Earth. Both of these are
the result of tidal forces—a conse- Tidal forces reveal how

Tidal forces are differences in drawing them together
the gravitational pull at different
points in an object. As an illustration, imagine that three billiard
balls are lined up in space at some distance from a planet, as in
Figure 4-24a. According to Newton’s law of universal gravitation, the force of attraction between two objects is greater the
closer the two objects are to each other. Thus, the planet exerts
more force on the 3-ball (in red) than on the 2-ball (in blue), and

exerts more force on the 2-ball than on the 1-ball (in yellow).
Now, imagine that the three balls are released and allowed to fall
toward the planet. Figure 4-24b shows the situation a short time
later. Because of the differences in gravitational pull, a short time
later the 3-ball will have moved farther than the 2-ball, which will
in turn have moved farther than the 1-ball. But now imagine that
same motion from the perspective of the 2-ball. From this perspective, it appears as though the 3-ball is pulled toward the
planet while the 1-ball is pushed away (Figure 4-24c). These apparent pushes and pulls are called tidal forces.

Tidal Forces on the Earth (a) The Moon exerts different gravitational
pulls at different locations on the Earth. (b) At any location, the tidal
force equals the Moon’s gravitational pull at that location minus the
gravitational pull of the Moon at the center of the Earth. These tidal
forces tend to deform the Earth into a nonspherical shape.

Figure 4-24

The Origin of Tidal Forces (a) Imagine three identical
billiard balls placed some distance from a planet and
released. (b) The closer a ball is to the planet, the more gravitational
force the planet exerts on it. Thus, a short time after the balls are
released, the blue 2-ball has moved farther toward the planet than the
yellow 1-ball, and the red 3-ball has moved farther still. (c) From the
perspective of the 2-ball in the center, it appears that forces have pushed
the 1-ball away from the planet and pulled the 3-ball toward the planet.
These forces are called tidal forces.

The Moon has a similar effect on the Earth as the planet in Figure
4-24 has on the three billiard balls. The arrows in Figure 4-25a
indicate the strength and direction of the gravitational force of the
Moon at several locations on the Earth. The side of the Earth
closest to the Moon feels a greater gravitational pull than the
Earth’s center does, and the side of the Earth that faces away
from the Moon feels less gravitational pull than does the Earth’s
center. This means that just as for the billiard balls in Figure
4-24, there are tidal forces acting on the Earth (Figure 4-25b).
These tidal forces exerted by the Moon try to elongate the Earth
along a line connecting the centers of the Earth and the Moon and

try to squeeze the Earth inward in the direction perpendicular to
that line.
Because the body of the Earth is largely rigid, it cannot deform very much in response to the tidal forces of the Moon. But
the water in the oceans can and does deform into a football shape,
as Figure 4-26a shows. As the Earth rotates, a point on its surface goes from where the water is shallow to where the water is
deep and back again. This is the origin of low and high ocean
tides. (In this simplified description we have assumed that the
Earth is completely covered with water. The full story of the tides
is much more complex, because the shapes of the continents and
the effects of winds must also be taken into account.)
The Sun also exerts tidal forces on the Earth’s oceans. (The
tidal effects of the Sun are about half as great as those of the
Moon.) When the Sun, Moon, and the Earth are aligned, which
happens at either new moon or full moon, the tidal effects of the
Sun and Moon reinforce each other and the tidal distortion of the
oceans is greatest. This produces large shifts in water level called
spring tides (Figure 4-26b). At first quarter and last quarter, when
the Sun and Moon form a right angle with the Earth, the tidal effects of the Sun and Moon partially cancel each other. Hence, the
tidal distortion of the oceans is the least pronounced, producing
smaller tidal shifts called neap tides (Figure 4-26c).

CAUTION! Note that spring tides have nothing to do with the
season of the year called spring. Instead, the name refers to the
way that the ocean level “springs up” to a greater than normal
height. Spring tides occur whenever there is a new moon or full
moon, no matter what the season of the year.

Tidal Forces on the Moon and Beyond
Just as the Moon exerts tidal forces on the Earth, the Earth exerts tidal forces on the Moon. Soon after the Moon formed some
4.56 billion years ago, it was molten throughout its volume. The
Earth’s tidal forces deformed the molten Moon into a slightly
elongated shape, with the long axis of the Moon pointed toward
the Earth. The Moon retained this shape and orientation when it
cooled and solidified. To keep its long axis pointed toward the
Earth, the Moon spins once on its axis as it makes one orbit
around the Earth—that is, it is in synchronous rotation (Section
3-2). Hence, the same side of the Moon always faces the Earth,

Tidal Forces on a Galaxy For millions of years the galaxies
NGC 2207 and IC 2163 have been moving ponderously past
each other. The larger galaxy’s tremendous tidal forces have
drawn a streamer of material a hundred thousand light-years
long out of IC 2163. If you lived on a planet orbiting a star
within this streamer, you would have a magnificent view of
both galaxies. NGC 2207 and IC 2163 are respectively
143,000 light-years and 101,000 light-years in diameter. Both
galaxies are 114 million light-years away in the constellation
Canis Major. (NASA and the Hubble Heritage Team, AURA/STScI)

and this is the side that we see. For the same reason, most of the
satellites in the solar system are in synchronous rotation, and thus
always keep the same side facing their planet.
Tidal forces are also important on scales much larger than
the solar system. Figure 4-27 shows two spiral galaxies, like the
one in Figure 1-7, undergoing a near-collision. During the millions of years that this close encounter has been taking place, the
tidal forces of the larger galaxy have pulled an immense streamer
of stars and interstellar gas out of the smaller galaxy.
Many galaxies, including our own Milky Way Galaxy, show
signs of having been disturbed at some time by tidal interactions
with other galaxies. By their effect on the interstellar gas from
which stars are formed, tidal interactions can actually trigger the
birth of new stars. Our own Sun and solar system may have been
formed as a result of tidal interactions of this kind. Hence, we
may owe our very existence to tidal forces. In this and many other
ways, the laws of motion and of universal gravitation shape our
universe and our destinies.

Key Ideas
Apparent Motions of the Planets: Like the Sun and Moon, the
planets move on the celestial sphere with respect to the back-

91

ground of stars. Most of the time a planet moves eastward in direct motion, in the same direction as the Sun and the Moon, but
from time to time it moves westward in retrograde motion.
The Ancient Geocentric Model: Ancient astronomers believed the
Earth to be at the center of the universe. They invented a complex system of epicycles and deferents to explain the direct and
retrograde motions of the planets on the celestial sphere.
Copernicus’s Heliocentric Model: Copernicus’s heliocentric (Suncentered) theory simplified the general explanation of planetary
motions.
• In a heliocentric system, the Earth is one of the planets orbiting
the Sun.
• A planet undergoes retrograde motion as seen from Earth when
the Earth and the planet pass each other.
• The sidereal period of a planet, its true orbital period, is measured with respect to the stars. Its synodic period is measured with
respect to the Earth and the Sun (for example, from one opposition to the next).
Kepler’s Improved Heliocentric Model and Elliptical Orbits:
Copernicus thought that the orbits of the planets were combinations of circles. Using data collected by Tycho Brahe, Kepler deduced three laws of planetary motion: (1) the orbits are in fact
ellipses; (2) a planet’s speed varies as it moves around its elliptical orbit; and (3) the orbital period of a planet is related to the
size of its orbit.
Evidence for the Heliocentric Model: The invention of the telescope led Galileo to new discoveries that supported a heliocentric
model. These included his observations of the phases of Venus
and of the motions of four moons around Jupiter.
Newton’s Laws of Motion: Isaac Newton developed three principles, called the laws of motion, that apply to the motions of objects on Earth as well as in space. These are (1) the tendency of
an object to maintain a constant velocity, (2) the relationship between the net outside force on an object and the object’s acceleration, and (3) the principle of action and reaction. These laws and
Newton’s law of universal gravitation can be used to deduce
Kepler’s laws. They lead to extremely accurate descriptions of
planetary motions.
• The mass of an object is a measure of the amount of matter in
the object. Its weight is a measure of the force with which the
gravity of some other object pulls on it.
• In general, the path of one object about another, such as that
of a planet or comet about the Sun, is one of the curves called
conic sections: circle, ellipse, parabola, or hyperbola.
Tidal Forces: Tidal forces are caused by differences in the gravitational pull that one object exerts on different parts of a second
object.
• The tidal forces of the Moon and Sun produce tides in the
Earth’s oceans.
• The tidal forces of the Earth have locked the Moon into synchronous rotation.

The Nature
of Light
n the early 1800s, the French philosopher Auguste Comte argued that because the stars are so far away, humanity would
never know their nature and composition. But the means to
learn about the stars was already there for anyone to see—
starlight. Just a few years after Comte’s bold pronouncement, scientists began analyzing starlight to learn the very things that he
had deemed unknowable.
We now know that atoms of each chemical element emit and
absorb light at a unique set of wavelengths characteristic of that
element alone. The red light in the accompanying image of a gas
cloud in space is of a wavelength emitted by nitrogen and no
other element; the particular green light in this image is unique to
oxygen, and the particular blue light is unique to helium. The
light from nearby planets, distant stars, and remote galaxies also
has characteristic “fingerprints” that reveal the chemical composition of these celestial objects.
In this chapter we learn about the basic properties of light.
Light has a dual nature: it has the properties of both waves and
particles. The light emitted by an object depends upon the object’s
temperature; we can use this to determine the surface temperatures of stars. By studying the structure of atoms, we will learn
why each element emits and absorbs light only at specific wavelengths and will see how astronomers determine what the atmospheres of planets and stars are made of. The motion of a light
source also affects wavelengths, permitting us to deduce how fast
stars and other objects are approaching or receding. These are but
a few of the reasons why understanding light is a prerequisite to
understanding the universe.

5-1 Light travels through empty space at a
speed of 300,000 km/s
Galileo Galilei and Isaac Newton were among the first to ask basic questions about light. Does light travel instantaneously from
one place to another, or does it move with a measurable speed?
Whatever the nature of light, it does seem to travel swiftly from
a source to our eyes. We see a distant event before we hear the
accompanying sound. (For example, we see a flash of lightning
before we hear the thunderclap.)
In the early 1600s, Galileo tried The speed of light in a

his lantern; as soon as his assistant saw the flash of light, he
opened his own. Galileo used his pulse as a timer to try to measure the time between opening his lantern and seeing the light from
his assistant’s lantern. From the distance and time, he hoped to
compute the speed at which the light had traveled to the distant
hilltop and back.
Galileo found that the measured time failed to increase noticeably, no matter how distant the assistant was stationed. Galileo
therefore concluded that the speed of light is too high to be measured by slow human reactions. Thus, he was unable to tell whether
or not light travels instantaneously.

The Speed of Light: Astronomical Measurements
The first evidence that light does not travel instantaneously was
presented in 1676 by Olaus Rømer, a Danish astronomer. Rømer
had been studying the orbits of the moons of Jupiter by carefully
timing the moments when they passed into or out of Jupiter’s
shadow. To Rømer’s surprise, the timing of these eclipses of
Jupiter’s moons seemed to depend on the relative positions of
Jupiter and the Earth. When the Earth was far from Jupiter (that
is, near conjunction; see Figure 4-6), the eclipses occurred several
minutes later than when the Earth was close to Jupiter (near
opposition).
Rømer realized that this puzzling effect could be explained if
light needs time to travel from Jupiter to the Earth. When the
Earth is closest to Jupiter, the image of a satellite disappearing
into Jupiter’s shadow arrives at our telescopes a little sooner than
it does when Jupiter and the Earth are farther apart (Figure 5-1).
The range of variation in the times at which such eclipses are observed is about 16.6 minutes, which Rømer interpreted as the
length of time required for light to travel across the diameter of
the Earth’s orbit (a distance of 2 AU). The size of the Earth’s orbit was not accurately known in Rømer’s day, and he never actually calculated the speed of light. Today, using the modern
value of 150 million kilometers for the astronomical unit, Rømer’s

The Fizeau-Foucault Method of Measuring the Speed of Light Light
from a light source (1) is reflected off a rotating mirror to a stationary

reaches the observer (4) is deflected away from the path of the initial
beam because the rotating mirror has moved slightly while the light was
making the round trip. The speed of light is calculated from the deflection
angle and the dimensions of the apparatus.

method yields a value for the speed of light equal to roughly
300,000 km/s (186,000 mi/s).

The Speed of Light: Measurements on Earth
Almost two centuries after Rømer, the speed of light was measured very precisely in an experiment carried out on Earth. In
1850, the French physicists Armand-Hippolyte Fizeau and Jean
Foucault built the apparatus sketched in Figure 5-2. Light from a
light source reflects from a rotating mirror toward a stationary
mirror 20 meters away. The rotating mirror moves slightly while
the light is making the round trip, so the returning light ray is deflected away from the source by a small angle. By measuring this
angle and knowing the dimensions of their apparatus, Fizeau and
Foucault could deduce the speed of light. Once again, the answer
was very nearly 300,000 km/s.
The speed of light in a vacuum is usually designated by the
letter c (from the Latin celeritas, meaning “speed”). The modern
value is c ⫽ 299,792.458 km/s (186,282.397 mi/s). In most calculations you can use

Figure 5-1
Rømer’s Proof That Light Does Not Travel Instantaneously The
timing of eclipses of Jupiter’s moons as seen from Earth depends on the
Earth-Jupiter distance. Rømer correctly attributed this effect to variations
in the time required for light to travel from Jupiter to the Earth.

The most convenient set of units to use for c is different in
different situations. The value in kilometers per second (km/s) is
often most useful when comparing c to the speeds of objects in
space, while the value in meters per second (m/s) is preferred
when doing calculations involving the wave nature of light (which
we will discuss in Section 5-2).

CAUTION! Note that the quantity c is the speed of light in a
vacuum. Light travels more slowly through air, water, glass, or
any other transparent substance than it does in a vacuum. In our
study of astronomy, however, we will almost always consider
light traveling through the vacuum (or near-vacuum) of space.
The speed of light in empty space is one of the most important numbers in modern physical science. This value appears in
many equations that describe atoms, gravity, electricity, and mag-

Until Newton’s time, it was thought that a prism somehow added colors to white light. To test this idea, Newton placed a second prism so that just one color of the
spectrum passed through it (Figure 5-4). According to the old theory, this should have caused a further change in the color of the
light. But Newton found that each color of the spectrum was unchanged by the second prism; red remained red, blue remained

5-2 Light is electromagnetic radiation and is
characterized by its wavelength

The first major breakthrough in understanding light came from a
simple experiment performed by Isaac Newton around 1670.
Newton was familiar with what he called the “celebrated Phenomenon of Colours,” in which a beam of sunlight passing
through a glass prism spreads out into the colors of the rainbow
(Figure 5-3). This rainbow is called a spectrum (plural spectra).

Figure 5-4
Newton’s Experiment on the Nature of Light In a crucial experiment,
Newton took sunlight that had passed through a prism and sent it
through a second prism. Between the two prisms was a screen with a
hole in it that allowed only one color of the spectrum to pass through.
This same color emerged from the second prism. Newton’s experiment

proved that prisms do not add color to light but merely bend different
colors through different angles. It also proved that white light, such as
sunlight, is actually a combination of all the colors that appear in its
spectrum.

blue, and so on. He concluded that a prism merely separates colors and does not add color. Hence, the spectrum produced by the
first prism shows that sunlight is a mixture of all the colors of the
rainbow.
Newton suggested that light is composed of particles too
small to detect individually. In 1678, however, the Dutch physicist and astronomer Christiaan Huygens proposed a rival explanation. He suggested that light travels in the form of waves rather
than particles.

Young and the Wave Nature of Light
Around 1801, Thomas Young in England carried out an experiment that convincingly demonstrated the wavelike aspect of light.
He passed a beam of light through two thin, parallel slits in an
opaque screen, as shown in Figure 5-5a. On a white surface some
distance beyond the slits, the light formed a pattern of alternating bright and dark bands. Young reasoned that if a beam of light
was a stream of particles (as Newton had suggested), the two
beams of light from the slits should simply form bright images of
the slits on the white surface. The pattern of bright and dark
bands he observed is just what would be expected, however, if
light had wavelike properties. An analogy with water waves
demonstrates why.

ANALOGY Imagine ocean waves pounding against a reef or
breakwater that has two openings (Figure 5-5b). A pattern of
ripples is formed on the other side of the barrier as the waves
come through the two openings and interfere with each other.
At certain points, wave crests arrive simultaneously from the
two openings. These reinforce each other and produce high
waves. At other points, a crest from one opening meets a trough
from the other opening. These cancel each other out, leaving
areas of still water. This process of combining two waves also
takes place in Young’s double-slit experiment: The bright bands
are regions where waves from the two slits reinforce each other,
while the dark bands appear where waves from the two slits
cancel each other.

Maxwell and Light as an Electromagnetic Wave
The discovery of the wave nature of light posed some obvious
questions. What exactly is “waving” in light? That is, what is it
about light that goes up and down like water waves on the ocean?
Because we can see light from the Sun, planets, and stars, light
waves must be able to travel across empty space. Hence, whatever
is “waving” cannot be any material substance. What, then, is it?
The answer came from a seemingly unlikely source—a comprehensive theory that described electricity and magnetism. Numerous experiments during the first half of the nineteenth century
demonstrated an intimate connection between electric and magnetic forces. A central idea to emerge from these experiments is
the concept of a field, an immaterial yet measurable disturbance
of any region of space in which electric or magnetic forces are felt.
Thus, an electric charge is surrounded by an electric field, and a
magnet is surrounded by a magnetic field. Experiments in the
early 1800s demonstrated that moving an electric charge produces a magnetic field; conversely, moving a magnet gives rise to
an electric field.

experiment with water waves in a small tank.) In certain locations, wave
crests from both openings reinforce each other to produce extra high
waves. At other locations a crest from one opening meets a trough from
the other. The crest and trough cancel each other, producing still water.

In the 1860s, the Scottish mathematician and physicist James
Clerk Maxwell succeeded in describing all the basic properties of
electricity and magnetism in four equations. This mathematical
achievement demonstrated that electric and magnetic forces are
really two aspects of the same phenomenon, which we now call
electromagnetism.
By combining his four equations, Maxwell showed that electric and magnetic fields should travel through space in the form
of waves at a speed of 3.0 ⫻ 105 km/s—a value exactly equal to
the best available value for the speed of light. Maxwell’s sugges-

tion that these waves do exist and are observed as light was soon
confirmed by experiments. Because of its electric and magnetic
properties, light is also called electromagnetic radiation.

CAUTION! You may associate the term radiation with radioactive materials like uranium, but this term refers to anything that
radiates, or spreads away, from its source. For example, scientists sometimes refer to sound waves as “acoustic radiation.”
Radiation does not have to be related to radioactivity!
Electromagnetic radiation consists of oscillating electric and
magnetic fields, as shown in Figure 5-6. The distance between
two successive wave crests is called the wavelength of the light,
usually designated by the Greek letter ␭ (lambda). No matter
what the wavelength, electromagnetic radiation always travels at
the same speed c ⫽ 3.0 ⫻ 105 km/s ⫽ 3.0 ⫻ 108 m/s in a vacuum.
More than a century elapsed between Newton’s experiments
with a prism and the confirmation of the wave nature of light.
One reason for this delay is that visible light, the light to which
the human eye is sensitive, has extremely short wavelengths—less
than a thousandth of a millimeter—that are not easily detectable.
To express such tiny distances conveniently, scientists use a unit
of length called the nanometer (abbreviated nm), where 1 nm ⫽
10⫺9 m. Experiments demonstrated that visible light has wavelengths covering the range from about 400 nm for violet light to
about 700 nm for red light. Intermediate colors of the rainbow
like yellow (550 nm) have intermediate wavelengths, as shown in
Figure 5-7. (Some astronomers prefer to measure wavelengths in
angstroms. One angstrom, abbreviated Å, is one-tenth of a nanometer: 1 Å ⫽ 0.1 nm ⫽ 10⫺10 m. In these units, the wavelengths
of visible light extend from about 4000 Å to about 7000 Å. We
will not use these units in this book, however.)

of energy. This invisible energy, now called infrared radiation,
was later realized to be electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths somewhat longer than those of visible light.
In experiments with electric sparks in 1888, the German
physicist Heinrich Hertz succeeded in producing electromagnetic
radiation with even longer wavelengths of a few centimeters or
more. These are now known as radio waves. In 1895 another
German physicist, Wilhelm Röntgen, invented a machine that
produces electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths shorter than

Maxwell’s equations place no restrictions on the wavelength of
electromagnetic radiation. Hence, electromagnetic waves could
and should exist with wavelengths both longer and shorter than
the 400–700 nm range of visible light. Consequently, researchers
began to look for invisible forms of light. These are forms of electromagnetic radiation to which the cells of the human retina do
not respond.
The first kind of invisible radiation to be discovered actually
preceded Maxwell’s work by more than a half century. Around
1800 the British astronomer William Herschel passed sunlight
through a prism and held a thermometer just beyond the red end
of the visible spectrum. The thermometer registered a temperature
increase, indicating that it was being exposed to an invisible form

of electromagnetic radiation is called the electromagnetic

medical and dental offices are direct descendants of Röntgen’s invention. Over the years radiation has been discovered with many
other wavelengths.
Thus, visible light occupies only a tiny fraction of the full
range of possible wavelengths, collectively called the electromagnetic spectrum. As Figure 5-7 shows, the electromagnetic spectrum stretches from the longest-wavelength radio waves to the
shortest-wavelength gamma rays. Figure 5-8 shows some applications of nonvisible light in modern technology.
On the long-wavelength side of the visible spectrum, infrared
radiation covers the range from about 700 nm to 1 mm. Astronomers interested in infrared radiation often express wavelength in micrometers or microns, abbreviated ␮m, where 1 ␮m ⫽
10⫺3 mm ⫽ 10⫺6 m. Microwaves have wavelengths from roughly
1 mm to 10 cm, while radio waves have even longer wavelengths.
At wavelengths shorter than those of visible light, ultraviolet
radiation extends from about 400 nm down to 10 nm. Next are
X rays, which have wavelengths between about 10 and 0.01 nm,
and beyond them at even shorter wavelengths are gamma rays.
Note that the rough boundaries between different types of radiation are simply arbitrary divisions in the electromagnetic spectrum.

first produced radio waves. For example, if 500 crests of a wave
pass you in one second, the frequency of the wave is 500 cycles
per second or 500 Hz.
In working with frequencies, it is often convenient to use the
prefix mega- (meaning “million,” or 106, and abbreviated M) or
kilo- (meaning “thousand,” or 103, and abbreviated k). For example, AM radio stations broadcast at frequencies between 535
and 1605 kHz (kilohertz), while FM radio stations broadcast at
frequencies in the range from 88 to 108 MHz (megahertz).
The relationship between the frequency and wavelength of an
electromagnetic wave is a simple one. Because light moves at a
constant speed c ⫽ 3 ⫻ 108 m/s, if the wavelength (distance from
one crest to the next) is made shorter, the frequency must increase
(more of those closely spaced crests pass you each second). Mathematically, the frequency ␯ of light is related to its wavelength ␭

Frequency and Wavelength
Astronomers who work with radio telescopes often prefer to
speak of frequency rather than wavelength. The frequency of a
wave is the number of wave crests that pass a given point in one
second. Equivalently, it is the number of complete cycles of the
wave that pass per second (a complete cycle is from one crest to
the next). Frequency is usually denoted by the Greek letter ␯ (nu).
The unit of frequency is the cycle per second, also called the hertz
(abbreviated Hz) in honor of Heinrich Hertz, the physicist who

5-3 An opaque object emits electromagnetic
radiation according to its temperature
To learn about objects in the heavens, astronomers study the
character of the electromagnetic radiation coming from those objects. Such studies can be very revealing because different kinds
of electromagnetic radiation are typically produced in different
ways. As an example, on Earth the
most common way to generate radio As an object is heated, it

oscillate back and forth (as is done

produced by bombarding atoms in a piece of metal with fastmoving particles extracted from within other atoms. Our own
Sun emits radio waves from near its glowing surface and X rays

Figure 5-9

from its corona (see the photo that opens Chapter 3). Hence,
these observations indicate the presence of electric currents near
the Sun’s surface and of fast-moving particles in the Sun’s outermost regions. (We will discuss the Sun at length in Chapter 18.)

Radiation from Heated Objects

Visible light has a much shorter wavelength and higher frequency than radio waves. You can use the above formula to show
that for yellow-orange light of wavelength 600 nm, the frequency
is 5 ⫻ 1014 Hz or 500 million megahertz!
While Young’s experiment (Figure 5-5) showed convincingly
that light has wavelike aspects, it was discovered in the early
1900s that light also has some of the characteristics of a stream
of particles and waves. We will explore light’s dual nature in
Section 5-5.

(a) Hot: glows deep red

103

(b) Hotter: glows orange

The simplest and most common way to produce electromagnetic
radiation, either on or off the Earth, is to heat an object. The hot
filament of wire inside an ordinary lightbulb emits white light,
and a neon sign has a characteristic red glow because neon gas
within the tube is heated by an electric current. In like fashion,
almost all the visible light that we receive from space comes from
hot objects like the Sun and the stars. The kind and amount of
light emitted by a hot object tell us not only how hot it is but also
about other properties of the object.
We can tell whether the hot object is made of relatively dense
or relatively thin material. Consider the difference between a
lightbulb and a neon sign. The dense, solid filament of a lightbulb
makes white light, which is a mixture of all different visible wavelengths, while the thin, transparent neon gas produces light of a
rather definite red color and, hence, a rather definite wavelength.
For now we will concentrate our attention on the light produced
by dense, opaque objects. (We will return to the light produced by
gases in Section 5-6.) Even though the Sun and stars are gaseous,
not solid, it turns out that they emit light with many of the same
properties as light emitted by a hot, glowing, solid object.
Imagine a welder or blacksmith heating a bar of iron. As the
bar becomes hot, it begins to glow deep red, as shown in Figure
5-9a. (You can see this same glow from the coils of a toaster or
from an electric range turned on “high.”) As the temperature rises
further, the bar begins to give off a brighter orange light (Figure
5-9b). At still higher temperatures, it shines with a brilliant yellow light (Figure 5-9c). If the bar could be prevented from melting and vaporizing, at extremely high temperatures it would emit
a dazzling blue-white light.

(c) Even hotter: glows yellow

RI V UXG

Heating a Bar of Iron This sequence of photographs shows how the
appearance of a heated bar of iron changes with temperature. As the
temperature increases, the bar glows more brightly because it radiates

more energy. The color of the bar also changes because as the
temperature goes up, the dominant wavelength of light emitted by the
bar decreases. (©1984 Richard Megna/Fundamental Photographs)

Chapter 5

If something is hot, its atoms are moving at high speeds; if it
is cold, its atoms are moving slowly. Scientists usually prefer to
use the Kelvin temperature scale, on which temperature is measured in kelvins (K) upward from absolute zero. This is the coldest possible temperature, at which atoms move as slowly as
possible (they can never quite stop completely). On the more familiar Celsius and Fahrenheit temperature scales, absolute zero
(0 K) is ⫺273°C and ⫺460°F. Ordinary room temperature is
293 K, 20°C, or 68°F. Box 5-1 discusses the relationships among
the Kelvin, Celsius, and Fahrenheit temperature scales.
Figure 5-11 depicts quantitatively how the radiation from a
dense object depends on its Kelvin temperature. Each curve in this
figure shows the intensity of light emitted at each wavelength by
a dense object at a given temperature: 3000 K (the temperature
at which molten gold boils), 6000K (the temperature of an ironwelding arc), and 12,000 K (a temperature found in special industrial furnaces). In other words, the curves show the spectrum
of light emitted by such an object. At any temperature, a hot,
dense object emits at all wavelengths, so its spectrum is a smooth,
continuous curve with no gaps in it.

The higher the temperature of a blackbody, the
shorter the wavelength of maximum emission
(the wavelength at which the curve peaks).

An Infrared Portrait In this image made with a camera sensitive to
infrared radiation, the different colors represent regions of different
temperature. Red areas (like the man’s face) are the warmest and emit
the most infrared light, while blue-green areas (including the man’s hands
and hair) are at the lowest temperatures and emit the least radiation. (Dr.
Arthur Tucker/Photo Researchers)

The higher the temperature
of a blackbody, the more light
is emitted at all wavelengths.
Intensity

As this example shows, the amount of energy emitted by the
hot, dense object and the dominant wavelength of the emitted radiation both depend on the temperature of the object. The hotter
the object, the more energy it emits and the shorter the wavelength at which most of the energy is emitted. Colder objects
emit relatively little energy, and this emission is primarily at long
wavelengths.
These observations explain why you can’t see in the dark.
The temperatures of people, animals, and furniture are rather less
than even that of the iron bar in Figure 5-9a. So, while these objects emit radiation even in a darkened room, most of this emission is at wavelengths greater than those of red light, in the
infrared part of the spectrum (see Figure 5-7). Your eye is not sensitive to infrared, and you thus cannot see ordinary objects in a
darkened room. But you can detect this radiation by using a camera that is sensitive to infrared light (Figure 5-10).
To better understand the relationship between the temperature of a dense object and the radiation it emits, it is helpful to
know just what “temperature” means. The temperature of a substance is directly related to the average speed of the tiny atoms—
the building blocks that come in distinct forms for each distinct
chemical element—that make up the substance. (Typical atoms
are about 10⫺10 m ⫽ 0.1 nm in diameter, or about 1/5000 as
large as a typical wavelength of visible light.)

hree temperature scales are in common use.
Throughout most of the world, temperatures are
T
expressed in degrees Celsius (°C). The Celsius tem-

perature scale is based on the behavior of water, which freezes
at 0°C and boils at 100°C at sea level on Earth. This scale is
named after the Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius, who proposed it in 1742.
Astronomers usually prefer the Kelvin temperature
scale. This is named after the nineteenth-century British
physicist Lord Kelvin, who made many important contributions to our understanding of heat and temperature. Absolute zero, the temperature at which atomic motion is at
the absolute minimum, is –273°C in the Celsius scale but
0 K in the Kelvin scale. Atomic motion cannot be any less
than the minimum, so nothing can be colder than 0 K;
hence, there are no negative temperatures on the Kelvin
scale. Note that we do not use degree (°) with the Kelvin
temperature scale.
A temperature expressed in kelvins is always equal to the
temperature in degrees Celsius plus 273. On the Kelvin scale,
water freezes at 273 K and boils at 373 K. Water must be
heated through a change of 100 K or 100°C to go from its
freezing point to its boiling point. Thus, the “size” of a kelvin
is the same as the “size” of a Celsius degree. When considering temperature changes, measurements in kelvins and Celsius
degrees are the same. For extremely high temperatures the
Kelvin and Celsius scales are essentially the same: for example,
the Sun’s core temperature is either 1.55 ⫻ 107 K or 1.55 ⫻
107 °C.
The now-archaic Fahrenheit scale, which expresses temperature in degrees Fahrenheit (°F), is used only in the
United States. When the German physicist Gabriel Fahrenheit introduced this scale in the early 1700s, he intended
100°F to represent the temperature of a healthy human
body. On the Fahrenheit scale, water freezes at 32°F and
boils at 212°F. There are 180 Fahrenheit degrees between
the freezing and boiling points of water, so a degree Fahrenheit is only 100/180 ⫽ 5/9 as large as either a Celsius degree or a kelvin.
Two simple equations allow you to convert a temperature
from the Celsius scale to the Fahrenheit scale and from Fahrenheit to Celsius:

The shape of the spectrum depends on temperature, however.
An object at relatively low temperature (say, 3000 K) has a low
curve, indicating a low intensity of radiation. The wavelength of
maximum emission, at which the curve has its peak and the emission of energy is strongest, is at a long wavelength. The higher the
temperature, the higher the curve (indicating greater intensity)
and the shorter the wavelength of maximum emission.

Figure 5-11 shows that for a dense object at a temperature of
3000 K, the wavelength of maximum emission is around 1000 nm
(1 ␮m). Because this is an infrared wavelength well outside the visible range, you might think that you cannot see the radiation from
an object at this temperature. In fact, the glow from such an object is visible; the curve shows that this object emits plenty of light
within the visible range, as well as at even shorter wavelengths.

Chapter 5

The 3000-K curve is quite a bit higher at the red end of the
visible spectrum than at the violet end, so a dense object at this
temperature will appear red in color. Similarly, the 12,000-K
curve has its wavelength of maximum emission in the ultraviolet
part of the spectrum, at a wavelength shorter than visible light.
But such a hot, dense object also emits copious amounts of visible light (much more than at 6000 K or 3000 K, for which the
curves are lower) and thus will have a very visible glow. The
curve for this temperature is higher for blue light than for red
light, and so the color of a dense object at 12,000 K is a brilliant
blue or blue-white. These conclusions agree with the color changes
of a heated rod shown in Figure 5-9. The same principles apply
to stars: A star that looks blue, such as Bellatrix in the constellation Orion (see Figure 2-2a), has a high surface temperature,
while a red star such as Betelgeuse (Figure 2-2a) has a relatively
cool surface.
These observations lead to a general rule:
The higher an object’s temperature, the more intensely the
object emits electromagnetic radiation and the shorter the
wavelength at which it emits most strongly.
We will make frequent use of this general rule to analyze the
temperatures of celestial objects such as planets and stars.
The curves in Figure 5-11 are drawn for an idealized type of
dense object called a blackbody. A perfect blackbody does not reflect any light at all; instead, it absorbs all radiation falling on it.
Because it reflects no electromagnetic radiation, the radiation that
it does emit is entirely the result of its temperature. Ordinary objects, like tables, textbooks, and people, are not perfect blackbodies; they reflect light, which is why they are visible. A star such as
the Sun, however, behaves very much like a perfect blackbody,
because it absorbs almost completely any radiation falling on it
from outside. The light emitted by a blackbody is called blackbody radiation, and the curves in Figure 5-11 are often called
blackbody curves.

CAUTION! Despite its name, a blackbody does not necessarily
look black. The Sun, for instance, does not look black because
its temperature is high (around 5800 K), and so it glows brightly.
But a room-temperature (around 300 K) blackbody would appear very black indeed. Even if it were as large as the Sun, it
would emit only about 1/100,000 as much energy. (Its blackbody curve is far too low to graph in Figure 5-11.) Furthermore,
most of this radiation would be at wavelengths that are too long
for our eyes to perceive.
Figure 5-12 shows the blackbody curve for a temperature of
5800 K. It also shows the intensity curve for light from the Sun,
as measured from above the Earth’s atmosphere. (This is necessary because the Earth’s atmosphere absorbs certain wavelengths.)
The peak of both curves is at a wavelength of about 500 nm, near
the middle of the visible spectrum. Note how closely the observed
intensity curve for the Sun matches the blackbody curve. This is
a strong indication that the temperature of the Sun’s glowing surface is about 5800 K—a temperature that we can measure across
a distance of 150 million kilometers! The close correlation between blackbody curves and the observed intensity curves for

The Sun as a Blackbody This graph shows that the intensity of sunlight
over a wide range of wavelengths (solid curve) is a remarkably close
match to the intensity of radiation coming from a blackbody at a
temperature of 5800 K (dashed curve). The measurements of the Sun’s
intensity were made above the Earth’s atmosphere (which absorbs and
scatters certain wavelengths of sunlight). It’s not surprising that the
range of visible wavelengths includes the peak of the Sun’s spectrum; the
human eye evolved to take advantage of the most plentiful light available.

most stars is a key reason why astronomers are interested in the
physics of blackbody radiation.
Blackbody radiation depends only on the temperature of the
object emitting the radiation, not on the chemical composition of
the object. The light emitted by molten gold at 2000 K is very
nearly the same as that emitted by molten lead at 2000 K. Therefore, it might seem that analyzing the light from the Sun or from
a star can tell astronomers the object’s temperature but not what
the star is made of. As Figure 5-12 shows, however, the intensity
curve for the Sun (a typical star) is not precisely that of a blackbody. We will see later in this chapter that the differences between
a star’s spectrum and that of a blackbody allow us to determine
the chemical composition of the star.

5-4 Wien’s law and the Stefan-Boltzmann
law are useful tools for analyzing glowing
objects like stars
The mathematical formula that describes the blackbody curves in
Figure 5-11 is a rather complicated one. But there are two simpler formulas for blackbody radiation that prove to be very useful in Two simple mathematical
many branches of astronomy. They formulas describing
are used by astronomers who inves- blackbodies are essential
tigate the stars as well as by those tools for studying the
who study the planets (which are universe
dense, relatively cool objects that
emit infrared radiation). One of these formulas relates the temperature of a blackbody to its wavelength of maximum emission,

The Nature of Light

and the other relates the temperature to the amount of energy that
the blackbody emits. These formulas, which we will use throughout this book, restate in precise mathematical terms the qualitative relationships that we described in Section 5-3.

Wien’s Law
Figure 5-11 shows that the higher the temperature (T) of a blackbody, the shorter its wavelength of maximum emission (␭max). In
1893 the German physicist Wilhelm Wien used ideas about both
heat and electromagnetism to make this relationship quantitative.
The formula that he derived, which today is called Wien’s law, is

According to Wien’s law, the wavelength of maximum
emission of a blackbody is inversely proportional to its
temperature in kelvins. In other words, if the temperature of the blackbody doubles, its wavelength of maximum
emission is halved, and vice versa. For example, Figure 5-11
shows blackbody curves for temperatures of 3000 K, 6000 K, and
12,000 K. From Wien’s law, a blackbody with a temperature of

part of the electromagnetic spectrum. At 12,000 K, or twice the
temperature, the blackbody has a wavelength of maximum emission half as great, or ␭max ⫽ 240 nm; this is in the ultraviolet. At
3000 K, just half our original temperature, the value of ␭max is
twice the original value—960 nm, which is an infrared wavelength. You can see that these wavelengths agree with the peaks
of the curves in Figure 5-11.

CAUTION! Remember that Wien’s law involves the wavelength
of maximum emission in meters. If you want to convert the
wavelength to nanometers, you must multiply the wavelength in
meters by (109 nm)/(1 m).
Wien’s law is very useful for determining the surface temperatures of stars. It is not necessary to know how far away the star
is, how large it is, or how much energy it radiates into space. All
we need to know is the dominant wavelength of the star’s electromagnetic radiation.

The Stefan-Boltzmann Law
The other useful formula for the radiation from a blackbody involves the total amount of energy the blackbody radiates at all
wavelengths. (By contrast, the curves in Figure 5-11 show how
much energy a blackbody radiates at each individual wavelength.)
Energy is usually measured in joules (J), named after the
nineteenth-century English physicist James Joule. A joule is the

107

amount of energy contained in the motion of a 2-kilogram mass
moving at a speed of 1 meter per second. The joule is a convenient unit of energy because it is closely related to the familiar watt
(W): 1 watt is 1 joule per second, or 1 W ⫽ 1 J/s ⫽ 1 J s⫺1. (The
superscript ⫺1 means you are dividing by that quantity.) For example, a 100-watt lightbulb uses energy at a rate of 100 joules
per second, or 100 J/s. The energy content of food is also often
measured in joules; in most of the world, diet soft drinks are labeled as “low joule” rather than “low calorie.”
The amount of energy emitted by a blackbody depends both
on its temperature and on its surface area. This makes sense: A
large burning log radiates much more heat than a burning match,
even though the temperatures are the same. To consider the effects of temperature alone, it is convenient to look at the amount
of energy emitted from each square meter of an object’s surface
in a second. This quantity is called the energy flux (F). Flux means
“rate of flow,” and thus F is a measure of how rapidly energy is
flowing out of the object. It is measured in joules per square meter per second, usually written as J/m2/s or J m⫺2 s⫺1. Alternatively, because 1 watt equals 1 joule per second, we can express
flux in watts per square meter (W/m2, or W m⫺2).
The nineteenth-century Irish physicist David Tyndall performed the first careful measurements of the amount of radiation
emitted by a blackbody. (He studied the light from a heated platinum wire, which behaves approximately like a blackbody.) By
analyzing Tyndall’s results, the Slovenian physicist Josef Stefan
deduced in 1879 that the flux from a blackbody is proportional
to the fourth power of the object’s temperature (measured in
kelvins). Five years after Stefan announced his law, Austrian
physicist Ludwig Boltzmann showed how it could be derived
mathematically from basic assumptions about atoms and molecules. For this reason, Stefan’s law is commonly known as
the Stefan-Boltzmann law. Written as an equation, the StefanBoltzmann law is
Stefan-Boltzmann law for a blackbody

F ⫽ energy flux, in joules per square meter of surface per

T ⫽ object’s temperature, in kelvins
The value of the constant ␴ (the Greek letter sigma) is known
from laboratory experiments.
The Stefan-Boltzmann law says that if you double the temperature of an object (for example, from 300 K to 600 K), then
the energy emitted from the object’s surface each second increases
by a factor of 24 ⫽ 16. If you increase the temperature by a factor of 10 (for example, from 300 K to 3000 K), the rate of energy emission increases by a factor of 104 ⫽ 10,000. Thus, a
chunk of iron at room temperature (around 300 K) emits very little electromagnetic radiation (and essentially no visible light), but
an iron bar heated to 3000 K glows quite intensely.
Box 5-2 gives several examples of applying Wien’s law and
the Stefan-Boltzmann law to typical astronomical problems.

EXAMPLE: Using detectors above the Earth’s atmosphere,
astronomers have measured the average flux of solar energy
arriving at Earth. This value, called the solar constant, is
equal to 1370 W m⫺2. Use this information to calculate the
Sun’s surface temperature. (This provides a check on our
result from the preceding example.)

Situation: The solar constant is the flux of sunlight as
measured at the Earth. We want to use the value of the solar
constant to calculate T䉺.

5-5 Light has properties of both
waves and particles
At the end of the nineteenth century, physicists mounted a valiant
effort to explain all the characteristics of blackbody radiation. To
this end they constructed theories based on Maxwell’s description
of light as electromagnetic waves. But all such theories failed to
explain the characteristic shapes of blackbody curves shown in
Figure 5-11.

The Photon Hypothesis
In 1900, however, the German physicist Max Planck discovered
that he could derive a formula that correctly described blackbody

Tools: It may seem that all we need is the Stefan-Boltzmann
law, which relates flux to surface temperature. However, the
quantity F in this law refers to the flux measured at the
Sun’s surface, not at the Earth. Hence, we will first need to
calculate F from the given information.
Answer: To determine the value of F, we first imagine a huge
sphere of radius 1 AU with the Sun at its center, as shown in
the figure. Each square meter of that sphere receives 1370
watts of power from the Sun, so the total energy radiated by
the Sun per second is equal to the solar constant multiplied
by the sphere’s surface area. The result, called the luminosity
of the Sun and denoted by the symbol L䉺, is L䉺 ⫽ 3.90 ⫻
1026 W. That is, in 1 second the Sun radiates 3.90 ⫻ 1026
joules of energy into space. Because we know the size of the
Sun, we can compute the energy flux (energy emitted per
square meter per second) at its surface. The radius of the Sun
is R䉺 ⫽ 6.96 ⫻ 108 m, and the Sun’s surface area is 4␲R䉺2.

curves if he made certain assumptions. In 1905 the great Germanborn physicist Albert Einstein realized that these assumptions implied a radical new view of the nature of light. One tenet of this
new view is that electromagnetic energy is emitted in discrete, particlelike packets, or light quanta (the The revolutionary photon
plural of quantum, from a Latin concept is necessary to
word meaning “how much”). The explain blackbody
second tenet is that the energy of radiation and the
each light quantum—today called a photoelectric effect
photon—is related to the wavelength
of light: the greater the wavelength,
the lower the energy of a photon associated with that wavelength.
Thus, a photon of red light (wavelength ␭ ⫽ 700 nm) has less en-

The Nature of Light

Therefore, its energy flux F䉺 is the Sun’s luminosity (total
energy emitted by the Sun per second) divided by the Sun’s
surface area (the number of square meters of surface):

Once we have the Sun’s energy flux F䉺 we can use the StefanBoltzmann law to find the Sun’s surface temperature T䉺:
T䉺4 ⫽ F䉺/␴ ⫽ 1.13 ⫻ 1015 K4
Taking the fourth root (the square root of the square root)
of this value, we find the surface temperature of the Sun to
be T䉺 ⫽ 5800 K.

Review: Our result for T䉺 agrees with the value we
computed in the previous example using Wien’s law. Notice
that the solar constant of 1370 W m⫺2 is very much less
than F䉺, the flux at the Sun’s surface. By the time the Sun’s
radiation reaches Earth, it is spread over a greatly increased
area.

EXAMPLE: Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky, has a
surface temperature of about 10,000 K. Find the wavelength
at which Sirius emits most intensely.

Review: Our result shows that Sirius emits light most
intensely in the ultraviolet. In the visible part of the
spectrum, it emits more blue light than red light (like the
curve for 12,000 K in Figure 5-11), so Sirius has a distinct
blue color.

EXAMPLE: How does the energy flux from Sirius compare to
the Sun’s energy flux?

Situation: To compare the energy fluxes from the two stars,
we want to find the ratio of the flux from Sirius to the flux
from the Sun.

Tools: We use the Stefan-Boltzmann law to find the flux
from Sirius and from the Sun, which from the preceding
examples have surface temperatures 10,000 K and 5800 K,
respectively.
Answer: For the Sun, the Stefan-Boltzmann law is F䉺 ⫽

␴T䉺4, and for Sirius we can likewise write F* ⫽ ␴T*4, where
the subscripts 䉺 and * refer to the Sun and Sirius,
respectively. If we divide one equation by the other to find
the ratio of fluxes, the Stefan-Boltzmann constants cancel out

Another phenomenon explained by the photon hypothesis is the photoelectric effect. In this effect, a metal
plate is illuminated by a light beam. If ultraviolet light
is used, tiny negatively charged particles called electrons are emitted from the metal plate. (We will see in Section 5-7 that the electron is one of the basic particles of the atom.) But if visible light

light has a dual personality; it behaves as a stream of particlelike
photons, but each photon has wavelike properties. In this sense,
the best answer to the question “Is light a wave or a stream of
particles?” is “Yes!”
It was soon realized that the photon hypothesis explains more
than just the detailed shape of blackbody curves. For example, it
explains why only ultraviolet light causes suntans and sunburns.
The reason is that tanning or burning involves a chemical reaction in the skin. High-energy, short-wavelength ultraviolet
photons can trigger these reactions, but the lower-energy, longerwavelength photons of visible light cannot. Similarly, normal
photographic film is sensitive to visible light but not to infrared
light; a long-wavelength infrared photon does not have enough

hence, its total energy output is more than 8.8 times that

Einstein explained this behavior by noting that a certain minimum amount of energy is required to remove
an electron from the metal plate. The energy of a

110

Chapter 5

short-wavelength ultraviolet photon is greater than this minimum
value, so an electron that absorbs a photon of ultraviolet light
will have enough energy to escape from the plate. But an electron
that absorbs a photon of visible light, with its longer wavelength
and lower energy, does not gain enough energy to escape and so
remains within the metal. Einstein and Planck both won Nobel
prizes for their contributions to understanding the nature of light.

The Energy of a Photon

(Box 5-3). This is why we ordinarily do not notice that light
comes in the form of photons; even a dim light source emits so
many photons per second that it seems to be radiating a continuous stream of energy.
The energies of photons are sometimes expressed in terms of
a small unit of energy called the electron volt (eV). One electron
volt is equal to 1.602 ⫻ 10⫺19 J, so a 633-nm photon has an energy of 1.96 eV. If energy is expressed in electron volts, Planck’s
constant is best expressed in electron volts multiplied by seconds,
abbreviated eV s:

Because the frequency ␯ of light is related to the wavelength

The value of the constant h in this equation, now called Planck’s

The units of h are joules multiplied by seconds, called “jouleseconds” and abbreviated J s.
Because the value of h is so tiny, a single photon carries a
very small amount of energy. For example, a photon of red light

The equations E ⫽ hc/␭ and E ⫽ h␯ are together called

particlelike property of light (the energy E of a photon) and a
wavelike property (the wavelength ␭ or frequency ␯).
The photon picture of light is essential for understanding the
detailed shapes of blackbody curves. As we will see, it also helps
to explain how and why the spectra of the Sun and stars differ
from those of perfect blackbodies.

As an example, the laser bar-code scanners used at stores
and supermarkets emit orange-red light of wavelength 633 nm.
To calculate the energy of a single photon of this light, we

This is such a large number that the laser beam seems like

The Nature of Light

5-6 Each chemical element produces its own
unique set of spectral lines
In 1814 the German master optician Joseph von Fraunhofer repeated the classic experiment of shining a beam of sunlight through
a prism (see Figure 5-3). But this time Fraunhofer subjected the
resulting rainbow-colored spectrum to intense magnification. To
his surprise, he discovered that the
solar spectrum contains hundreds of Spectroscopy is the key
fine, dark lines, now called spectral
to determining the
lines. By contrast, if the light from a
chemical composition of
perfect blackbody were sent through
a prism, it would produce a smooth, planets and stars
continuous spectrum with no dark
lines. Fraunhofer counted more than 600 dark lines in the Sun’s
spectrum; today we know of more than 30,000. The photograph
of the Sun’s spectrum in Figure 5-13 shows hundreds of these
spectral lines.

Spectral Analysis
Half a century later, chemists discovered that they could produce
spectral lines in the laboratory and use these spectral lines to analyze what kinds of atoms different substances are made of.
Chemists had long known that many substances emit distinctive
colors when sprinkled into a flame. To facilitate study of these
colors, around 1857 the German chemist Robert Bunsen invented
a gas burner (today called a Bunsen burner) that produces a clean
flame with no color of its own. Bunsen’s colleague, the Prussian-

The Kirchhoff-Bunsen Experiment In the mid-1850s, Gustav Kirchhoff
and Robert Bunsen discovered that when a chemical substance is heated
and vaporized, the spectrum of the emitted light exhibits a series of
bright spectral lines. They also found that each chemical element
produces its own characteristic pattern of spectral lines. (In an actual
laboratory experiment, lenses would be needed to focus the image of the
slit onto the screen.)

born physicist Gustav Kirchhoff, suggested that the colored light
produced by substances in a flame might best be studied by passing the light through a prism (Figure 5-14). The two scientists
promptly discovered that the spectrum from a flame consists of a
pattern of thin, bright spectral lines against a dark background.
The same kind of spectrum is produced by heated gases such as
neon or argon.
Kirchhoff and Bunsen then found that each chemical element
produces its own unique pattern of spectral lines. Thus was born
in 1859 the technique of spectral analysis, the identification of
chemical substances by their unique patterns of spectral lines.
A chemical element is a fundamental substance that cannot
be broken down into more basic chemicals. Some examples are
hydrogen, oxygen, carbon, iron, gold, and silver. After Kirchhoff
and Bunsen had recorded the prominent spectral lines of all the
then-known elements, they soon began to discover other spectral
lines in the spectra of vaporized mineral samples. In this way they
discovered elements whose presence had never before been suspected. In 1860, Kirchhoff and Bunsen found a new line in the
blue portion of the spectrum of a sample of mineral water. After
isolating the previously unknown element responsible for making
the line, they named it cesium (from the Latin caesium, “grayblue”). The next year, a new line in the red portion of the spectrum of a mineral sample led them to discover the element
rubidium (Latin rubidium, “red”).
Spectral analysis even allowed the discovery of new elements
outside Earth. During the solar eclipse of 1868, astronomers
found a new spectral line in light coming from the hot gases at
the upper surface of the Sun while the main body of the Sun was
hidden by the Moon. This line was attributed to a new element

The spectrum of the Sun, with its dark spectral lines superimposed on a bright background (see Figure 5-13), may seem to be
unrelated to the spectra of bright lines against a dark background
produced by substances in a flame (see Figure 5-14). But by the
early 1860s, Kirchhoff’s experiments had revealed a direct connection between these two types of spectra. His conclusions are
summarized in three important statements about spectra that are
today called Kirchhoff’s laws. These laws, which are illustrated in
Figure 5-16, are as follows:

a hot, dense gas produces a continuous spectrum—a complete

possibility: The light can simply bounce off the atoms or molecules that make up the gas, a phenomenon called light scattering. In other words, photons passing through a gas cloud can
miss the gas atoms altogether, be swallowed whole by the atoms
(absorption), or bounce off the atoms like billiard balls colliding (scattering). Box 5-4 describes how light scattering explains
the blue color of the sky and the red color of sunsets.

Kirchhoff’s laws imply that if a beam of white light is passed
through a gas, the atoms of the gas somehow extract light of very
specific wavelengths from the white light. Hence, an observer
who looks straight through the gas at the white-light source (the
blackbody in Figure 5-16) will receive light whose spectrum has
dark absorption lines superimposed on the continuous spectrum
of the white light. The gas atoms then radiate light of precisely
these same wavelengths in all directions. An observer at an oblique

toward the blackbody) will receive only this light radiated by the
gas cloud; the spectrum of this light is bright emission lines on a

was not discovered on Earth until 1895, when it was found in
gases obtained from a uranium mineral.
A sample of an element contains only a single type of atom;
carbon contains only carbon atoms, helium contains only helium
atoms, and so on. Atoms of the same or different elements can
combine to form molecules. For example, two hydrogen atoms
(symbol H) can combine with an oxygen atom (symbol O) to
form a water molecule (symbol H2O). Substances like water whose
molecules include atoms of different elements are called compounds. Just as each type of atom has its own unique spectrum,
so does each type of molecule. Figure 5-15 shows the spectra of
several types of atoms and molecules.

body (like a blackbody) emits a continuous spectrum of

of a cooler gas, the cloud absorbs light of certain
specific wavelengths, and the spectrum of light that
passes directly through the cloud has dark absorption
lines (spectrum b). The cloud does not retain all the
light energy that it absorbs but radiates it outward in
all directions. The spectrum of this reradiated light
contains bright emission lines (spectrum c) with exactly
the same wavelengths as the dark absorption lines in
spectrum b. The specific wavelengths observed depend
on the chemical composition of the cloud.

(c) Emission line spectrum
(atoms in gas cloud reemit
absorbed light energy at the
same wavelengths at which
they absorbed it)

For example, if sodium is placed in the flame of a Bunsen
burner in a darkened room, the flame will emit a characteristic
orange-yellow glow. (This same glow is produced if we use ordinary table salt, which is a compound of sodium and chlorine.) If
we pass the light from the flame through a prism, it displays an
emission line spectrum with two closely spaced spectral lines at
wavelengths of 588.99 and 589.59 nm, in the orange-yellow part
of the spectrum. We now turn on a lightbulb whose filament is
hotter than the flame and shine the bulb’s white light through the
flame. The spectrum of this light after it passes through the flame’s
sodium vapor is the continuous spectrum from the lightbulb, but
with two closely spaced dark lines at 588.99 and 589.59 nm.
Thus, the chemical composition of the gas is revealed by either
bright emission lines or dark absorption lines.

Spectroscopy
Spectroscopy is the systematic study of spectra and spectral lines.
Spectral lines are tremendously important in astronomy, because

they provide reliable evidence about the chemical composition of
distant objects. As an example, the spectrum of the Sun shown in
Figure 5-13 is an absorption line spectrum. The continuous spectrum comes from the hot surface of the Sun, which acts like a
blackbody. The dark absorption lines are caused by this light
passing through a cooler gas; this gas is the atmosphere that surrounds the Sun. Therefore, by identifying the spectral lines present in the solar spectrum, we can determine the chemical
composition of the Sun’s atmosphere.
Figure 5-17 shows both a portion of the Sun’s absorption line
spectrum and the emission line spectrum of iron vapor over the
same wavelength range. This pattern of bright spectral lines in the
lower spectrum is iron’s own distinctive “fingerprint,” which no
other substance can imitate. Because some absorption lines in the
Sun’s spectrum coincide with the iron lines, some vaporized iron
must exist in the Sun’s atmosphere.
Spectroscopy can also help us analyze gas clouds in space,
such as the nebula surrounding the star cluster NGC 346 shown

Light Scattering
ight scattering is the process whereby photons bounce off
particles in their path. These particles can be atoms, moleL
cules, or clumps of molecules. You are reading these words using photons from the Sun or a lamp that bounced off the
page—that is, were scattered by the particles that make up the
page.
An important fact about light scattering is that very small
particles—ones that are smaller than a wavelength of visible
light—are quite effective at scattering short-wavelength photons
of blue light, but less effective at scattering long-wavelength
photons of red light. This fact explains a number of phenomena that you can see here on Earth.
The light that comes from the daytime sky is sunlight that
has been scattered by the molecules that make up our atmosphere (see part a of the accompanying figure). Air molecules
are less than 1 nm across, far smaller than the wavelength of
visible light, so they scatter blue light more than red light—
which is why the sky looks blue. Smoke particles are also quite
small, which explains why the smoke from a cigarette or a fire
has a bluish color.
Distant mountains often appear blue thanks to sunlight
being scattered from the atmosphere between the mountains
and your eyes. (The Blue Ridge Mountains, which extend from
Pennsylvania to Georgia, and Australia’s Blue Mountains derive their names from this effect.) Sunglasses often have a red
or orange tint, which blocks out blue light. This cuts down on
the amount of scattered light from the sky reaching your eyes
and allows you to see distant objects more clearly.
Light scattering also explains why sunsets are red. The
light from the Sun contains photons of all visible wavelengths,
but as this light passes through our atmosphere the blue photons are scattered away from the straight-line path from the
Sun to your eye. Red photons undergo relatively little scattering, so the Sun always looks a bit redder than it really is. When
you look toward the setting sun, the sunlight that reaches your
eye has had to pass through a relatively thick layer of atmosphere (part b of the accompanying figure). Hence, a large
fraction of the blue light from the Sun has been scattered, and
the Sun appears quite red.
The same effect also applies to sunrises, but sunrises seldom look as red as sunsets do. The reason is that dust is lifted
into the atmosphere during the day by the wind (which is typically stronger in the daytime than at night), and dust particles
in the atmosphere help to scatter even more blue light.
If the small particles that scatter light are sufficiently concentrated, there will be almost as much scattering of red light
as of blue light, and the scattered light will appear white. This
explains the white color of clouds, fog, and haze, in which the

scattering particles are ice crystals or water droplets. Whole
milk looks white because of light scattering from tiny fat globules; nonfat milk has only a very few of these globules and so
has a slight bluish cast.
Light scattering has many applications to astronomy. For
example, it explains why very distant stars in our Galaxy appear surprisingly red. The reason is that there are tiny dust particles in the space between the stars, and this dust scatters blue
photons. By studying how much scattering takes place, astronomers have learned about the tenuous material that fills
interstellar space.

make chemical assays of objects that are almost inconceivably distant. Throughout this book we will see many examples of how
astronomers use Kirchhoff’s laws to determine the nature of celestial objects.
To make full use of Kirchhoff’s laws, it is helpful to understand why they work. Why does an atom absorb light of only particular wavelengths? And why does it then emit light of only these
same wavelengths? Maxwell’s theory of electromagnetism (see
Section 5-2) could not answer these questions. The answers did
not come until early in the twentieth century, when scientists began to discover the structure and properties of atoms.

Analyzing the Composition of a Distant Nebula The
glowing gas cloud in this Hubble Space Telescope image lies
210,000 light-years away in the constellation Tucana (the Toucan). Hot
stars within the nebula emit high-energy, ultraviolet photons, which are
absorbed by the surrounding gas and heat the gas to high temperature.
This heated gas produces light with an emission line spectrum. The
particular wavelength of red light emitted by the nebula is 656 nm,
characteristic of hydrogen gas. (NASA, ESA, and A. Nota, STScI/ESA)

in Figure 5-18. Such glowing clouds have emission line spectra,
because we see them against the black background of space. The
particular shade of red that dominates the color of this nebula is
due to an emission line at a wavelength near 656 nm. This is one
of the characteristic wavelengths emitted by hydrogen gas, so we
can conclude that this nebula contains hydrogen. More detailed
analyses of this kind show that hydrogen is the most common element in gaseous nebulae, and indeed in the universe as a whole.
The spectra of other nebulae, such as the Ring Nebula shown in
the image that opens this chapter, also reveal the presence of nitrogen, oxygen, helium, and other gases.
What is truly remarkable about spectroscopy is that it can determine chemical composition at any distance. The 656-nm red
light produced by a sample of heated hydrogen gas on Earth (the
bright red line in the hydrogen spectrum in Figure 5-15) is the
same as that observed coming from the nebula shown in Figure
5-18, located about 210,000 light-years away. By using the basic
principles outlined by Kirchhoff, astronomers have the tools to

The first important clue about the internal structure of atoms
came from an experiment conducted in 1910 by Ernest Rutherford, a gifted physicist from New Zealand. Rutherford and his
colleagues at the University of Manchester in England had been
investigating the recently discovered phenomenon of radioactivity. Certain radioactive elements, such as uranium and radium,
were known to emit particles of various types. One type, the alpha particle, has about the same
mass as a helium atom and is emit- To decode the

They directed a beam of these particles at a thin sheet of metal (Figure 5-19). Almost all the alpha
particles passed through the metal sheet with little or no deflection from their straight-line paths. To the surprise of the experimenters, however, an occasional alpha particle bounced back
from the metal sheet as though it had struck something quite
dense. Rutherford later remarked, “It was almost as incredible as

Occasionally an alpha particle rebounds (like A or B), indicating

Figure 5-20
Rutherford’s Model of the Atom Electrons orbit the atom’s nucleus,

tively charged protons. A proton and a neutron have almost the
same mass, 1.7 ⫻ 10⫺27 kg, and each has about 2000 times as
much mass as an electron (9.1 ⫻ 10⫺31 kg). In an ordinary atom
there are as many positive protons as there are negative electrons,
so the atom has no net electric charge. Because the mass of the
electron is so small, the mass of an atom is not much greater than
the mass of its nucleus. That is why an alpha particle has nearly
the same mass as an atom of helium.
While the solar system is held together by gravitational forces,
atoms are held together by electrical forces. The electric forces attracting the positively charged protons and the negatively charged
electrons keep the atom from coming apart. Box 5-5 on page 118
describes more about the connection between the structure of
atoms and the chemical and physical properties of substances
made of those atoms.
Rutherford’s experiments clarified the structure of the atom,
but they did not explain how these tiny particles within the atom
give rise to spectral lines. The task of reconciling Rutherford’s
atomic model with Kirchhoff’s laws of spectral analysis was undertaken by the young Danish physicist Niels Bohr, who joined
Rutherford’s group at Manchester in 1912.

which contains most of the atom’s mass. The nucleus contains two types
of particles, protons and neutrons.

The Nucleus of an Atom
Rutherford proposed a new model for the structure of an atom,
shown in Figure 5-20. According to this model, a massive, positively charged nucleus at the center of the atom is orbited by tiny,
negatively charged electrons. Rutherford concluded that at least
99.98% of the mass of an atom must be concentrated in its nucleus, whose diameter is only about 10⫺14 m. (The diameter of a
typical atom is far larger, about 10⫺10 m.)

ANALOGY To appreciate just how tiny the nucleus is, imagine

expanding an atom by a factor of 1012 to a diameter of 100 meters, about the length of a football field. To this scale, the nucleus would be just a centimeter across—no larger than your
thumbnail.

We know today that the nucleus of an atom contains two
types of particles, protons and neutrons. A proton has a positive
electric charge, equal and opposite to that of an electron. As its
name suggests, a neutron has no electric charge—it is electrically
neutral. As an example, an alpha particle (such as those Rutherford’s team used) is actually a nucleus of the helium atom, with
two protons and two neutrons. Protons and neutrons are held together in a nucleus by the so-called strong nuclear force, whose
great strength overcomes the electric repulsion between the posi-

came back and hit you.”
Rutherford concluded from this experiment that most of the
mass of an atom is concentrated in a compact, massive lump of
matter that occupies only a small part of the atom’s volume. Most
of the alpha particles pass freely through the nearly empty space
that makes up most of the atom, but a few particles happen to
strike the dense mass at the center of the atom and bounce back.

5-8 Spectral lines are produced when an
electron jumps from one energy level to
another within an atom

Hydrogen and the Balmer Series
The most common type of hydrogen atom consists of a single
electron and a single proton. Hydrogen atoms have a simple
visible-light spectrum consisting of a pattern of lines that begins
at a wavelength of 656.3 nm and ends at 364.6 nm. The first
spectral line is called H␣ (H-alpha), the second spectral line is
called H␤ (H-beta), the third is H␥ (H-gamma), and so forth.
(These are the bright lines in the spectrum of hydrogen shown in
Figure 5-15. The fainter lines between these appear when hydrogen atoms form into molecules.) The closer you get to the shortwavelength end of the spectrum at 364.6 nm, the more spectral
lines you see.
The regularity in this spectral pattern was described mathematically in 1885 by Johann Jakob Balmer, a Swiss schoolteacher.
The spectral lines of hydrogen at visible wavelengths are today
called Balmer lines, and the entire pattern from H␣ onward is
called the Balmer series. Eight Balmer lines are seen in the spectrum of the star shown in Figure 5-21. Stars in general, including

jumping between the n ⫽ 2 and n ⫽ 3 orbits of a hydrogen atom
as the atom absorbs or emits an H␣ photon.
When the electron jumps from one orbit to another, the energy of the photon that is emitted or absorbed equals the difference in energy between these two orbits. This energy difference,
and hence the photon energy, is the same whether the jump is
from a low orbit to a high orbit (Figure 5-23a) or from the high
orbit back to the low one (Figure 5-23b). According to Planck
and Einstein, if two photons have the same energy E, the relationship E ⫽ hc/␭ tells us that they must also have the same wavelength ␭. It follows that if an atom can emit photons of a given
energy and wavelength, it can also absorb photons of precisely
the same energy and wavelength. Thus, Bohr’s picture explains
Kirchhoff’s observation that atoms emit and absorb the same
wavelengths of light.
The Bohr picture also helps us visualize what happens to produce an emission line spectrum. When a gas is heated, its atoms
move around rapidly and can collide forcefully with each other.
These energetic collisions excite the atoms’ electrons into high
orbits. The electrons then cascade back down to the innermost

Bohr’s Model of Hydrogen
Bohr realized that to fully understand the structure of the hydrogen atom, he had to be able to derive Balmer’s formula using the
laws of physics. He first made the rather wild assumption that the
electron in a hydrogen atom can orbit the nucleus only in certain
specific orbits. (This was a significant break with the ideas of
Newton, in whose mechanics any orbit should be possible.) Figure 5-22 shows the four smallest of these Bohr orbits, labeled by
the numbers n ⫽ 1, n ⫽ 2, n ⫽ 3, and so on.
Although confined to one of these allowed orbits while circling the nucleus, an electron can jump from one Bohr orbit to
another. For an electron to do this, the hydrogen atom must gain
or lose a specific amount of energy. The atom must absorb energy for the electron to go from an inner to an outer orbit; the
atom must release energy for the electron to go from an outer to
an inner orbit. As an example, Figure 5-23 shows an electron

Atoms, the Periodic Table, and Isotopes
ach different chemical element is made of a specific type of atom. Each specific atom has a charE
acteristic number of protons in its nucleus. For

example, a hydrogen atom has 1 proton in its nucleus, an oxygen atom has 8 protons in its nucleus, and so on.
The number of protons in an atom’s nucleus is the atomic
number for that particular element. The chemical elements are
most conveniently listed in the form of a periodic table (shown
in the figure). Elements are arranged in the periodic table in
order of increasing atomic number. With only a few exceptions, this sequence also corresponds to increasing average
mass of the atoms of the elements. Thus, hydrogen (symbol
H), with atomic number 1, is the lightest element. Iron (symbol Fe) has atomic number 26 and is a relatively heavy
element.
All the elements listed in a single vertical column of the
periodic table have similar chemical properties. For example,
the elements in the far right column are all gases under the
conditions of temperature and pressure found at the Earth’s
surface, and they are all very reluctant to react chemically with
other elements.
In addition to nearly 100 naturally occurring elements, the
periodic table includes a number of artificially produced elements. Most of these elements are heavier than uranium (symbol U) and are highly radioactive, which means that they decay
into lighter elements within a short time of being created in
laboratory experiments. Scientists have succeeded in creating
only a few atoms of elements 104 and above.
The number of protons in the nucleus of an atom determines which element that atom is. Nevertheless, the same element may have different numbers of neutrons in its nucleus.
For example, oxygen (O) has atomic number 8, so every oxygen nucleus has exactly 8 protons. But oxygen nuclei can have
8, 9, or 10 neutrons. These three slightly different kinds of

oxygen are called isotopes. The isotope with 8 neutrons is by
far the most abundant variety. It is written as 16O, or oxygen16. The rarer isotopes with 9 and 10 neutrons are designated
as 17O and 18O, respectively.
The superscript that precedes the chemical symbol for an
element equals the total number of protons and neutrons in a
nucleus of that particular isotope. For example, a nucleus of
the most common isotope of iron, 56Fe or iron-56, contains a
total of 56 protons and neutrons. From the periodic table, the
atomic number of iron is 26, so every iron atom has 26 protons in its nucleus. Therefore, the number of neutrons in an
iron-56 nucleus is 56 ⫺ 26 ⫽ 30. (Most nuclei have more
neutrons than protons, especially in the case of the heaviest
elements.)
It is extremely difficult to distinguish chemically between
the various isotopes of a particular element. Ordinary chemical reactions involve only the electrons that orbit the atom,
never the neutrons buried in its nucleus. But there are small
differences in the wavelengths of the spectral lines for different
isotopes of the same element. For example, the spectral line
wavelengths of the hydrogen isotope 2H are about 0.03%
greater than the wavelengths for the most common hydrogen
isotope, 1H. Thus, different isotopes can be distinguished by
careful spectroscopic analysis.
Isotopes are important in astronomy for a variety of reasons. By measuring the relative amounts of different isotopes
of a given element in a Moon rock or meteorite, the age of that
sample can be determined. The mixture of isotopes left behind
when a star explodes into a supernova (see Section 1-3) tells
astronomers about the processes that led to the explosion. And
knowing the properties of different isotopes of hydrogen and
helium is crucial to understanding the nuclear reactions that
make the Sun shine. Look for these and other applications of
the idea of isotopes in later chapters.

possible orbit, emitting photons whose energies are equal to the
energy differences between different Bohr orbits. In this fashion,
a hot gas produces an emission line spectrum with a variety of
different wavelengths.
To produce an absorption line spectrum, begin with a relatively cool gas, so that the electrons in most of the atoms are in
inner, low-energy orbits. If a beam of light with a continuous
spectrum is shone through the gas, most wavelengths will pass
through undisturbed. Only those photons will be absorbed whose
energies are just right to excite an electron to an allowed outer
orbit. Hence, only certain wavelengths will be absorbed, and dark
lines will appear in the spectrum at those wavelengths.

Today’s view of the atom owes much to the Bohr model, but is
different in certain ways. The modern picture is based on quantum mechanics, a branch of physics developed during the 1920s
that deals with photons and subatomic particles. As a result of
this work, physicists no longer picture electrons as moving in specific orbits about the nucleus. Instead, electrons are now known
to have both particle and wave properties and are said to occupy
only certain energy levels in the atom.
An extremely useful way of displaying the structure of an
atom is with an energy-level diagram. Figure 5-25 shows such a
diagram for hydrogen. The lowest energy level, called the ground
state, corresponds to the n ⫽ 1 Bohr orbit. Higher energy levels,
called excited states, correspond to successively larger Bohr orbits.
An electron can jump from the ground state up to the n ⫽ 2
level if the atom absorbs a Lyman-alpha photon with a wavelength of 122 nm. Such a photon has energy E ⫽ hc/␭ ⫽ 10.2 eV
(electron volts; see Section 5-5). That’s why the energy level of
n ⫽ 2 is shown in Figure 5-25 as having an energy 10.2 eV above
that of the ground state (which is usually assigned a value of
0 eV). Similarly, the n ⫽ 3 level is 12.1 eV above the ground state,

(N ⫽ 2) and higher orbits (n ⫽ 3, 4, 5, and so on). Remarkably,
as part of his calculation Bohr was able to derive the value of the
Rydberg constant in terms of Planck’s constant, the speed of light,
and the mass and electric charge of the electron. This gave particular credence to his radical model.
Bohr’s formula also correctly predicts the wavelengths of
other series of spectral lines that occur at nonvisible wavelengths
(Figure 5-24). Using N ⫽ 1 gives the Lyman series, which is entirely in the ultraviolet. All the spectral lines in this series involve
electron transitions between the lowest Bohr orbit and all higher
orbits (n ⫽ 2, 3, 4, and so on). This pattern of spectral lines begins with L␣ (Lyman alpha) at 122 nm and converges on L⬁ at
91.2 nm. Using N ⫽ 3 gives a series of infrared wavelengths called
the Paschen series. This series, which involves transitions between
the third Bohr orbit and all higher orbits, begins with P␣ (Paschen
alpha) at 1875 nm and converges on P⬁ at 822 nm. Additional
series exist at still longer wavelengths.

Figure 5-25
Energy-Level Diagram of Hydrogen A convenient way to display the
structure of the hydrogen atom is in a diagram like this, which shows the
allowed energy levels. The diagram shows a number of possible electron
jumps, or transitions, between energy levels. An upward transition occurs
when the atom absorbs a photon; a downward transition occurs when the
atom emits a photon. (Compare with Figure 5-24.)

The Nature of Light

length of 91.2 nm, equal to the shortest wavelength in the ultraviolet Lyman series (L⬁). So any photon with a wavelength
of 91.2 nm or less can ionize hydrogen. (The Planck formula
E ⫽ hc/␭ tells us that the higher the photon energy, the shorter
the wavelength.)
As an example, the gaseous nebula shown in Figure 5-18 surrounds a cluster of hot stars which produce copious amounts of
ultraviolet photons with wavelengths less than 91.2 nm. Hydrogen atoms in the nebula that absorb these photons become ionized and lose their electrons. When the electrons recombine with
the nuclei, they cascade down the energy levels to the ground
state and emit visible light in the process. This is what makes the
nebula glow.

The same basic principles that explain the hydrogen
spectrum also apply to the atoms of other elements.
Electrons in each kind of atom can be only in certain
energy levels, so only photons of certain wavelengths can be emitted or absorbed. Because each kind of atom has its own unique
arrangement of electron levels, the pattern of spectral lines is likewise unique to that particular type of atom (see the photograph
that opens this chapter). These patterns are in general much more
complicated than for the hydrogen atom. Hence, there is no simple relationship analogous to the Bohr formula that applies to the
spectra of all atoms.
The idea of energy levels explains the emission line spectra
and absorption line spectra of gases. But what about the continuous spectra produced by dense objects like the filament of a
lightbulb or the coils of a toaster? These objects are made of
atoms, so why don’t they emit light with an emission line spectrum characteristic of the particular atoms of which they are
made?
The reason is directly related to the difference between a gas
on the one hand and a liquid or solid on the other. In a gas, atoms
are widely separated and can emit photons without interference
from other atoms. But in a liquid or a solid, atoms are so close
that they almost touch, and thus these atoms interact strongly
with each other. These interactions interfere with the process of
emitting photons. As a result, the pattern of distinctive bright
spectral lines that the atoms would emit in isolation becomes
“smeared out” into a continuous spectrum.

ANALOGY Think of atoms as being like tuning forks. If you
strike a single tuning fork, it produces a sound wave with a single clear frequency and wavelength, just as an isolated atom
emits light of definite wavelengths. But if you shake a box
packed full of tuning forks, you will hear a clanging noise that
is a mixture of sounds of all different frequencies and wavelengths. This is directly analogous to the continuous spectrum
of light emitted by a dense object with closely packed atoms.
With the work of such people as Planck, Einstein, Rutherford,
and Bohr, the interchange between astronomy and physics came
full circle. Modern physics was born when Newton set out to understand the motions of the planets. Two and a half centuries
later, physicists in their laboratories probed the properties of light
and the structure of atoms. Their labors had immediate applica-

tions in astronomy. Armed with this new understanding of light
and matter, astronomers were able to probe in detail the chemical and physical properties of planets, stars, and galaxies.

the source and the observer
In addition to telling us about temperature and chemical composition, the spectrum of a planet, star, or galaxy can also reveal
something about that object’s motion through space. This idea

The Doppler Effect

In Figure 5-26 a light source is moving from right to left; the circles represent the crests of waves emitted
from the moving source at various
positions. Each successive wave crest is emitted from a position
slightly closer to the observer on the left, so she sees a shorter
wavelength—the distance from one crest to the next—than she
would if the source were stationary. All the lines in the spectrum

The Doppler Effect The wavelength of light is affected by
motion between the light source and an observer. The light
source shown here is moving, so wave crests 1, 2, etc., emitted when
the source was at points S1, S2, etc., are crowded together in front of the
source but are spread out behind it. Consequently, wavelengths are
shortened (blueshifted) if the source is moving toward the observer and
lengthened (redshifted) if the source is moving away from the observer.
Motion perpendicular to an observer’s line of sight does not affect
wavelength.

But in the spectrum of the star Vega (Figure 5-21), this line

about the motion of Vega?

Situation: Our goal is to use the ideas of the Doppler effect
to find the velocity of Vega toward or away from Earth.

Tools: We use the Doppler shift formula, ␭/␭0 ⫽ v/c, to
determine Vega’s velocity v.

Answer: The wavelength shift is

The negative value means that we see the light from

blueshift. (Note that the shift is very tiny and can be
measured only using specialized equipment.) From the

Review: The minus sign indicates that Vega is coming toward
us at 14 km/s. The star may also be moving perpendicular to
the line from Earth to Vega, but such motion produces no
Doppler shift.
By plotting the motions of stars such as Vega toward

of an approaching source are shifted toward the short-wavelength
(blue) end of the spectrum. This phenomenon is called a blueshift.
The source is receding from the observer on the right in Figure 5-26. The wave crests that reach him are stretched apart, so
that he sees a longer wavelength than he would if the source were
stationary. All the lines in the spectrum of a receding source are
shifted toward the longer-wavelength (red) end of the spectrum,
producing a redshift. In general, the effect of relative motion on
wavelength is called the Doppler effect. Police radar guns use the
Doppler effect to check for cars exceeding the speed limit: the
radar gun sends a radio wave toward the car, and measures the
wavelength shift of the reflected wave (and thus the speed of
the car).

spectrum, hydrogen atoms emit and absorb photons with a
wavelength of 21.12 cm, giving rise to a spectral feature
commonly called the 21-centimeter line. The galaxy NGC
3840 in the constellation Leo (the Lion) is receding from us
at a speed of 7370 km/s, or about 2.5% of the speed of
light. At what wavelength do we expect to detect the 21-cm
line from this galaxy?

Situation: Given the velocity of NGC 3840 away from us,
our goal is to find the wavelength as measured on Earth of
the 21-centimeter line from this galaxy.

Tools: We use the Doppler shift formula to calculate the
wavelength shift ⌬␭, then use this to find the wavelength ␭
measured on Earth.
Answer: The wavelength shift is

Therefore, we will detect the 21-cm line of hydrogen
from this galaxy at a wavelength of
␭ ⫽ ␭0 ⫹ ⌬␭ ⫽ 21.12 cm ⫹ 0.52 cm ⫽ 21.64 cm

Review: The 21-cm line has been redshifted to a longer
wavelength because the galaxy is receding from us. In fact,
most galaxies are receding from us. This observation is one
of the key pieces of evidence that the universe is expanding,
and has been doing so since the Big Bang that took place
almost 14 billion years ago.

ANALOGY You have probably noticed a similar Doppler effect
for sound waves. When a police car is approaching, the sound
waves from its siren have a shorter wavelength and higher frequency than if the siren were at rest, and hence you hear a
higher pitch. After the police car passes you and is moving away,
you hear a lower pitch from the siren because the sound waves
have a longer wavelength and a lower frequency.
Suppose that ␭0 is the wavelength of a particular spectral line
from a light source that is not moving. It is the wavelength that
you might look up in a reference book or determine in a laboratory experiment for this spectral line. If the source is moving, this
particular spectral line is shifted to a different wavelength ␭. The

The Nature of Light

size of the wavelength shift is usually written as ⌬␭, where ⌬␭ ⫽
␭ ⫺ ␭0. Thus, ⌬␭ is the difference between the wavelength listed
in reference books and the wavelength that you actually observe
in the spectrum of a star or galaxy.
Doppler proved that the wavelength shift (⌬␭) is governed by
the following simple equation:
Doppler shift equation
⌬␭
␯
ᎏ ⫽ ᎏ
␭0
c
⌬␭ ⫽ wavelength shift
␭0 ⫽ wavelength if source is not moving
v ⫽ velocity of the source measured along the line of sight
c ⫽ speed of light ⫽ 3.0 ⫻ 105 km/s

CAUTION! The capital Greek letter ⌬ (delta) is commonly used
to denote a change in the value of a quantity. Thus, ⌬␭ is the
change in the wavelength ␭ due to the Doppler effect. It is not
equal to a quantity ⌬ multiplied by a second quantity ␭!

Interpreting the Doppler Effect
The velocity determined from the Doppler effect is called radial
velocity, because v is the component of the star’s motion parallel
to our line of sight, or along the “radius” drawn from Earth to
the star. Of course, a sizable fraction of a star’s motion may be
perpendicular to our line of sight. The speed of this transverse
movement across the sky does not affect wavelengths if the speed
is small compared with c. Box 5-6 includes two examples of calculations with radial velocity using the Doppler formula.

CAUTION! The redshifts and blueshifts of stars visible to the
naked eye, or even through a small telescope, are only a small
fraction of a nanometer. These tiny wavelength changes are far
too small to detect visually. (Astronomers were able to detect
the tiny Doppler shifts of starlight only after they had developed
highly sensitive equipment for measuring wavelengths. This was
done around 1890, a half-century after Doppler’s original proposal.) So, if you see a star with a red color, it means that the
star really is red; it does not mean that it is moving rapidly away
from us.
The Doppler effect is an important tool in astronomy because
it uncovers basic information about the motions of planets, stars,
and galaxies. For example, the rotation of the planet Venus was
deduced from the Doppler shift of radar waves reflected from its
surface. Small Doppler shifts in the spectrum of sunlight have
shown that the entire Sun is vibrating like an immense gong. The
back-and-forth Doppler shifting of the spectral lines of certain
stars reveals that these stars are being orbited by unseen companions; from this astronomers have discovered planets around other
stars and massive objects that may be black holes. Astronomers
also use the Doppler effect along with Kepler’s third law to measure the masses of galaxies. These are but a few examples of how

123

Doppler’s discovery has empowered astronomers in their quest to
understand the universe.
In this chapter we have glimpsed how much can be learned by
analyzing light from the heavens. To analyze this light, however, it
is first necessary to collect as much of it as possible, because most
light sources in space are very dim. Collecting the faint light from
distant objects is a key purpose of telescopes. In the next chapter
we will describe both how telescopes work and how they are used.

• The intensities of radiation emitted at various wavelengths by a
blackbody at a given temperature are shown by a blackbody

• Wien’s law states that the dominant wavelength at which a
blackbody emits electromagnetic radiation is inversely proportional to the Kelvin temperature of the object: ␭max (in meters) ⫽
(0.0029 K m)/T.
• The Stefan-Boltzmann law states that a blackbody radiates electromagnetic waves with a total energy flux F directly proportional
to the fourth power of the Kelvin temperature T of the object:

Photons: An explanation of blackbody curves led to the discovery that light has particlelike properties. The particles of light are

Optics and
Telescopes

Modern telescopes can view the universe in every range of electromagnetic
radiation, although some must be placed above Earth’s atmosphere. (Visible:
NOAO; Infrared: NASA/JPL-Caltech/C. Engelbracht, University of Arizona)

here is literally more to the universe than meets the eye. As
seen through a small telescope, the galaxy M82 (shown in
the accompanying image) appears as a bright patch that
glows with the light of its billions of stars. But when observed
with a telescope sensitive to infrared light—with wavelengths
longer than your eye can detect—M82 displays an immense halo
that extends for tens of thousands of light-years. The spectrum of
this halo reveals it to be composed of tiny dust particles, which
are ejected by newly formed stars. The halo’s tremendous size
shows that stars are forming in M82 at a far greater rate than
within our own Galaxy.
These observations are just one example of the tremendous
importance of telescopes to astronomy. Whether a telescope detects visible or nonvisible light, its fundamental purpose is the
same: to gather more light than can the unaided eye. Telescopes
are used to gather the feeble light from distant objects to make
bright, sharp images. Telescopes also produce finely detailed spectra of objects in space. These spectra reveal the chemical composition of nearby planets as well as of distant galaxies, and help
astronomers understand the nature and evolution of astronomical objects of all kinds.
As the accompanying images of the galaxy M82 show, telescopes for nonvisible light reveal otherwise hidden aspects of
the universe. In addition to infrared telescopes, radio telescopes
have mapped out the structure of our Milky Way Galaxy; ultraviolet telescopes have revealed the workings of the Sun’s outer
atmosphere; and gamma-ray telescopes have detected the most
powerful explosions in the universe. The telescope, in all its

T

variations, is by far astronomers’ most useful tool for collecting
data about the universe.

6-1 A refracting telescope uses a lens to
concentrate incoming light at a focus
The optical telescope—that is, a telescope designed for use with
visible light—was invented in the Netherlands in the early seventeenth century. Soon after, Galileo used one of these new inventions for his groundbreaking
astronomical observations (see Sec- Refracting telescopes
tion 4-5). These first telescopes used gave humans the first
carefully shaped pieces of glass, or close-up views of the
lenses, to make distant objects ap- Moon and planets
pear larger and brighter. Telescopes
of this same basic design are used today by many amateur astronomers. To understand telescopes of this kind, we need to understand how lenses work.

Refraction of Light
All lenses, including those used in telescopes, make use of the
same physical principle: Light travels at a slower speed in a dense
substance. Thus, although the speed of light in a vacuum is 3.00 ⫻
108 m/s, its speed in glass is less than 2 ⫻ 108 m/s. Just as a
woman’s walking pace slows suddenly when she walks from a
boardwalk onto a sandy beach, so light slows abruptly as it enters a piece of glass. The same woman easily resumes her original

pace when she steps back onto the boardwalk; in the same way,
light resumes its original speed upon exiting the glass.
A material through which light travels is called a medium
(plural media). As a beam of light passes from one transparent
medium into another—say, from air into glass, or from glass back
into air—the direction of the light can change. This phenomenon,
called refraction, is caused by the change in the speed of light.

ANALOGY Imagine driving a car from a smooth pavement
onto a sandy beach (Figure 6-1a). If the car approaches the
beach head-on, it slows down when it enters the sand but keeps
moving straight ahead. If the car approaches the beach at an angle, however, one of the front wheels will be slowed by the sand
before the other is, and the car will veer from its original direction. In the same way, a beam of light changes direction when
it enters a piece of glass at an angle (Figure 6-1b).

If the car enters the sand
at an angle, it slows dow
and changes direction.

(b) How light beams behave

Figure 6-1
Refraction (a) When a car drives from smooth pavement into soft sand,
it slows down. If it enters the sand at an angle, the front wheel on one
side feels the drag of the sand before the other wheel, causing the car to
veer to the side and change direction. (b) Similarly, light slows down when
it passes from a vacuum into glass and changes direction if it enters the
glass at an angle.

Parallel
light rays

Figure 6-2a shows the refraction of a beam of light passing
through a piece of flat glass. As the beam enters the upper surface of the glass, refraction takes place, and the beam is bent to
a direction more nearly perpendicular to the surface of the glass.
As the beam exits from the glass back into the surrounding air, a
second refraction takes place, and the beam bends in the opposite
sense. (The amount of bending depends on the speed of light in
the glass, so different kinds of glass produce slightly different
amounts of refraction.) Because the two surfaces of the glass are
parallel, the beam emerges from the glass traveling in the same direction in which it entered.

Lenses and Refracting Telescopes
Something more useful happens if the glass is curved into a convex shape (one that is fatter in the middle than at the edges), like
the lens in Figure 6-2b. When a beam of light rays passes through
the lens, refraction causes all the rays to converge at a point called
the focus. If the light rays entering the lens are all parallel, the focus occurs at a special point called the focal point. The distance
from the lens to the focal point is called the focal length of
the lens.
The case of parallel light rays, shown in Figure 6-2b, is not
merely a theoretical ideal. The stars are so far away that light rays

Refraction and Lenses (a) Refraction is the change in
direction of a light ray when it passes into or out of a
transparent medium such as glass. When light rays pass
through a flat piece of glass, the two refractions bend the rays
in opposite directions. There is no overall change in the
direction in which the light travels. (b) If the glass is in the
shape of a convex lens, parallel light rays converge to a focus
at a special point called the focal point. The distance from the
lens to the focal point is called the focal length of the lens.

Optics and Telescopes

from them are essentially parallel, as Figure 6-3 shows. Consequently, a lens always focuses light from an astronomical object
to the focal point. If the object has a very small angular size, like
a distant star, all the light entering the lens from that object converges onto the focal point. The resulting image is just a single
bright dot.
However, if the object is extended—that is, has a relatively
large angular size, like the Moon or a planet—then light coming
from each point on the object is brought to a focus at its own individual point. The result is an extended image that lies in the focal plane of the lens (Figure 6-4), which is a plane that includes
the focal point. You can use an ordinary magnifying glass in this
way to make an image of the Sun on the ground.
To use a lens to make a photograph of an astronomical object, you would place a piece of film or an electronic detector in
the focal plane. An ordinary film camera or digital camera works
in the same way for taking photographs of relatively close objects
here on Earth. Most observations for astronomical research are

object is formed in a plane called the focal plane. The distance from the
lens to the focal plane is called the focal length.

Light Rays from Distant Objects Are Parallel Light rays travel away
in all directions from an ordinary light source. If a lens is located very far

these rays will be essentially parallel. This is why we drew parallel rays
entering the lens in Figure 6-2b.

done in this way to produce a permanent record of the observation. Furthermore, modern image-recording technology is far
more sensitive than the human eye, as we will see in Section 6-4.
But many amateur astronomers want to view the image visually,
and so they add a second lens to magnify the image formed in the
focal plane. Such an arrangement of two lenses is called a refracting telescope, or refractor (Figure 6-5). The large-diameter, longfocal-length lens at the front of the telescope, called the objective
lens, forms the image; the smaller, shorter-focal-length lens at the
rear of the telescope, called the eyepiece lens, magnifies the image
for the observer.

Light-Gathering Power
In addition to the focal length, the other important dimension of
the objective lens of a refractor is the diameter. Compared with

a small-diameter lens, a large-diameter lens captures more light,
produces brighter images, and allows astronomers to detect fainter
objects. (For the same reason, the iris of your eye opens when you
go into a darkened room to allow you to see dimly lit objects.)
The light-gathering power of a telescope is directly proportional to the area of the objective lens, which in turn is
proportional to the square of the lens diameter (Figure 6-6).
Thus, if you double the diameter of the lens, the light-gathering
power increases by a factor of 22 ⫽ 2 ⫻ 2 ⫽ 4. Box 6-1 describes how to compare the light-gathering power of different
telescopes.
Because light-gathering power is so important for seeing faint
objects, the lens diameter is almost always given in describing a
telescope. For example, the Lick telescope on Mount Hamilton in
California is a 90-cm refractor, which means that it is a refracting telescope whose objective lens is 90 cm in diameter. By com-

parison, Galileo’s telescope of 1610 was a 3-cm refractor. The
Lick telescope has an objective lens 30 times larger in diameter,
and so has 30 ⫻ 30 ⫽ 900 times the light-gathering power of
Galileo’s instrument.

Magnification
In addition to their light-gathering power, telescopes are useful
because they magnify distant objects. As an example, the angular
diameter of the Moon as viewed with the naked eye is about 0.5°.
But when Galileo viewed the Moon through his telescope, its apparent angular diameter was 10°, large enough so that he could
identify craters and mountain ranges. The magnification, or magnifying power, of a telescope is the ratio of an object’s angular diameter seen through the telescope to its naked-eye angular
diameter. Thus, the magnification of Galileo’s telescope was
10°/0.5° ⫽ 20 times, usually written as 20⫻.

Light-Gathering Power These two photographs of the
galaxy M31 in Andromeda were taken using the same
exposure time and at the same magnification, but with
two different telescopes with objective lenses of different
diameters. The right-hand photograph is brighter and
shows more detail because it was made using the largediameter lens, which intercepts more starlight than a
small-diameter lens. This same principle applies to
telescopes that use curved mirrors rather than lenses to
collect light (see Section 6-2). (Association of Universities

Magnification and Light-Gathering Power
he magnification of a telescope is equal to the focal length
of the objective divided by the focal length of the eyepiece.
T
Telescopic eyepieces are usually interchangeable, so the mag-

power of the eye. (Recall that there are 10 mm in 1 cm.) Hence,
this telescope allows you to see objects 100 times fainter than
you can see without a telescope.

nification of a telescope can be changed by using eyepieces of
different focal lengths.

EXAMPLE: The same relationships apply to reflecting

EXAMPLE: A small refracting telescope has an objective of
focal length 120 cm. If the eyepiece has a focal length of
4.0 cm, what is the magnification of the telescope?

Situation: We are given the focal lengths of the telescope’s
objective and eyepiece lenses. Our goal is to calculate the
magnification provided by this combination of lenses.

Tools: We use the relationship that the magnification equals
the focal length of the objective (120 cm) divided by the
focal length of the eyepiece (4.0 cm).

Answer: Using this relationship,
120 cm
Magnification ⫽ ᎏᎏ ⫽ 30 (usually written as 30⫻)
4.0 cm

Review: A magnification of 30⫻ means that as viewed
through this telescope, a large lunar crater that subtends an
angle of 1 arcminute to the naked eye will appear to subtend
an angle 30 times greater, or 30 arcminutes (one-half of a
degree). This makes the details of the crater much easier
to see.
If a 2.0-cm-focal-length eyepiece is used instead, the
magnification will be (120 cm)/(2.0 cm) ⫽ 60⫻. The shorter
the focal length of the eyepiece, the greater the
magnification.
The light-gathering power of a telescope depends on the
diameter of the objective lens; it does not depend on the focal
length. The light-gathering power is proportional to the square
of the diameter. As an example, a fully dark adapted human
eye has a pupil diameter of about 5 mm. By comparison, a
small telescope whose objective lens is 5 cm in diameter has 10
times the diameter and 102 ⫽ 100 times the light-gathering

telescopes, discussed in Section 6-2. Each of the two Keck
telescopes on Mauna Kea in Hawaii (discussed in Section
6-3; see Figure 6-16) uses a concave mirror 10 m in diameter
to bring starlight to a focus. How many times greater is the
light-gathering power of either Keck telescope compared to
that of the human eye?

Situation: We are given the diameters of the pupil of the
human eye (5 mm) and of the mirror of either Keck telescope
(10 m). Our goal is to compare the light-gathering powers of
these two optical instruments.

Tools: We use the relationship that light-gathering power is
proportional to the square of the diameter of the area that
gathers light. Hence, the ratio of the light-gathering powers
is equal to the square of the ratio of the diameters.
Answer: We first calculate the ratio of the diameter of the
Keck mirror to the diameter of the pupil. To do this, we
must first express both diameters in the same units. Because
there are 1000 mm in 1 meter, the diameter of the Keck
mirror can be expressed as
1000 mm
10 m ⫻ ᎏᎏ ⫽ 10,000 mm

Review: Either Keck telescope can gather 4 million times as
much light as a human eye. When it comes to light-gathering
power, the bigger the telescope, the better!

CAUTION! Many people think that the primary purpose of a
telescope is to magnify images. But in fact magnification is not
the most important aspect of a telescope. The reason is that
there is a limit to how sharp any astronomical image can be, due
either to the blurring caused by the Earth’s atmosphere or to
fundamental limitations imposed by the nature of light itself.
(We will describe these effects in more detail in Section 6-3.)
Magnifying a blurred image may make it look bigger but will
not make it any clearer. Thus, beyond a certain point, there is

134

Chapter 6

nothing to be gained by further magnification. Astronomers put
much more store in the light-gathering power of a telescope than
in its magnification. Greater light-gathering power means
brighter images, which makes it easier to see faint details.

Disadvantages of Refracting Telescopes
If you were to build a telescope like that in Figure 6-5 using only
the instructions given so far, you would probably be disappointed
with the results. The problem is that a lens bends different colors
of light through different angles, just as a prism does (recall Figure 5-3). As a result, different colors do not focus at the same
point, and stars viewed through a telescope that uses a simple lens
are surrounded by fuzzy, rainbow-colored halos. Figure 6-7a
shows this optical defect, called chromatic aberration.
One way to correct for chromatic aberration is to use an objective lens that is not just a single piece of glass. Different types
of glass can be manufactured by adding small amounts of chemicals to the glass when it is molten. Because of these chemicals,
the speed of light varies slightly from one kind of glass to another,
and the refractive properties vary as well. If a thin lens is mounted
just behind the main objective lens of a telescope, as shown in Figure 6-7b, and if the telescope designer carefully chooses two different kinds of glass for these two lenses, different colors of light
can be brought to a focus at the same point.
Chromatic aberration is only the most severe of a host of optical problems that must be solved in designing a high-quality refracting telescope. Master opticians of the nineteenth century
devoted their careers to solving these problems, and several magnificent refractors were constructed in the late 1800s (Figure 6-8).
Unfortunately, there are several negative aspects of refractors
that even the finest optician cannot overcome:

1. Because faint light must readily pass through the objective
lens, the glass from which the lens is made must be totally free
of defects, such as the bubbles that frequently form when
molten glass is poured into a mold. Such defect-free glass is
extremely expensive.
2. Glass is opaque to certain kinds of light. Ultraviolet light is
absorbed almost completely, and even visible light is dimmed
substantially as it passes through the thick slab of glass that
makes up the objective lens.
3. It is impossible to produce a large lens that is entirely free of
chromatic aberration.
4. Because the lens can be supported only around its edges, it
tends to sag and distort under its own weight. This has adverse
effects on the image clarity.
For these reasons and more, few major refractors have been
built since the beginning of the twentieth century. Instead, astronomers have avoided all of the limitations of refractors by
building telescopes that use a mirror instead of a lens to form an
image.

6-2 A reflecting telescope uses a mirror to
concentrate incoming light at a focus
Almost all modern telescopes form an image using the principle
of reflection. To understand reflection, imagine drawing a dashed
line perpendicular to the surface of a flat mirror at the point
where a light ray strikes the mirror (Figure 6-9a). The angle i between the incident (arriving) light ray and the perpendicular is al-

ror makes parallel light rays converge to a focus (Figure 6-9b).
The distance between the reflecting surface and the focus is the
focal length of the mirror. A telescope that uses a curved mirror
to make an image of a distant object is called a reflecting telescope, or reflector. Using terminology similar to that used for refractors, the mirror that forms the image is called the objective
mirror or primary mirror.

Chapter 6

If you try to view the image formed at the focal point, your head
will block part or all of the light from reaching the mirror.
To get around this problem, in 1668 Isaac Newton simply
placed a small, flat mirror at a 45° angle in front of the focal
point, as sketched in Figure 6-10a. This secondary mirror deflects the light rays to one side, where Newton placed an eyepiece lens to magnify the image. A reflecting telescope with this
optical design is appropriately called a Newtonian reflector (Figure 6-10b). The magnifying power of a Newtonian reflector is
calculated in the same way as for a refractor: The focal length
of the objective mirror is divided by the focal length of the eyepiece (see Box 6-1).
Later astronomers modified Newton’s original design. The
objective mirrors of some modern reflectors are so large that an
astronomer could actually sit in an “observing cage” at the undeflected focal point directly in front of the objective mirror. (In
practice, riding in this cage on a winter’s night is a remarkably
cold and uncomfortable experience.) This arrangement is called
a prime focus (Figure 6-11a). It usually provides the highestquality image, because there is no need for a secondary mirror
(which might have imperfections).

To make a reflector, an optician grinds and polishes a large
slab of glass into the appropriate concave shape. The glass is then
coated with silver, aluminum, or a similar highly reflective substance. Because light reflects off the surface of the glass rather
than passing through it, defects within the glass—which would
have very negative consequences for the objective lens of a refracting telescope—have no effect on the optical quality of a reflecting telescope.
Another advantage of reflectors is that they do not suffer
from the chromatic aberration that plagues refractors. This is because reflection is not affected by the wavelength of the incoming
light, so all wavelengths are reflected to the same focus. (A small
amount of chromatic aberration may arise if the image is viewed
using an eyepiece lens.) Furthermore, the mirror can be fully supported by braces on its back, so that a large, heavy mirror can be
mounted without much danger of breakage or surface distortion.

Designs for Reflecting Telescopes
Although a reflecting telescope has many advantages over a refractor, the arrangement shown in Figure 6-9a is not ideal. One
problem is that the focal point is in front of the objective mirror.

in Figure 6-11 would cause a black spot or hole in the center of
the telescope image. But this does not happen. The reason is that
light from every part of the object lands on every part of the primary, objective mirror. Hence, any portion of the mirror can itself produce an image of the distant object, as Figure 6-12 shows.
The only effect of the secondary mirror is that it prevents part
of the light from reaching the objective mirror, which reduces
somewhat the light-gathering power of the telescope.

A reflecting telescope must be designed to minimize a defect called
spherical aberration (Figure 6-13). At issue is the precise shape of
a mirror’s concave surface. A spherical surface is easy to grind
and polish, but different parts of a spherical mirror have slightly
different focal lengths (Figure 6-13a). This results in a fuzzy
image.
One common way to eliminate spherical aberration is to polish the mirror’s surface to a parabolic shape, because a parabola
reflects parallel light rays to a common focus (Figure 6-13b). Unfortunately, the astronomer then no longer has a wide-angle view.
Furthermore, unlike spherical mirrors, parabolic mirrors suffer

Figure 6-11
Designs for Reflecting Telescopes Three common optical

designs for reflecting telescopes are shown here. (a) Prime
focus is used only on some large telescopes; an observer or instrument is
placed directly at the focal point, within the barrel of the telescope.
(b) The Cassegrain focus is used on reflecting telescopes of all sizes, from
90-mm (3.5-in.) reflectors used by amateur astronomers to giant research
telescopes on Mauna Kea (see Figure 6-14). (c) The coudé focus is useful
when large and heavy optical apparatus is to be used at the focal point.
Light reflects off the objective mirror to a secondary mirror, then back down
to a third, angled mirror. With this arrangement, the heavy apparatus at the
focal point does not have to move when the telescope is repositioned.

Another popular optical design, called a Cassegrain focus after the French contemporary of Newton who first proposed it,
also has a convenient, accessible focal point. A hole is drilled directly through the center of the primary mirror, and a convex secondary mirror placed in front of the original focal point reflects
the light rays back through the hole (Figure 6-11b).
A fourth design is useful when there is optical equipment too
heavy or bulky to mount directly on the telescope. Instead, a series of mirrors channels the light rays away from the telescope to
a remote focal point where the equipment is located. This design
is called a coudé focus, from a French word meaning “bent like
an elbow” (Figure 6-11c).

total amount of light that reaches the primary mirror.)

from a defect called coma, wherein star images far from the center of the field of view are elongated to look like tiny teardrops.
A different approach is to use a spherical mirror, thus minimizing coma, and to place a thin correcting lens at the front of the
telescope to eliminate spherical aberration (Figure 6-13c). This
approach is only used on relatively small reflecting telescopes for
amateur astronomers.

As of 2007, there were 13 optical reflectors in operation with primary mirrors between 8 meters (26.2 feet)
and 11 meters (36.1 feet) in diameter. Figure 6-14a
shows the objective mirror of one of the four Very Large Telescope (VLT) units in Chile, and Figure 6-14b shows the objective
and secondary mirrors of the Gemini North telescope in Hawaii.
A near-twin of Gemini North, called Gemini South, is in Cerro
Pachón, Chile. These twins allow astronomers to observe both the
northern and southern parts of the celestial sphere with essentially
the same state-of-the-art instrument. Two other “twins” are the
side-by-side 8.4-m objective mirrors of the Large Binocular Telescope in Arizona. Combining the light from these two mirrors
gives double the light-gathering power, equivalent to a single
11.8-m mirror.

Optics and Telescopes

Several other reflectors around the world have objective mirrors between 3 and 6 meters in diameter, and dozens of smaller
but still powerful telescopes have mirrors in the range of 1 to 3
meters. There are thousands of professional astronomers, each of
whom has several ongoing research projects, and thus the demand
for all of these telescopes is high. On any night of the year, nearly
every research telescope in the world is being used to explore the
universe.

6-3 Telescope images are degraded by the
blurring effects of the atmosphere and by
light pollution
In addition to providing a brighter image, a large telescope also
helps achieve a second major goal: It produces star images that
are sharp and crisp. A quantity called angular resolution gauges
how well fine details can be seen. Poor angular resolution causes
star images to be fuzzy and blurred together.
To determine the angular resolution of a telescope, pick out
two adjacent stars whose separate images are just barely discernible (Figure 6-15). The angle ␪ (the Greek letter theta) between these stars is the telescope’s angular resolution; the smaller
that angle, the finer the details that can be seen and the sharper
the image.
When you are asked to read the letters on an eye chart,
what’s being measured is the angular resolution of your eye. If
you have 20/20 vision, the angular
resolution ␪ of your eye is about 1 Adaptive optics produces
arcminute, or 60 arcseconds. (You sharper images by
may want to review the definitions “undoing” atmospheric
of these angular measures in Section turbulence
1-5.) Hence, with the naked eye it is
impossible to distinguish two stars less than 1 arcminute apart
or to see details on the Moon with an angular size smaller than
this. All the planets have angular sizes (as seen from Earth) of
1 arcminute or less, which is why they appear as featureless
points of light to the naked eye.

Limits to Angular Resolution
One factor limiting angular resolution is diffraction, which is the
tendency of light waves to spread out when they are confined to
a small area like the lens or mirror of a telescope. (A rough analogy is the way water exiting a garden hose sprays out in a wider
angle when you cover part of the end of the hose with your
thumb.) As a result of diffraction, a narrow beam of light tends
to spread out within a telescope’s optics, thus blurring the image.
If diffraction were the only limit, the angular resolution of a telescope would be given by the formula

angular separation is equal to the angular resolution. If the sources were
moved any closer together, the telescope image would show them as a

␭ ⫽ wavelength of light, in meters
D ⫽ diameter of telescope objective, in meters
For a given wavelength of light, using a telescope with an objective of larger diameter D reduces the amount of diffraction and
makes the angular resolution ␪ smaller (and hence better). For example, with red light with wavelength 640 nm, or 6.4 ⫻ 10⫺7 m,
the diffraction-limited resolution of an 8-meter telescope (see Figure 6-15) would be

In practice, however, ordinary optical telescopes cannot
achieve such fine angular resolution. The problem is that turbulence in the air causes star images to jiggle around and twinkle.
Even through the largest telescopes, a star still looks like a tiny
blob rather than a pinpoint of light. A measure of the limit that
atmospheric turbulence places on a telescope’s resolution is called
the seeing disk. This disk is the angular diameter of a star’s image broadened by turbulence. The size of the seeing disk varies

from one observatory site to another and from one night to another. At the observatories on Kitt Peak in Arizona and Cerro
Tololo in Chile, the seeing disk is typically around 1 arcsec. Some
of the very best conditions in the world can be found at the observatories atop Mauna Kea in Hawaii, where the seeing disk is
often as small as 0.5 arcsec. This is one reason why so many telescopes have been built there (Figure 6-16).

Active Optics and Adaptive Optics
In many cases the angular resolution of a telescope is even worse
than the limit imposed by the seeing disk. This occurs if the objective mirror deforms even slightly due to variations in air temperature or flexing of the telescope mount. To combat this, many
large telescopes are equipped with an active optics system. Such
a system adjusts the mirror shape every few seconds to help keep
the telescope in optimum focus and properly aimed at its target.
Changing the mirror shape is also at the heart of a more refined technique called adaptive optics. The goal of this technique
is to compensate for atmospheric turbulence, so that the angular
resolution can be smaller than the size of the seeing disk and can
even approach the theoretical limit set by diffraction. Turbulence
causes the image of a star to “dance” around erratically. In an
adaptive optics system, sensors monitor this dancing motion 10
to 100 times per second, and a powerful computer rapidly calculates the mirror shape needed to compensate. Fast-acting mechanical devices called actuators then deform the mirror accordingly,
at a much faster rate than in an active optics system. In some
adaptive optics systems, the actuators deform a small secondary
mirror rather than the large objective mirror.
One difficulty with adaptive optics is that a fairly bright star
must be in or near the field of the telescope’s view to serve as a
“target” for the sensors that track atmospheric turbulence. This
is seldom the case, since the field of view of most telescopes is
rather narrow. Astronomers get around this limitation by shining

a laser beam toward a spot in the sky near the object to be observed (Figure 6-17). The laser beam causes atoms in the upper
atmosphere to glow, making an artificial “star.” The light that
comes down to Earth from this “star” travels through the same
part of our atmosphere as the light from the object being observed, so its image in the telescope will “dance” around in the
same erratic way as the image of a real star.
Figure 6-18 shows the dramatic improvement in angular resolution possible with adaptive optics. Images made with adaptive
optics are nearly as sharp as if the telescope were in the vacuum
of space, where there is no atmospheric distortion whatsoever and
the only limit on angular resolution is diffraction. A number of
large telescopes are now being used with adaptive optics systems.

CAUTION! The images in Figure 6-18 are false color images:
They do not represent the true color of the stars shown. False
color is often used when the image is made using wavelengths
that the eye cannot detect, as with the infrared images in Figure
6-18. A different use of false color is to indicate the relative
brightness of different parts of the image, as in the infrared image of a person in Figure 5-10. Throughout this book, we’ll always point out when false color is used in an image.

Interferometry
Several large observatories are developing a technique called interferometry that promises to further improve the angular resolution of telescopes. The idea is to have two widely separated
telescopes observe the same object simultaneously, then use fiber
optic cables to “pipe” the light signals from each telescope to a
central location where they “interfere” or blend together. This
makes the combined signal sharp and clear. The effective resolution of such a combination of telescopes is equivalent to that of
one giant telescope with a diameter equal to the baseline, or distance between the two telescopes. For example, the Keck I and

Light Pollution
N

Figure 6-17

Light from city street lamps and from buildings also
degrades telescope images. This light pollution illuminates the sky, making it more difficult to see the stars.
You can appreciate the problem if you have ever looked at the
night sky from a major city. Only a few of the very brightest stars
can be seen, as against the thousands that can be seen with the
naked eye in the desert or the mountains. To avoid light pollution, observatories are built in remote locations far from any city
lights.
Unfortunately, the expansion of cities has brought light
pollution to observatories that in former times had none. As an
example, the growth of Tucson, Arizona, has had deleterious
effects on observations at the nearby Kitt Peak National Observatory. Efforts have been made to have cities adopt light fixtures that provide safe illumination for their citizens but produce
little light pollution. These efforts have met with only mixed
success.
One factor over which astronomers have absolutely no control is the weather. Optical telescopes cannot see through clouds,
so it is important to build observatories where the weather is usually good. One advantage of mountaintop observatories such as
Mauna Kea is that most clouds form at altitudes below the observatory, giving astronomers a better chance of having clear skies.
In many ways the best location for a telescope is in orbit
around Earth, where it is unaffected by weather, light pollution,
or atmospheric turbulence. We will discuss orbiting telescopes in
Section 6-7.

Creating an Artificial “Star” A laser beam shines upward from Yepun,
an 8.2-meter telescope at the European Southern Observatory in the
Atacama Desert of Chile. (Figure 6-14a shows the objective mirror for this
telescope.) The beam strikes sodium atoms that lie about 90 km (56
miles) above the Earth’s surface, causing them to glow and make an
artificial “star.” Tracking the twinkling of this “star” makes it possible to
undo the effects of atmospheric turbulence on telescope images.
(European Southern Observatory)

Keck II telescopes atop Mauna Kea (Figure 6-16) are 85 meters
apart, so when used as an interferometer the angular resolution
is the same as a single 85-meter telescope.
Interferometry has been used for many years with radio telescopes (which we will discuss in Section 6-6), but is still under development with telescopes for visible light or infrared wavelengths.
Astronomers are devoting a great deal of effort to this development because the potential rewards are great. For example, the
Keck I and II telescopes used together should give an angular resolution as small as 0.005 arcsec, which corresponds to being able
to read the bottom row on an eye chart 36 km (22 miles) away!

distinguish individual stars in this region. With adaptive optics turned on,
more than two dozen stars can be distinguished. (UCLA Galactic Center Group)

Chapter 6

6-4 A charge-coupled device is
commonly used to record the
image at a telescope’s focus
Telescopes provide astronomers with detailed pictures of distant
objects. The task of recording these pictures is called imaging.
Astronomical imaging really began in the nineteenth century
with the invention of photography. It was soon realized that this
new invention was a boon to astronomy. By taking long exposures with a camera mounted at the
focus of a telescope, an astronomer The same technology that
can record features too faint to be makes digital cameras
seen by simply looking through the possible has
telescope. Such long exposures can revolutionized astronomy
reveal details in galaxies, star clusters, and nebulae that would not be visible to an astronomer
looking through a telescope. Indeed, most large, modern telescopes do not have eyepieces at all.
Unfortunately, photographic film is not a very efficient light
detector. Only about 1 out of every 50 photons striking photographic film triggers the chemical reaction needed to produce an
image. Thus, roughly 98% of the light falling onto photographic
film is wasted.

Charge-Coupled Devices
The most sensitive light detector currently available to astronomers is the charge-coupled device (CCD). At the heart of a

CCD is a semiconductor wafer divided into an array of small
light-sensitive squares called picture elements or, more commonly,
pixels (Figure 6-19a). For example, each of the 40 CCDs shown
in Figure 6-19a has more than 9.4 million pixels arranged in 2048
rows by 4608 columns. They have about a thousand times more
pixels per square centimeter than on a typical computer screen,
which means that a CCD of this type can record very fine image
details. CCDs with smaller numbers of pixels are used in digital
cameras, scanners, and fax machines.
When an image from a telescope is focused on the CCD, an
electric charge builds up in each pixel in proportion to the number of photons falling on that pixel. When the exposure is finished, the amount of charge on each pixel is read into a computer,
where the resulting image can be stored in digital form and either
viewed on a monitor or printed out. Compared with photographic
film, CCDs are some 35 times more sensitive to light (they commonly respond to 70% of the light falling on them, versus 2%
for film), can record much finer details, and respond more uniformly to light of different colors. Figures 6-19b, 6-19c, and
6-19d show the dramatic difference between photographic and
CCD images. The great sensitivity of CCDs also makes them useful for photometry, which is the measurement of the brightnesses
of stars and other astronomical objects.
In the modern world of CCD astronomy, astronomers need
no longer spend the night in the unheated dome of a telescope.
Instead, they operate the telescope electronically from a separate
control room, where the electronic CCD images can be viewed on
a computer monitor. The control room need not even be adjacent

to the telescope. Although the Keck I and II telescopes (see Figure 6-16) are at an altitude of 4100 m (13,500 feet), astronomers
can now make observations from a facility elsewhere on the island of Hawaii that is much closer to sea level. This saves the laborious drive to the summit of Mauna Kea and eliminates the
need for astronomers to acclimate to the high altitude.
Most of the images that you will see in this book were made
with CCDs. Because of their extraordinary sensitivity and their
ability to be used in conjunction with computers, CCDs have attained a role of central importance in astronomy.

6-5 Spectrographs record the spectra
of astronomical objects
We saw in Section 5-6 how the spectrum of an astronomical object
provides a tremendous amount of information about that object, including its chemical composition and temperature. This is why
measuring spectra, or spectroscopy, is
one of the most important uses of tel- The spectrum of a planet,
escopes. Indeed, some telescopes are star, or galaxy can reveal

Spectrographs and Diffraction Gratings
An essential tool of spectroscopy is the spectrograph, a device
that records spectra. This optical device is mounted at the focus

of a telescope. Figure 6-20a shows one design for a spectrograph,
in which a diffraction grating is used to form the spectrum of a
planet, star, or galaxy. This is a piece of glass on which thousands
of very regularly spaced parallel lines have been cut. Some of the
finest diffraction gratings have more than 10,000 lines per centimeter, which are usually cut by drawing a diamond back and
forth across the glass. When light is shone on a diffraction grating, a spectrum is produced by the way in which light waves leaving different parts of the grating interfere with each other. (This
same effect produces the rainbow of colors you see reflected from
a compact disc or DVD, as shown in Figure 6-20b. Information
is stored on the disc in a series of closely spaced pits, which act
as a diffraction grating.)
Older types of spectrographs used a prism rather than a diffraction grating to form a spectrum. This had several drawbacks.
A prism does not disperse the colors of the rainbow evenly: Blue
and violet portions of the spectrum are spread out more than the
red portion. In addition, because the blue and violet wavelengths
must pass through more of the prism’s glass than do the red
wavelengths (examine Figure 5-3), light is absorbed unevenly
across the spectrum. Indeed, a glass prism is opaque to nearultraviolet light. For these reasons, diffraction gratings are preferred in modern spectrographs.
In Figure 6-20a the spectrum of a planet, star, or galaxy
formed by the diffraction grating is recorded on a CCD. Light
from a hot gas (such as helium, neon, argon, iron, or a combination of these) is then focused on the spectrograph slit. The result
is a comparison spectrum alongside the spectrum of the celestial
object under study. The wavelengths of the bright spectral lines

5-17, which shows the spectrum of the Sun and a comparison

When the exposure is finished, electronic equipment measures the charge that has accumulated in each pixel. These data are
used to graph light intensity against wavelength. Dark absorption
lines in the spectrum appear as depressions or valleys on the

For thousands of years, all the information that astronomers gathered about the universe was based on ordinary visible light. In the
twentieth century, however, astronomers first began to explore
the nonvisible electromagnetic radiation coming from astronomical objects. In this way they have discovered aspects of the cosmos
that are forever hidden to optical

tems in the process of formation. By detecting radio waves from
Jupiter and Saturn, they have mapped the intense magnetic fields
that surround those giant planets; by detecting curious bursts of X
rays from space, they have learned about the utterly alien conditions
in the vicinity of a black hole. It is no exaggeration to say that today’s astronomers learn as much about the universe using telescopes
for nonvisible wavelengths as they do using visible light.

Radio Astronomy
Radio waves were the first part of the electromagnetic spectrum
beyond the visible to be exploited for astronomy. This happened
as a result of a research project seemingly unrelated to astronomy.
In the early 1930s, Karl Jansky, a young electrical engineer at Bell
Telephone Laboratories, was trying to locate what was causing
interference with the then-new transatlantic radio link. By 1932,
he realized that one kind of radio noise is strongest when the constellation Sagittarius is high in the sky. The center of our Galaxy
is located in the direction of Sagittarius, and Jansky concluded
that he was detecting radio waves from an astronomical source.
At first only Grote Reber, a radio engineer living in Illinois,
took up Jansky’s research. In 1936 Reber built in his backyard
the first radio telescope, a radio-wave detector dedicated to astronomy. He modeled his design after an ordinary reflecting telescope, with a parabolic metal “dish” (reflecting antenna)
measuring 31 ft (10 m) in diameter and a radio receiver at the focal point of the dish.
Reber spent the years from 1938 to 1944 mapping radio emissions from the sky at wavelengths of 1.9 m and 0.63 m. He found
radio waves coming from the entire Milky Way, with the greatest

Optics and Telescopes

emission from the center of the Galaxy. These results, together with
the development of improved radio technology during World War
II, encouraged the growth of radio astronomy and the construction
of new radio telescopes around the world. Radio observatories are
as common today as major optical observatories.

Modern Radio Telescopes
Like Reber’s prototype, a typical modern radio telescope has a
large parabolic dish (Figure 6-22). An antenna tuned to the desired frequency is located at the focus (like the prime focus design
for optical reflecting telescopes shown in Fig. 6-11a). The incoming signal is relayed from the antenna to amplifiers and recording
instruments, typically located in a room at the base of the telescope’s pier.

CAUTION! The radio telescope in Figure 6-22 looks like a radar
dish but is used in a different way. In radar, the dish is used to
send out a narrow beam of radio waves. If this beam encounters
an object like an airplane, some of the radio waves will be reflected
back to the radar dish and detected by a receiver at the focus of
the dish. Thus, a radar dish looks for radio waves reflected by distant objects. By contrast, a radio telescope is designed to receive
radio waves emitted by objects in space.

reflecting power because the holes are much smaller than the
wavelengths of the radio waves. The same idea is used in the design of microwave ovens. The glass window in the oven door
would allow the microwaves to leak out, so the window is covered by a metal screen with small holes. These holes are much
smaller than the 12.2-cm (4.8-in.) wavelength of the microwaves,
so the screen reflects the microwaves back into the oven.

Radio Telescopes: Limits to Angular Resolution
One great drawback of early radio telescopes was their very
poor angular resolution. Recall from Section 6-3 that angular
resolution is the smallest angular separation between two stars
that can just barely be distinguished as separate objects. Unlike
visible light, radio waves are only slightly affected by turbulence in the atmosphere, so the limitation on the angular resolution of a radio telescope is diffraction. The problem is that
diffraction-limited angular resolution is directly proportional to
the wavelength being observed: The longer the wavelength, the
larger (and hence worse) the angular resolution and the fuzzier
the image. (See the formula for angular resolution ␪ in Section
6-3.) As an example, a 1-m radio telescope detecting radio
waves of 5-cm wavelength has 100,000 times poorer angular
resolution than a 1-m optical telescope. Because radio radiation
has very long wavelengths, small radio telescopes can produce
only blurry, indistinct images.

A Radio Telescope The dish of the Parkes radio telescope in New South
Wales, Australia, is 64 m (210 ft) in diameter. Radio waves reflected from

point. (David Nunuk/Photo Researchers)

A very large radio telescope can produce a somewhat
sharper radio image, because as the diameter of the telescope increases, the angular resolution decreases. In
other words, the bigger the dish, the better the resolution. For this
reason, most modern radio telescopes have dishes more than 30
m (100 ft) in diameter. This is also useful for increasing lightgathering power, because radio signals from astronomical objects
are typically very weak in comparison with the intensity of visible light. But even the largest single radio dish in existence, the
305-m (1000-ft) Arecibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico, cannot
come close to the resolution of the best optical instruments.
To improve angular resolution at radio wavelengths, astronomers combine observations from two or more widely separated telescopes using the interferometry technique that we
described in Section 6-3. This is much easier than for visible or
infrared light because radio signals can be carried over electrical
wires. Consequently, two radio telescopes observing the same astronomical object can be hooked together, even if they are separated by many kilometers. As for visible light, the resulting angular
resolution is that of a single telescope whose diameter is equal to
the baseline, or separation between the telescopes.
One of the largest arrangements of radio telescopes for interferometry is the Very Large Array (VLA), located in the desert
near Socorro, New Mexico (Figure 6-23). The VLA consists of 27
parabolic dishes, each 25 m (82 ft) in diameter. These 27 telescopes are arranged along the arms of a gigantic Y that covers an
area 27 km (17 mi) in diameter. By pointing all 27 telescopes at
the same object and combining the 27 radio signals, this system
can produce radio views of the sky with an angular resolution as
small as 0.05 arcsec, comparable to that of the very best optical
telescopes.

and combining the signals received, the VLA can give the same angular
resolution as a single dish many kilometers in radius. (Courtesy of

Dramatically better angular resolution can be obtained
by combining the signals from radio telescopes at different observatories thousands of kilometers apart. This
technique is called very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI). VLBI
is used by a system called the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA),
which consists of ten 25-meter dishes at different locations between Hawaii and the Caribbean. Although the ten dishes are not
physically connected, they are all used to observe the same object
at the same time. The data from each telescope are recorded electronically and processed later. By carefully synchronizing the ten
recorded signals, they can be combined just as if the telescopes
had been linked together during the observation. With the VLBA,
features smaller than 0.001 arcsec can be distinguished at radio
wavelengths. This angular resolution is 100 times better than a
large optical telescope with adaptive optics.
Even better angular resolution can be obtained by adding radio telescopes in space; the baseline is then the distance from the
VLBA to the orbiting telescope. The first such space radio telescope, the Japanese HALCA spacecraft, operated from 1997 to
2003. Orbiting at a maximum distance of 21,400 km (13,300 mi)
above the Earth’s surface, HALCA gave a baseline three times
longer—and thus an angular resolution three times better—than
can be obtained with Earthbound telescopes alone. Successors to
HALCA may be placed in orbit after 2010.
Figure 6-24 shows how optical and radio images of the same
object can give different and complementary kinds of information. The visible-light image of Saturn (Figure 6-24a) shows
clouds in the planet’s atmosphere and the structure of the rings.

Optical and Radio Views of Saturn (a) This picture was taken by a
spacecraft 18 million kilometers from Saturn. The view was produced by
sunlight reflecting from the planet’s cloudtops and rings. (b) This VLA
image shows radio emission from Saturn at a wavelength of 2 cm. In this
false-color image, the most intense radio emission is shown in red, the
least intense in blue. Yellow and green represent intermediate levels of
radio intensity; black indicates no detectable radio emission. Note the
radio “shadow” caused by Saturn’s rings where they lie in front of the
planet. (a: NASA; b: Image courtesy of NRAO/AUI)

Like the visible light from the Moon, the light used to make this
image is just reflected sunlight. By contrast, the false-color radio
image of Saturn (Figure 6-24b) is a record of waves emitted by
the planet and its rings. Analyzing such images provides information about the structure of Saturn’s atmosphere and rings
that could never be obtained from a visible-light image such as
Figure 6-24a.

The Transparency of the Earth’s Atmosphere This graph shows the
percentage of radiation that can penetrate the Earth’s atmosphere at
different wavelengths. Regions in which the curve is high are called
“windows,” because the atmosphere is relatively transparent at those
wavelengths. There are also three wavelength ranges in which the

atmosphere is opaque and the curve is near zero: at wavelengths less than
about 290 nm, which are absorbed by atmospheric oxygen and nitrogen;
between the optical and radio windows, due to absorption by water vapor
and carbon dioxide; and at wavelengths longer than about 20 m, which are
reflected back into space by ionized gases in the upper atmosphere.

possible to study the
radio waves, very little radiation
from space manages to penetrate universe across the
the air we breathe. To overcome entire electromagnetic
this, astronomers have placed a va- spectrum
riety of telescopes in orbit.
Figure 6-25 shows the transparency of the Earth’s atmosphere to different wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation. The
atmosphere is most transparent in two wavelength regions, the
optical window (which includes the entire visible spectrum) and
the radio window (which includes part, but not all, of the radio
spectrum). There are also several relatively transparent regions at
infrared wavelengths between 1 and 40 ␮m. Infrared radiation
within these wavelength intervals can penetrate the Earth’s atmosphere somewhat and can be detected with ground-based telescopes. This wavelength range is called the near-infrared, because
it lies just beyond the red end of the visible spectrum.

proved by carrying telescopes on board high-altitude balloons or
aircraft. But the ultimate solution is to place a telescope in Earth’s
orbit and radio its data back to astronomers on the ground. The
first such orbiting infrared observatory, the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS), was launched in 1983. During its nine-month
mission, IRAS used its 57-cm (22-in.) telescope to map almost the
entire sky at wavelengths from 12 to 100 ␮m.
The IRAS data revealed the presence of dust disks around
nearby stars. Planets are thought to coalesce from disks of this
kind, so this was the first concrete (if indirect) evidence that there
might be planets orbiting other stars. The dust that IRAS detected
is warm enough to emit infrared radiation but too cold to emit
much visible light, so it remained undetected by ordinary optical
telescopes. IRAS also discovered distant, ultraluminous galaxies
that emit almost all their radiation at infrared wavelengths.
In 1995 the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO), a more advanced 60-cm reflector with better light detectors, was launched
into orbit by the European Space Agency. During its 21⁄2-year
mission, ISO made a number of groundbreaking observations of
very distant galaxies and of the thin, cold material between the
stars of our own Galaxy. Like IRAS, ISO had to be cooled by liquid helium to temperatures just a few degrees above absolute
zero. Had this not been done, the infrared blackbody radiation
from the telescope itself would have outshone the infrared radiation from astronomical objects. The ISO mission came to an end
when the last of the helium evaporated into space.

At the time of this writing the largest orbiting infrared
observatory is the Spitzer Space Telescope, an 85-cm
infrared telescope designed to survey the infrared sky
with unprecedented resolution (Figure 6-26). Placed in orbit in
2003, the Spitzer Space Telescope is being used to study the formation of new stars, probe the inner structure of galaxies, and
examine the first galaxies that formed after the Big Bang. The images that open this chapter illustrate how Spitzer can reveal aspects of astronomical objects that are hidden from visible-light
telescopes.

Water vapor is the main absorber of infrared radiation from
space, which is why infrared observatories are located at sites
with exceptionally low humidity. The site must also be at high altitude to get above as much of the atmosphere’s water vapor as
possible. One site that meets both criteria is the summit of Mauna
Kea in Hawaii, shown in Figure 6-16. (The complete lack of vegetation on the summit attests to its extreme dryness.) Some of the
telescopes on Mauna Kea are designed exclusively for detecting
infrared radiation. Others, such as the Keck I and Keck II telescopes, are used for both visible and near-infrared observations
(see Figure 6-18).

The Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE),
which went into orbit in 1999, specializes in measuring spectra at wavelengths from 90 to 120 nm.
Highly ionized oxygen atoms, which can exist only in an extremely high-temperature gas, have a characteristic spectral
line in this range. By looking for this spectral line in various
parts of the sky, FUSE has confirmed that our Milky Way
Galaxy (Section 1-4) is surrounded by an immense “halo” of
gas at temperatures in excess of 200,000 K. Only an ultraviolet telescope could have detected this “halo,” which is thought
to have been produced by exploding stars called supernovae
(Section 1-3).

The Spitzer Space Telescope Launched in 2003, this is the largest
infrared telescope ever placed in space. Its 85-cm objective mirror and

3 to 180 ␮m. The background to this illustration of the telescope is a
false-color Spitzer image of the Milky Way and the constellation Orion at

Ultraviolet Astronomy
Astronomers are also very interested in observing at ultraviolet
wavelengths. These observations can reveal a great deal about hot
stars, ionized clouds of gas between the stars, and the Sun’s hightemperature corona (see Section 3-5), all of which emit copious
amounts of ultraviolet light. The spectrum of ultraviolet sunlight
reflected from a planet can also reveal the composition of the
planet’s atmosphere. However, Earth’s atmosphere is opaque to
ultraviolet light except for the narrow near-ultraviolet range,
which extends from about 400 nm (the violet end of the visible
spectrum) down to 300 nm.
To see shorter-wavelength far-ultraviolet light, astronomers
must again make their observations from space. The first ultravi-

Infrared and ultraviolet satellites give excellent views of the heavens at selected wavelengths. But since the 1940s astronomers had
dreamed of having one large telescope that could be operated at
any wavelength from the near-infrared through the visible range
and out into the ultraviolet. This is the mission of the Hubble
Space Telescope (HST), which was placed in a 600-km-high orbit by the space shuttle Discovery in 1990 (Figure 6-28). HST has
a 2.4-meter (7.9-ft) objective mirror and was designed to observe
at wavelengths from 115 nm to 1 ␮m. Like most ground-based
telescopes, HST uses a CCD to record images. (In fact, the development of HST helped drive advances in CCD technology.) The
images are then radioed back to Earth in digital form.
The great promise of HST was that from its vantage point
high above the atmosphere, its angular resolution would be limited only by diffraction. But soon after HST was placed in orbit,
astronomers discovered that a manufacturing error had caused
the telescope’s objective mirror to suffer from spherical aberration. The mirror should have been able to concentrate 70% of a
star’s light into an image with an angular diameter of 0.1 arcsec.
Instead, only 20% of the light was focused into this small area.
The remainder was smeared out over an area about 1 arcsec wide,
giving images little better than those achieved at major groundbased observatories.
On an interim basis, astronomers used only the 20% of incoming starlight that was properly focused and, with computer
processing, discarded the remaining poorly focused 80%. This
was practical only for brighter objects on which astronomers
could afford to waste light. But many of the observing projects
scheduled for HST involved extremely dim galaxies and nebulae.
These problems were resolved by a second space shuttle mission in 1993. Astronauts installed a set of small secondary mirrors whose curvature exactly compensated for the error in
curvature of the primary mirror. Once these were in place, HST
was able to make truly sharp images of extremely faint objects.
Astronomers have used the repaired HST to make discoveries
about the nature of planets, the evolution of stars, the inner

The success of HST has inspired plans for its larger
successor, the James Webb Space Telescope or JWST
(Figure 6-29). Planned for a 2013 launch, JWST will
observe at visible and infrared wavelengths from 600 nm to 28
␮m. With its 6.5-m objective mirror—2.5 times the diameter of
the HST objective mirror, with six times the light-gathering
power—JWST will study faint objects such as planetary systems
forming around other stars and galaxies near the limit of the observable universe. Unlike HST, which is in a relatively low-altitude orbit around the Earth, JWST will orbit the Sun some 1.5
million km beyond the Earth. In this orbit the telescope’s view
will not be blocked by the Earth. Furthermore, by remaining far
from the radiant heat of the Earth it will be easier to keep JWST
at the very cold temperatures required by its infrared detectors.

X-Ray Astronomy
Space telescopes have also made it possible to explore objects
whose temperatures reach the almost inconceivable values of 106
to 108 K. Atoms in such a high-temperature gas move so fast that
when they collide, they emit X-ray photons of very high energy
and very short wavelengths less than 10 nm. X-ray telescopes designed to detect these photons must be placed in orbit, since
Earth’s atmosphere is totally opaque at these wavelengths.

CAUTION! X-ray telescopes work on a very different principle
from the X-ray devices used in medicine and dentistry. If you
have your foot “X rayed” to check for a broken bone, a piece of
photographic film (or an electronic detector) sensitive to X rays
is placed under your foot and an X-ray beam is directed at your
foot from above. The radiation penetrates through soft tissue but
not through bone, so the bones cast an “X-ray shadow” on the
film. A fracture will show as a break in the shadow. X-ray telescopes, by contrast, do not send beams of X rays toward astronomical objects in an attempt to see inside them. Rather, these
telescopes detect X rays that the objects emit on their own.
Astronomers got their first quick look at the X-ray sky from
brief rocket flights during the late 1940s. These observations
confirmed that the Sun’s corona (see Section 3-5) is a source of
X rays, and must therefore be at a temperature of millions of
kelvins. In 1962 a rocket experiment revealed that objects beyond
the solar system also emit X rays.
Since 1970, a series of increasingly sensitive and sophisticated
X-ray observatories have been placed in orbit, including NASA’s
Einstein Observatory, the European Space Agency’s Exosat, and
the German-British-American ROSAT. These telescopes have
shown that other stars also have high-temperature coronae, and
have found hot, X-ray-emitting gas clouds so immense that hundreds of galaxies fit inside them. They also discovered unusual
stars that emit X rays in erratic bursts. These bursts are now
thought to be coming from heated gas swirling around a small
but massive object—possibly a black hole.
X-ray astronomy took a quantum leap forward in 1999 with
the launch of NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory and the European Space Agency’s XMM-Newton. Named for the IndianAmerican astrophysicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, Chandra
can view the X-ray sky with an angular resolution of 0.5 arcsec
(Figure 6-30a). This is comparable to the best ground-based optical telescopes, and more than a thousand times better than the
resolution of the first orbiting X-ray telescope. Chandra can also
measure X-ray spectra 100 times more precisely than any previous spacecraft and can detect variations in X-ray emissions on
time scales as short as 16 microseconds. This latter capability is
essential for understanding how X-ray bursts are produced around
black holes.
XMM-Newton (for X-ray Multi-mirror Mission) is actually
three X-ray telescopes that all point in the same direction (Figure
6-30b). Their combined light-gathering power is five times greater
than that of Chandra, which makes XMM-Newton able to observe
fainter objects. (For reasons of economy, the mirrors were not
ground as precisely as those on Chandra, so the angular resolution of XMM-Newton is only about 6 arcseconds.) It also carries
a small but highly capable telescope for ultraviolet and visible observations. Hot X-ray sources are usually accompanied by cooler
material that radiates at these longer wavelengths, so XMMNewton can observe these hot and cool regions simultaneously.

Like X rays, gamma rays do not penetrate Earth’s atmosphere, so space telescopes are required. One of the most important gamma-ray telescopes placed in orbit to date is the Compton
Gamma Ray Observatory (CGRO), shown in Figure 6-31. One
particularly important task for CGRO was the study of gammaray bursts, which are brief, unpredictable, and very intense flashes
of gamma rays that are found in all parts of the sky. By analyzing data from CGRO and other orbiting observatories, astronomers have shown that the sources of these gamma-ray bursts
are billions of light-years away. For these bursts to be visible
across such great distances, their sources must be among the most
energetic objects in the universe. By combining these gamma-ray
observations with images made by optical telescopes, astronomers
have found that at least some of the gamma-ray bursts emanate
from stars that explode catastrophically. Since the CGRO mission
ended in 2000, more advanced gamma-ray telescopes, including
the European Space Agency’s INTEGRAL (International GammaRay Astrophysics Laboratory), have taken its place.
The Cosmic Connections figure shows the wavelengths at
which Earth-orbiting telescopes are particularly useful, as well as
summarizing the design of refracting and reflecting Earth-based
telescopes. The advantages and benefits of Earth-orbiting observatories cannot be overemphasized. We are no longer limited to
the narrow ranges of whatever wavelengths manage to leak
through our shimmering, hazy atmosphere (Figure 6-32). For the
first time, we are really seeing the universe.

have been warmed by starlight. (d) The X-ray view from ROSAT shows
wavelengths of 0.8 nm (blue), 1.7 nm (green), and 5.0 nm (red),
corresponding to photon energies of 1500, 750, and 250 eV. Extremely
high temperature gas emits these X rays. The white regions, which emit
strongly at all X-ray wavelengths, are remnants of supernovae. (e) The
gamma-ray view from the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory includes all
wavelengths less than about 1.2 ⫻ 10⫺5 nm (photon energies greater
than 108 eV). The diffuse radiation from the Milky Way is emitted when
fast-moving subatomic particles collide with the nuclei of atoms in
interstellar gas clouds. The bright spots above and below the Milky Way
are distant, extremely energetic galaxies.

Today, telescopes can view the universe in every range of
electromagnetic radiation, although some must be above Earth's
atmosphere to receive radiation without interference.

Charge-Coupled Devices: Sensitive light detectors called chargecoupled devices (CCDs) are often used at a telescope’s focus to
record faint images.
Spectrographs: A spectrograph uses a diffraction grating to form
the spectrum of an astronomical object.
Radio Telescopes: Radio telescopes use large reflecting dishes to
focus radio waves onto a detector.
• Very large dishes provide reasonably sharp radio images. Higher
resolution is achieved with interferometry techniques that link
smaller dishes together.
Transparency of the Earth’s Atmosphere: The Earth’s atmosphere
absorbs much of the radiation that arrives from space.
• The atmosphere is transparent chiefly in two wavelength ranges
known as the optical window and the radio window. A few wavelengths in the near-infrared also reach the ground.
Telescopes in Space: For observations at wavelengths to which
the Earth’s atmosphere is opaque, astronomers depend on telescopes carried above the atmosphere by rockets or spacecraft.
• Satellite-based observatories provide new information about the
universe and permit coordinated observation of the sky at all
wavelengths.

Questions

Key Ideas
Refracting Telescopes: Refracting telescopes, or refractors, produce images by bending light rays as they pass through glass
lenses.
• Chromatic aberration is an optical defect whereby light of different wavelengths is bent in different amounts by a lens.
• Glass impurities, chromatic aberration, opacity to certain wavelengths, and structural difficulties make it inadvisable to build extremely large refractors.
Reflecting Telescopes: Reflecting telescopes, or reflectors, produce images by reflecting light rays to a focus point from curved
mirrors.
• Reflectors are not subject to most of the problems that limit the
useful size of refractors.
Angular Resolution: A telescope’s angular resolution, which indicates ability to see fine details, is limited by two key factors.
• Diffraction is an intrinsic property of light waves. Its effects can
be minimized by using a larger objective lens or mirror.
• The blurring effects of atmospheric turbulence can be minimized by placing the telescope atop a tall mountain with very
smooth air. They can be dramatically reduced by the use of adaptive optics and can be eliminated entirely by placing the telescope
in orbit.

Planetology I:
Our Solar
System

ifty years ago, astronomers knew precious little about the
worlds that orbit the Sun. Even the best telescopes provided
images of the planets that were frustratingly hazy and indistinct. Of asteroids, comets, and the satellites of the planets, we
knew even less.
Today, our knowledge of the solar system has grown exponentially, due almost entirely to robotic spacecraft. (The illustration shows an artist’s impression of one such robotic explorer, the
Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft, as it approached Mars in
2006.) Spacecraft have been sent to fly past all the planets at close
range, revealing details unimagined by astronomers of an earlier
generation. We have landed spacecraft on the Moon, Venus, and
Mars and dropped a probe into the immense atmosphere of Jupiter.
This is truly the golden age of solar system exploration.
In this chapter we paint in broad outline our present understanding of the solar system. We will see that the planets come in
a variety of sizes and chemical compositions. There is also rich
variety among the moons of the planets and among smaller bodies we call asteroids, comets, and trans-Neptunian objects. We
will investigate the nature of craters on the Moon and other
worlds of the solar system. And by exploring the magnetic fields

of planets, we will be able to peer inside the Earth and other
worlds and learn about their interior compositions.
An important reason to study the solar system is to search for
our own origins. In Chapter 8 we will see how astronomers have
used evidence from the present-day solar system to understand
how the Sun, the Earth, and the other planets formed some four
and a half billion years ago, and how they have evolved since
then. But for now, we invite you to join us on a guided tour of
the worlds that orbit our Sun.

7-1 The solar system has two
broad categories of planets:
Earthlike and Jupiterlike
Each of the planets that orbit the Sun is unique. Only Earth has
liquid water and an atmosphere breathable by humans; only
Venus has a perpetual cloud layer made of sulfuric acid droplets;
and only Jupiter has immense storm systems that persist for
centuries. But there are also striking similarities among planets.

planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars) are crowded in close
to the Sun. In contrast, the orbits of the next four planets (Jupiter,
Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) are widely spaced at great distances from the Sun. Table 7-1 lists the orbital characteristics of
these eight planets.

Volcanoes are found not only on Earth but also on Venus and
Mars; rings encircle Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune; and

How can we make sense of the
similarities and
many similarities and differences
among the planets? An important differences among the
step is to organize our knowledge of planets by comparing
the planets in a systematic way. their orbits, masses,
There are two useful ways to do this. and diameters
First, we can contrast the orbits of
different planets around the Sun; and second, we can compare the
planets’ physical properties such as diameter, mass, average density, and chemical composition.

CAUTION! While Figure 7-1 shows the orbits of the planets, it
does not show the planets themselves. The reason is simple: If
Jupiter, the largest of the planets, were to be drawn to the same
scale as the rest of this figure, it would be a dot just 0.0002 cm
across—about 1/300 of the width of a human hair and far too
small to be seen without a microscope. The planets themselves
are very small compared to the distances between them. Indeed,
while an airliner traveling at 1000 km/h (620 mi/h) can fly
around the Earth in less than two days, at this speed it would
take 17 years to fly from the Earth to the Sun. The solar system
is a very large and very empty place!

Comparing the Planets: Orbits

Most of the planets have orbits that are nearly circular. As
we learned in Section 4-4, Kepler discovered in the seventeenth

century that these orbits are actually ellipses. Astronomers denote
the elongation of an ellipse by its eccentricity (see Figure 4-10b).
The eccentricity of a circle is zero, and indeed most of the eight
planets (with the notable exception of Mercury) have orbital eccentricities that are very close to zero.
If you could observe the solar system from a point several astronomical units (AU) above the Earth’s north pole, you would
see that all the planets orbit the Sun in the same counterclockwise
direction. Furthermore, the orbits of the eight planets all lie in
nearly the same plane. In other words, these orbits are inclined at
only slight angles to the plane of the ecliptic, which is the plane
of the Earth’s orbit around the Sun (see Section 2-5). What is
more, the plane of the Sun’s equator is very closely aligned with
the orbital planes of the planets. As we will see in Chapter 8,
these near-alignments are not a coincidence. They provide important clues about the origin of the solar system.
Not included in Figure 7-1 or Table 7-1 is Pluto, which is in
an even larger orbit than Neptune. Until the late 1990s, Pluto was
generally regarded as the ninth planet. But in light of recent discoveries many astronomers now consider Pluto to be simply one
member of a large collection of trans-Neptunian objects that orbit far from the Sun. These all orbit the Sun in the same direction
as the planets, though many of them have orbits that are steeply
inclined to the plane of the ecliptic and have high eccentricities
(that is, the orbits are quite elongated and noncircular). We will
discuss trans-Neptunian objects, along with other small bodies
that orbit the Sun, in Section 7-5.

Comparing the Planets: Physical Properties
When we compare the physical properties of the planets, we again
find that they fall naturally into two classes—four small inner
planets and four large outer ones. The four small inner planets
are called terrestrial planets because they resemble the Earth (in
Latin, terra). They all have hard, rocky surfaces with mountains,
craters, valleys, and volcanoes. You could stand on the surface of
any one of them, although you would need a protective spacesuit
on Mercury, Venus, or Mars. The four large outer planets are
called Jovian planets because they resemble Jupiter. (Jove was an-

Mercury
Venus
Earth
Mars

other name for the Roman god Jupiter.) An attempt to land a
spacecraft on the surface of any of the Jovian planets would be
futile, because the materials of which these planets are made are
mostly gaseous or liquid. The visible “surface” features of a Jovian planet are actually cloud formations in the planet’s atmosphere. The photographs in Figure 7-2 show the distinctive
appearances of the two classes of planets.
The most apparent difference between the terrestrial and Jovian planets is their diameters. You can compute the diameter of
a planet if you know its angular diameter as seen from Earth and
its distance from Earth. For example, on March 16, 2007, Venus
was 1.97 ⫻ 108 km from Earth and had an angular diameter of
12.7 arcsec. Using the small-angle formula from Box 1-1, we can
calculate the diameter of Venus to be 12,100 km (7520 mi). Similar calculations demonstrate that the Earth, with its diameter of
about 12,756 km (7926 mi), is the largest of the four inner, terrestrial planets. In sharp contrast, the four outer, Jovian planets
are much larger than the terrestrial planets. First place goes to
Jupiter, whose equatorial diameter is more than 11 times that of
the Earth. On the other end of the scale, Mercury’s diameter is
less than two-fifths that of the Earth. Figure 7-2 shows the Sun
and the planets drawn to the same scale. The diameters of the
planets are given in Table 7-1.
The masses of the terrestrial and Jovian planets are also dramatically different. If a planet has a satellite, you can calculate the
planet’s mass from the satellite’s period and semimajor axis by using Newton’s form of Kepler’s third law (see Section 4-7 and Box
4-4). Astronomers have also measured the mass of each planet by
sending a spacecraft to pass near the planet. The planet’s gravitational pull (which is proportional to its mass) deflects the spacecraft’s path, and the amount of deflection tells us the planet’s
mass. Using these techniques, astronomers have found that the
four Jovian planets have masses that are tens or hundreds of times
greater than the mass of any of the terrestrial planets. Again, first
place goes to Jupiter, whose mass is 318 times greater than the
Earth’s.
Once we know the diameter and mass of a planet, we can
learn something about what that planet is made of. The trick is
to calculate the planet’s average density, or mass divided by vol-

The Heavens on the Earth

Average Density
verage density—the mass of an object divided by that object’s volume—is a useful quantity for describing the difA
ferences between planets in our solar system. This same
quantity has many applications here on Earth.
A rock tossed into a lake sinks to the bottom, while an air
bubble produced at the bottom of a lake (for example, by the
air tanks of a scuba diver) rises to the top. These are examples
of a general principle: An object sinks in a fluid if its average
density is greater than that of the fluid, but rises if its average
density is less than that of the fluid. The average density of water is 1000 kg/m3, which is why a typical rock (with an average density of about 3000 kg/m3) sinks, while an air bubble
(average density of about 1.2 kg/m3) rises.
At many summer barbecues, cans of soft drinks are kept
cold by putting them in a container full of ice. When the ice
melts, the cans of diet soda always rise to the top, while the
cans of regular soda sink to the bottom. Why is this? The average density of a can of diet soda—which includes water, flavoring, artificial sweetener, and the trapped gas that makes the
drink fizzy—is slightly less than the density of water, and so

ume, measured in kilograms per cubic meter (kg/m3). The average density of any substance depends in part on that substance’s
composition. For example, air near sea level on Earth has an average density of 1.2 kg/m3, water’s average density is 1000 kg/m3,
and a piece of concrete has an average density of 2000 kg/m3.
Box 7-1 describes some applications of the idea of average density to everyday phenomena on Earth.
The four inner, terrestrial planets have very high average densities (see Table 7-1); the average density of the Earth, for example, is 5515 kg/m3. By contrast, a typical rock found on the
Earth’s surface has a lower average density, about 3000 kg/m3.
Thus, the Earth must contain a large amount of material that is
denser than rock. This information provides our first clue that
terrestrial planets have dense iron cores.
In sharp contrast, the outer, Jovian planets have quite low
densities. Saturn has an average density less than that of water.
This information strongly suggests that the giant outer planets are
composed primarily of light elements such as hydrogen and helium. All four Jovian planets probably have large cores of mixed
rock and highly compressed water buried beneath low-density
outer layers tens of thousands of kilometers thick.
We can conclude that the following general rule applies to
the planets:
The terrestrial planets are made of rocky materials and have
dense iron cores, which gives these planets high average
densities. The Jovian planets are composed primarily of light
elements such as hydrogen and helium, which gives these
planets low average densities.

the can floats. A can of regular soda contains sugar instead of
artificial sweetener, and the sugar is a bit heavier than the
sweetener. The extra weight is just enough to make the average density of a can of regular soda slightly more than that of
water, making the can sink. (You can test these statements for
yourself by putting unopened cans of diet soda and regular
soda in a sink or bathtub full of water.)
The concept of average density provides geologists with
important clues about the early history of the Earth. The average density of surface rocks on Earth, about 3000 kg/m3, is
less than the Earth’s average density of 5515 kg/m3. The simplest explanation is that in the ancient past, the Earth was
completely molten throughout its volume, so that low-density
materials rose to the surface and high-density materials sank
deep into the Earth’s interior in a process called chemical differentiation. This series of events also suggests that the Earth’s
core must be made of relatively dense materials, such as iron
and nickel. A tremendous amount of other geological evidence
has convinced scientists that this picture is correct.

7-2 Seven large satellites are almost as
big as the terrestrial planets
All the planets except Mercury and Venus have satellites. More
than 140 satellites are known: Earth has one (the Moon), Mars
has two, Jupiter has at least 62, Saturn at least 43, Uranus at least
24, and Neptune at least 13. Dozens of other small satellites
probably remain to be discovered as our telescope technology
continues to improve. Like the terrestrial planets, all of the satellites of The various moons of the
the planets have solid surfaces.
planets are not simply
You can see that there is a strikcopies of the Earth’s
ing difference between the terrestrial
planets, with few or no satellites, and Moon
the Jovian planets, each of which has
so many moons that it resembles a solar system in miniature. In
Chapter 8 we will explore this and other evidence that the Jovian
planets formed in a manner similar to the solar system as a whole,
but on a smaller scale.
Of the known satellites, seven are roughly as big as the
planet Mercury. Table 7-2 lists these satellites and shows them
to the same scale. Note that the Earth’s Moon and Jupiter’s satellites Io and Europa have relatively high average densities, indicating that these satellites are made primarily of rocky materials.
By contrast, the average densities of Ganymede, Callisto, Titan,
and Triton are all relatively low. Planetary scientists conclude that
the interiors of these four satellites also contain substantial amounts
of water ice, which is less dense than rock. (In Section 7-4 we

will learn about types of frozen “ice” made of substances other
than water.)

CAUTION! Water ice may seem like a poor material for building a satellite, since the ice you find in your freezer can easily be
cracked or crushed. But under high pressure, such as is found in
the interior of a large satellite, water ice becomes as rigid as
rock. (It also becomes denser than the ice found in ice cubes, although not as dense as rock.) Note that water ice is an important constituent only for satellites in the outer solar system,
where the Sun is far away and temperatures are very low. For
example, the surface temperature of Titan is a frigid 95 K
(⫺178°C ⫽ ⫺288°F). In Section 7-4 we will learn more about
the importance of temperature in determining the composition
of a planet or satellite.
The satellites listed in Table 7-2 are actually unusually large.
Most of the known satellites have diameters less than 2000 km,
and many are just a few kilometers across.
Interplanetary spacecraft have made many surprising and fascinating discoveries about the satellites of the solar system. We
now know that Jupiter’s satellite Io is the most geologically active
world in the solar system, with numerous geyserlike volcanoes
that continually belch forth sulfur-rich compounds. The fractured
surface of Europa, another of Jupiter’s large satellites, suggests
that a worldwide ocean of liquid water may lie beneath its icy surface. Saturn’s largest satellite, Titan, has an atmosphere nearly
twice as dense as the Earth’s atmosphere, with a perpetual haze
layer that gives it a featureless appearance (see the photographs
in Table 7-2).

7-3 Spectroscopy reveals the chemical
composition of the planets
As we have seen, the average densities of the planets and satellites
give us a crude measure of their chemical compositions—that is,
what substances they are made of. For example, the low average
density of the Moon (3340 kg/m3) compared with the Earth (5515
kg/m3) tells us that the Moon contains relatively little iron or
other dense metals. But to truly understand the nature of the planets The light we receive from
and satellites, we need to know their a planet or satellite is

greater detail than we can learn from

average density alone.
The most accurate way to deter- differences in its
mine chemical composition is by di- spectrum
rectly analyzing samples taken from
a planet’s atmosphere and soil. Unfortunately, of all the planets
and satellites, we have such direct information only for the Earth
and the three worlds on which spacecraft have landed—Venus,
the Moon, and Mars. In all other cases, astronomers must analyze sunlight reflected from the distant planets and their satellites.
To do that, astronomers bring to bear one of their most powerful tools, spectroscopy, the systematic study of spectra and spectral lines. (We discussed spectroscopy in Sections 5-6 and 6-5.)

Determining Atmospheric Composition
Spectroscopy is a sensitive probe of the composition of a planet’s
atmosphere. If a planet has an atmosphere, then sunlight re-

Comparative Planetology I: Our Solar System

Figure 7-3b is produced. Only the two dips near 620 nm and
730 nm are caused by gases in Titan’s atmosphere.
These two absorption lines are caused not by individual atoms
in the atmosphere of Titan but by atoms combined to form molecules. (We introduced the idea of molecules in Section 5-6.) Molecules, like atoms, also produce unique patterns of lines in the
spectra of astronomical objects. The absorption lines in Figure
7-3b indicate the presence in Titan’s atmosphere of molecules of
methane (CH4, a molecule made of one carbon atom and four hydrogen atoms). This shows that Titan is a curious place indeed,
because on Earth, methane is a rather rare substance that is the
primary ingredient in natural gas! When we examine other planets and satellites with atmospheres, we find that all of their spectra have absorption lines of molecules of various types.
In addition to visible-light measurements such as those shown
in Figure 7-3b, it is very useful to study the infrared and ultraviolet spectra of planetary atmospheres. Many molecules have much
stronger spectral lines in these nonvisible wavelength bands than
in the visible. As an example, the ultraviolet spectrum of Titan
shows that nitrogen molecules (N2) are the dominant constituent
of Titan’s atmosphere. Furthermore, Titan’s infrared spectrum

Intensity

flected from that planet must have passed through its atmosphere. During this passage, some of the wavelengths of sunlight
will have been absorbed. Hence, the spectrum of this reflected
sunlight will have dark absorption lines. Astronomers look at the
particular wavelengths absorbed and the amount of light absorbed at those wavelengths. Both of these depend on the kinds
of chemicals present in the planet’s atmosphere and the abundance of those chemicals.
For example, astronomers have used spectroscopy to analyze
the atmosphere of Saturn’s largest satellite, Titan (see Figure 7-3a
and Table 7-2). The graph in Figure 7-3b shows the spectrum of
visible sunlight reflected from Titan. (We first saw this method of
displaying spectra in Figure 6-21.) The dips in this curve of intensity versus wavelength represent absorption lines. However, not
all of these absorption lines are produced in the atmosphere of Titan (Figure 7-3c). Before reaching Titan, light from the Sun’s
glowing surface must pass through the Sun’s hydrogen-rich atmosphere. This produces the hydrogen absorption line in Figure
7-3b at a wavelength of 656 nm. After being reflected from Titan, the light must pass through the Earth’s atmosphere before
reaching the telescope; this is where the oxygen absorption line in

includes spectral lines of a variety of molecules that contain carbon and hydrogen, indicating that Titan’s atmosphere has a very
complex chemistry. None of these molecules could have been detected by visible light alone. Since the Earth’s atmosphere is largely
opaque to infrared and ultraviolet wavelengths (see Section 6-7),
telescopes in space are important tools for these spectroscopic
studies of the solar system.
It is a testament to the power of spectroscopy that when the
robotic spacecraft Huygens landed on Titan in 2005, its onboard
instruments confirmed the presence of methane and nitrogen in
Titan’s atmosphere—just as had been predicted years before by
spectroscopic observations.

inant constituent of Europa’s interior, because this satellite’s density is too high.)
Unfortunately, spectroscopy tells us little about what the material is like just below the surface of a satellite or planet. For this
purpose, there is simply no substitute for sending a spacecraft to
a planet and examining its surface directly.

Determining Surface Composition

Spectroscopic observations from Earth and spacecraft show that
the outer layers of the Jovian planets are composed primarily of
the lightest gases, hydrogen and helium (see Box 5-5). In contrast,
chemical analysis of soil samples from Venus, Earth, and Mars
demonstrate that the terrestrial planets are made mostly of heavier elements, such as iron, oxygen,
silicon, magnesium, nickel, and sul- Differences in distance

these striking differences in chemical
composition, which are summarized many distinctions
between terrestrial and
in Table 7-3.
Temperature plays a major role Jovian planets
in determining whether the materials of which planets are made exist as solids, liquids, or gases. Hydrogen (H2) and helium (He) are gaseous except at extremely low
temperatures and extraordinarily high pressures. By contrast,
rock-forming substances such as iron and silicon are solids except

Spectroscopy can also provide useful information about the solid
surfaces of planets and satellites without atmospheres. When light
shines on a solid surface, some wavelengths are absorbed while
others are reflected. (For example, a plant leaf absorbs red and
violet light but reflects green light—which is why leaves look
green.) Unlike a gas, a solid illuminated by sunlight does not produce sharp, definite spectral lines. Instead, only broad absorption
features appear in the spectrum. By comparing such a spectrum
with the spectra of samples of different substances on Earth, astronomers can infer the chemical composition of the surface of a
planet or satellite.
As an example, Figure 7-4a shows Jupiter’s satellite Europa
(see Table 7-2), and Figure 7-4b shows the infrared spectrum of
light reflected from the surface of Europa. Because this spectrum
is so close to that of water ice—that is, frozen water—astronomers
conclude that water ice is the dominant constituent of Europa’s
surface. (We saw in Section 7-2 that water ice cannot be the dom-

at temperatures well above 1000 K. (You may want to review the
discussion of temperature scales in Box 5-1.) Between these two
extremes are substances such as water (H2O), carbon dioxide
(CO2), methane (CH4), and ammonia (NH3), which solidify at
low temperatures (from below 100 to 300 K) into solids called
ices. (In astronomy, frozen water is just one kind of “ice.”) At
somewhat higher temperatures, they can exist as liquids or gases.
For example, clouds of ammonia ice crystals are found in the cold
upper atmosphere of Jupiter, but within Jupiter’s warmer interior,
ammonia exists primarily as a liquid.

CAUTION! The Jovian planets are sometimes called “gas giants.” It is true that their primary constituents, including hydrogen, helium, ammonia, and methane, are gases under
normal conditions on Earth. But in the interiors of these planets, pressures are so high that these substances are liquids, not
gases. The Jovian planets might be better described as “liquid
giants”!
As you might expect, a planet’s surface temperature is related
to its distance from the Sun. The four inner planets are quite
warm. For example, midday temperatures on Mercury may climb
to 700 K (⫽ 427°C ⫽ 801°F), and during midsummer on Mars,
it is sometimes as warm as 290 K (⫽ 17°C ⫽ 63°F). The outer

This expression for kinetic energy is valid for all objects,
both big and small, from atoms and molecules to planets and
stars, as long as their speeds are slow in relation to the speed
of light. If the mass is expressed in kilograms and the speed in
meters per second, the kinetic energy is expressed in joules (J).

Consider a gas, such as the atmosphere of a star or
planet. Some of the gas atoms or molecules will be moving
slowly, with little kinetic energy, while others will be moving
faster and have more kinetic energy. The temperature of the
gas is a direct measure of the average amount of kinetic
energy per atom or molecule. The hotter the gas, the faster
atoms or molecules move, on average, and the greater the
average kinetic energy of an atom or molecule.
If the gas temperature is sufficiently high, typically
several thousand kelvins, molecules move so fast that when
they collide with one another, the energy of the collision
can break the molecules apart into their constituent atoms.
Thus, the Sun’s atmosphere, where the temperature is
5800 K, consists primarily of individual hydrogen atoms
rather than hydrogen molecules. By contrast, the hydrogen
atoms in the Earth’s atmosphere (temperature 290 K) are
combined with oxygen atoms into molecules of water
vapor (H2O).

Instead, the atmospheres of Venus, Earth, and Mars are composed
of heavier molecules such as nitrogen (N2, 14 times more massive
than a hydrogen molecule), oxygen (O2, 16 times more massive),
and carbon dioxide (22 times more massive). To understand the
connection between surface temperature and the absence of hydrogen and helium, we need to know a few basic facts about gases.

The quantity k is called the Boltzmann constant. Note
that the higher the gas temperature, the greater the average
kinetic energy of an atom or molecule of the gas. This
average kinetic energy becomes zero at absolute zero, or
T ⫽ 0, the temperature at which molecular motion is at a
minimum.
At a given temperature, all kinds of atoms and molecules
will have the same average kinetic energy. But the average
speed of a given kind of atom or molecule depends on its
mass. To see this, note that the average kinetic energy of a
gas atom or molecule can be written in two equivalent ways:

The temperature of a gas is directly related to the speeds at

slightly higher than the average speed of the atoms or

A good rule of thumb is that a planet can retain a gas if
the escape speed is at least 6 times greater than the average
speed of the molecules in the gas. (Some molecules are moving
slower than average, and others are moving faster, but very
few are moving more than 6 times faster than average.) In such
a case, very few molecules will be moving fast enough to escape from the planet’s gravity.

Answer: To use the equation to calculate the average speed v,
we must express the temperature T in kelvins (K) rather than
degrees Celsius (°C). As we learned in Box 5-1, we do this
by adding 273 to the Celsius temperature, so 20°C becomes

Review: This is about 1700 kilometers per hour, or about
1100 miles per hour. Hence, atoms and molecules move
rapidly in even a moderate-temperature gas.
In some situations, atoms and molecules in a gas may be
moving so fast that they can overcome the attractive force of
a planet’s gravity and escape into interplanetary space. The
minimum speed that an object at a planet’s surface must have
in order to permanently leave the planet is called the planet’s
escape speed. The escape speed for a planet of mass M and radius R is given by

they can escape from the relatively weak gravity of these planets.
Hence, the atmospheres that surround the terrestrial planets are
composed primarily of more massive, slower-moving molecules
such as CO2, N2, O2, and water vapor (H2O). On the four Jovian planets, low temperatures and relatively strong gravity pre-

EXAMPLE: Consider the Earth’s atmosphere. We saw that the
average speed of oxygen molecules is 0.478 km/s at room
temperature. The escape speed from the Earth (11.2 km/s) is
much more than 6 times the average speed of the oxygen
molecules, so the Earth has no trouble keeping oxygen in its
atmosphere.
A similar calculation for hydrogen molecules (H2) gives
a different result, however. At 293 K, the average speed of
a hydrogen molecule is 1.9 km/s. Six times this speed is
11.4 km/s, which is slightly higher than the escape speed
from the Earth. Thus, the Earth does not retain hydrogen in
its atmosphere. Any hydrogen released into the air slowly
leaks away into space. On Jupiter, by contrast, the escape
speed is so high that even the lightest gases such as hydrogen are retained in its atmosphere. But on Mercury the escape speed is low and the temperature high (so that gas
molecules move faster), so Mercury cannot retain any significant atmosphere at all.

vent even lightweight hydrogen and helium gases from escaping

The combined mass of Jupiter’s atmosphere, for example, is about
a million (106) times greater than that of the Earth’s atmosphere.
This is comparable to the mass of the entire Earth! Box 7-2 describes more about the ability of a planet’s gravity to retain gases.

7-5 Small chunks of rock and ice also

Asteroids

CAUTION! One common misconception about asteroids is that
they are the remnants of an ancient planet that somehow broke
apart or exploded, like the fictional planet Krypton in the comic
book adventures of Superman. In fact, the combined mass of the
asteroids is less than that of the Moon, and they were probably
never part of any planet-sized body. The early solar system is
thought to have been filled with asteroidlike objects, most of
which were incorporated into the planets. The “leftover” objects
that missed out on this process make up our present-day population of asteroids.

Trans-Neptunian Objects
While asteroids are the most important small bodies in the inner
solar system, the outer solar system is the realm of the transNeptunian objects. As the name suggests, these are small bodies
whose orbits lie beyond the orbit of Neptune. The first of these
to be discovered (1930) was Pluto, with a diameter of only
2274 km. This is larger than any asteroid, but smaller than any
planet or any of the satellites listed in Table 7-2. The orbit of
Pluto has a greater semimajor axis (39.54 AU), is more steeply
inclined to the ecliptic (17.15°), and has a greater eccentricity
(0.250) than that of any of the planets (Figure 7-8). In fact,
Pluto’s noncircular orbit sometimes takes it nearer the Sun than
Neptune. (Happily, the orbits of Neptune and Pluto are such that
they will never collide.) Pluto’s density is only 2000 kg/m3, about
the same as Neptune’s moon Triton, shown in Table 7-2. Hence,
its composition is thought to be a mixture of about 70% rock
and 30% ice.

Within the orbit of Jupiter are hundreds of thousands of rocky
objects called asteroids. There is no sharp dividing line between
planets and asteroids, which is why asteroids are also called
minor planets. The largest asteroid, Ceres, has a diameter of
about 900 km. The next largest, Pallas and Vesta, are each about
500 km in diameter. Still smaller ones, like the asteroid shown in
close-up in Figure 7-7, are increasingly numerous. Hundreds of
thousands of kilometer-sized asteroids are known, and there are
probably hundreds of thousands more that are boulder-sized or
smaller. All of these objects orbit the Sun in the same direction as
the planets.
Most (although not all) asteroids orbit the Sun at distances
of 2 to 3.5 AU. This region of the solar system between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter is called the asteroid belt.

In addition to the eight planets, many smaller objects orbit the
Sun. These fall into three broad categories: asteroids, which are rocky The smaller bodies of the
objects found in the inner solar sys- solar system contain

RI V UXG

An Asteroid The asteroid shown in this image, 433 Eros, is
only 33 km (21 mi) long and 13 km (8 mi) wide—about the
same size as the island of Manhattan. Because Eros is so small, its gravity
is too weak to have pulled it into a spherical shape. This image was taken
in March 2000 by NEAR Shoemaker, the first spacecraft to orbit around
and land on an asteroid. (NEAR Project, Johns Hopkins University, Applied
Physics Laboratory, and NASA)

Since 1992 astronomers have discovered more than 900
other trans-Neptunian objects, and are discovering more each
year. Like asteroids, all trans-Neptunian objects orbit the Sun in
the same direction as the planets. A handful of trans-Neptunian
objects are comparable in size to Pluto; at least one, Eris, is even
larger than Pluto, as well as being in an orbit that is much
larger, more steeply inclined, and more eccentric (Figure 7-8).
Table 7-4 lists the seven largest trans-Neptunian objects known
as of this writing. (Note that Charon is actually a satellite of
Pluto.)
Just as most asteroids lie in the asteroid belt, most transNeptunian objects orbit within a band called the Kuiper belt (pronounced “ki-per”) that extends from 30 AU to 50 AU from the
Sun and is centered on the plane of the ecliptic. Like asteroids,
many more trans-Neptunian objects remain to be discovered: astronomers estimate that there are 35,000 or more such objects
with diameters greater than 100 km. If so, the combined mass of
all trans-Neptunian objects is comparable to the mass of Jupiter,
and is several hundred times greater than the combined mass of
all the asteroids found in the inner solar system.
Like asteroids, trans-Neptunian objects are thought to be debris left over from the formation of the solar system. In the inner
regions of the solar system, rocky fragments have been able to endure continuous exposure to the Sun’s heat, but any ice originally
present would have evaporated. Far from the Sun, ice has survived for billions of years. Thus, debris in the solar system naturally divides into two families (asteroids and trans-Neptunian
objects), which can be arranged according to distance from the
Sun, just like the two categories of planets (terrestrial and Jovian).

Comets
Two objects in the Kuiper belt can collide if their orbits cross each
other. When this happens, a fragment a few kilometers across can
be knocked off one of the colliding objects and be diverted into
an elongated orbit that brings it close to the Sun. Such small

A Comet This photograph shows Comet Hale-Bopp as it
appeared in April 1997. The solid part of a comet like this is a
chunk of dirty ice a few tens of kilometers in diameter. When a comet

forming a bluish tail of gas and a white tail of dust. Both tails can extend

objects, each a combination of rock and ice, are called comets.
When a comet comes close enough to the Sun, the Sun’s radiation
vaporizes some of the comet’s ices, producing long flowing tails
of gas and dust particles (Figure 7-9). Astronomers deduce the
composition of comets by studying the spectra of these tails.

CAUTION! Science-fiction movies and television programs
sometimes show comets tearing across the night sky like a rocket.
That would be a pretty impressive sight—but that is not what
comets look like. Like the planets, comets orbit the Sun. And
like the planets, comets move hardly at all against the background of stars over the course of a single night (see Section
4-1). If you are lucky enough to see a bright comet, it will not
zoom dramatically from horizon to horizon. Instead, it will seem
to hang majestically among the stars, so you can admire it at
your leisure.
Some comets appear to originate from locations far beyond
the Kuiper belt. The source of these is thought to be a swarm of
comets that forms a spherical “halo” around the solar system
called the Oort cloud. This hypothesized “halo” extends to 50,000
AU from the Sun (about one-fifth of the way to the nearest other
star). Because the Oort cloud is so distant, it has not yet been possible to detect objects in the Oort cloud directly.

7-6 Cratering on planets and satellites
is the result of impacts from
interplanetary debris
One of the great challenges in studying planets and satellites is
how to determine their internal structures. Are they solid or liquid inside? If there is liquid in the interiors, is the liquid calm or

The planets orbit the Sun in roughly circular orbits. But many asteroids and comets are in more elongated orbits. Such an elongated orbit can put these small objects on a collision course with
a planet or satellite. If the object collides with a Jovian planet, it
is swallowed up by the planet’s thick atmosphere. (Astronomers
actually saw an event of this kind in 1994, when a comet crashed
into Jupiter.) But if the object collides with the solid surface of a
terrestrial planet or a satellite, the result is an impact crater (see
Figure 7-10). Such impact craters, found throughout the solar system, offer stark evidence of these violent collisions.
The easiest way to view impact craters is to examine the
Moon through a telescope or binoculars. Some 30,000 lunar
craters are visible, with diameters ranging from 1 km to several
hundred km. Close-up photographs from lunar orbit have revealed millions of craters too small to be seen from Earth (Figure
7-10a). These smaller craters are thought to have been caused by
impacts of relatively small objects called meteoroids, which range
in size from a few hundred meters across to the size of a pebble
or smaller. Meteoroids are the result of collisions between asteroids, whose orbits sometimes cross. The chunks of rock that result from these collisions go into independent orbits around the
Sun, which can lead them to collide with the Moon or another
world.
When German astronomer Franz Gruithuisen proposed in
1824 that lunar craters were the result of impacts, a major sticking point was the observation that nearly all craters are circular.
If craters were merely gouged out by high-speed rocks, a rock
striking the Moon in any direction except straight downward
would have created a noncircular crater. A century after
Gruithuisen, it was realized that a meteoroid colliding with the
Moon generates a shock wave in the lunar surface that spreads
out from the point of impact. Such a shock wave produces a circular crater no matter what direction the meteoroid was moving.
(In a similar way, the craters made by artillery shells are almost
always circular.) Many of the larger lunar craters also have a central peak, which is characteristic of a high-speed impact (see Figure 7-10a). Craters made by other processes, such as volcanic
action, would not have central peaks of this sort.

Comparing Cratering on Different Worlds
Not all planets and satellites show the same amount of cratering.
The Moon is heavily cratered over its entire surface, with craters
on top of craters, as shown in Figure 7-10a. On Earth, by contrast, craters are very rare: Geologists have identified fewer than
200 impact craters on our planet (Figure 7-10b). Our understanding is that both the Earth and the Moon formed at nearly the
same time and have been bombarded at comparable rates over

Impact Craters These images, all taken from spacecraft,
show impact craters on three different worlds. (a) The Moon’s
surface has craters of all sizes. The large crater near the middle of this
image is about 80 km (50 miles) in diameter, equal to the length of San
Francisco Bay. (b) Manicouagan Reservoir in Quebec is the relic of a crater
formed by an impact more than 200 million years ago. The crater was

eroded over the ages by the advance and retreat of glaciers, leaving a
ring lake 100 km (60 miles) across. (c) Lowell Crater in the southern
highlands of Mars is 201 km (125 miles) across. Like the image of the
Moon in part (a), there are craters on top of craters. Note the light-colored
frost formed by condensation of carbon dioxide from the Martian
atmosphere. (a: NASA; b: JSC/NASA; c: NASA/JPL/MSSS)

their history. Why, then, are craters so much rarer on the Earth
than on the Moon?
The answer is that the Earth is a geologically active planet:
the continents slowly change their positions over eons, new material flows onto the surface from the interior (as occurs in a volcanic eruption), and old surface material is pushed back into the
interior (as occurs off the coast of Chile, where the ocean bottom
is slowly being pushed beneath the South American continent).
These processes, coupled with erosion from wind and water,
cause craters on Earth to be erased over time. The few craters
found on Earth today must be relatively recent, since there has
not yet been time to erase them.
The Moon, by contrast, is geologically inactive. There are no
volcanoes and no motion of continents (and, indeed, no continents). Furthermore, the Moon has neither oceans nor an atmosphere, so there is no erosion as we know it on Earth. With none
of the processes that tend to erase craters on Earth, the Moon’s
surface remains pockmarked with the scars of billions of years of
impacts.
In order for a planet to be geologically active, its interior
must be at least partially molten. This is necessary so that continents can slide around on the underlying molten material and so
that molten lava can come to the surface, as in a volcanic eruption. Hence, we would expect geologically inactive (and hence
heavily cratered) worlds like the Moon to have less molten material in their interiors than does the Earth. Investigations of these
inactive worlds bear this out. But why is the Moon’s interior less
molten than the Earth’s?

relative to its volume, and so it can more easily lose heat to its
surroundings. A planet or satellite also tends to cool down as it
emits electromagnetic radiation into space (see Section 5-3); the
smaller the planet or satellite, the greater its surface area relative to its volume, and the more readily it can radiate away heat
(Figure 7-11). Both the Earth and Moon were probably completely molten when they first formed, but because the Moon
(diameter 3476 km) is so much smaller than the Earth (diameter 12,756 km), it has lost much of its internal heat and has a
much more solid interior.

ANALOGY To see one simple answer to this question, notice
that a large turkey or roast taken from the oven will stay warm
inside for hours, but a single meatball will cool off much more
rapidly. The reason is that the meatball has more surface area

Cratering Measures Geologic Activity
By considering these differences between the Earth and the Moon,
we have uncovered a general rule for worlds with solid surfaces:
The smaller the terrestrial world, the less internal heat it is
likely to have retained, and, thus, the less geologic activity it
will display on its surface. The less geologically active the
world, the older and hence more heavily cratered its surface.
This rule means that we can use the amount of cratering visible on a planet or satellite to estimate the age of its surface and
how geologically active it is. As an example, Mercury has a heavily cratered surface, which means that the surface is very old. This
accords with Mercury being the smallest of the terrestrial planets
(see Table 7-1): Due to its small size, it has lost the internal heat
required to sustain geologic activity. On Venus, by comparison,
there are only about a thousand craters larger than a few kilometers in diameter, many more than have been found on Earth but
only a small fraction of the number on the Moon or Mercury.
Venus is only slightly smaller than the Earth, and it has enough
internal heat to power the geologic activity required to erase most
of its impact craters.

Compared to planet #1, planet #2:
— has 1/2 the radius
— has 1/4 the surface area (so it can
lose heat only 1/4 as fast)
— but has only 1/8 the volume (so it
has only 1/8 as much heat to lose)
Hence compared to planet #1,
planet #2:
— will cool off more rapidly
— will sustain less geologic activity
— will have more craters

Planet #2

Figure 7-11
Planet Size and Cratering Of these two hypothetical planets, the
smaller one (#2) has less volume and less internal heat, as well as less
surface area from which to radiate heat into space. But the ratio of
surface area to volume is greater for the smaller planet. Hence, the
smaller planet will lose heat faster, have a colder interior, and be less
geologically active. It will also have a more heavily cratered surface, since
it takes geologic activity to erase craters.

Mars is an unusual case, in that extensive cratering (Figure
7-10c) is found only in the higher terrain; the lowlands of Mars
are remarkably smooth and free of craters. Thus, it follows that
the Martian highlands are quite old, while the lowlands have a
younger surface from which most craters have been erased. Considering the planet as a whole, the amount of cratering on Mars
is intermediate between that on Mercury and the Earth. This
agrees with our general rule, because Mars is intermediate in size
between Mercury and Earth. The interior of Mars was once hotter and more molten than it is now, so that geologic processes
were able to erase some of the impact craters. A key piece of evidence that supports this picture is that Mars has a number of immense volcanoes (Figure 7-12). These were active when Mars was
young, but as this relatively small planet cooled down and its interior solidified, the supply of molten material to the volcanoes
from the Martian interior was cut off. As a result, all of the volcanoes of Mars are now inactive.
As for all rules, there are limitations and exceptions to the
rule relating a world’s size to its geologic activity. One limitation
is that the four terrestrial planets all have slightly different compositions, which affects the types and extent of geologic activity
that can take place on their surfaces. This also complicates the relationship between the number of craters and the age of the surface. An important exception to our rule is Jupiter’s satellite Io,
which, despite its small size, is the most volcanic world in the solar system (see Section 7-2). Something must be supplying Io with
energy to keep its interior hot; this turns out to be Jupiter, which
exerts powerful tides on Io as it moves in a relatively small orbit
around its planet. These tides cause Io to flex like a ball of clay

being kneaded between your fingers, and this flexing heats up the
satellite’s interior. But despite these limitations and exceptions,
the relationships between a world’s size, internal heat, geologic
activity, and amount of cratering are powerful tools for understanding the terrestrial planets and satellites.

The needle of a compass on Earth points north because it
aligns with the Earth’s magnetic field. Such fields arise whenever
electrically charged particles are in motion. For example, a loop
of wire carrying an electric current generates a magnetic field in
the space around it. The magnetic field that surrounds an ordinary bar magnet (Figure 7-13a) is created by the motions of negatively charged electrons within the iron atoms of which the
magnet is made. The Earth’s magnetic field is similar to that of a
bar magnet, as Figure 7-13b shows. The consensus among geolo-

The Magnetic Fields of a Bar Magnet and of the Earth (a) This
picture was made by placing a piece of paper on top of a bar magnet,
then spreading iron filings on the paper. The pattern of the filings show
the magnetic field lines, which appear to stream from one of the
magnet’s poles to the other. (b) The Earth’s magnetic field lines have a
similar pattern. Although the Earth’s field is produced in a different way—
by electric currents in the liquid portion of our planet’s interior—the field

gists is that this magnetic field is caused by the motion of the liquid portions of the Earth’s interior. Because this molten material
(mostly iron) conducts electricity, these motions give rise to electric currents, which in turn produce the Earth’s magnetic field.
Our planet’s rotation helps to sustain these motions and hence the
magnetic field. This process for producing a magnetic field is
called a dynamo.

CAUTION! While the Earth’s magnetic field is similar to that of
a giant bar magnet, you should not take this picture too literally.
The Earth is not simply a magnetized ball of iron. In an iron bar
magnet, the electrons of different atoms orbit their nuclei in the
same general direction, so that the magnetic fields generated by
individual atoms add together to form a single, strong field. But
at temperatures above 770°C (1418°F ⫽ 1043 K), the orientations of the electron orbits become randomized. The fields of individual atoms tend to cancel each other out, and the iron loses
its magnetism. Geological evidence shows that almost all of the
Earth’s interior is hotter than 770°C, so the iron there cannot
be extensively magnetized. The correct picture is that the Earth
acts as a dynamo: The liquid iron carries electric currents, and
these currents create the Earth’s magnetic field.

is much the same as if there were a giant bar magnet inside the Earth.
This “bar magnet” is not exactly aligned with the Earth’s rotation axis,
which is why the magnetic north and south poles are not at the same
locations as the true, or geographic, poles. A compass needle points
toward the north magnetic pole, not the true north pole. (a: Jules
Bucher/Photo Researchers)

If a planet or satellite has a mostly solid interior, then the dynamo mechanism cannot work: Material in the interior cannot
flow, there are no electric currents, and the planet or satellite does
not generate a magnetic field. One example of this is the Moon.
As we saw in Section 7-6, the extensive cratering of the lunar surface indicates that the Moon has no geologic activity and must
therefore have a mostly solid interior. Measurements made during the Apollo missions, in which 12 humans visited the lunar
surface between 1969 and 1972, showed that the present-day
Moon indeed has no global magnetic field. However, careful
magnetic measurements of lunar rocks returned by the Apollo astronauts indicate that the Moon did have a weak magnetic field
when the rocks solidified. These rocks, like the rest of the lunar
surface, are very old. Hence, in the distant past the Moon may
have had a small amount of molten iron in its interior that acted
as a dynamo. This material presumably solidified at least partially
as the Moon cooled, so that the lunar magnetic field disappeared.
We have now identified another general rule about planets
and satellites:
A planet or satellite with a global magnetic field has liquid
material in its interior that conducts electricity and is in
motion, generating the magnetic field.

came magnetized by the planetwide field, and this material has retained its magnetization over the eons. Mars Global Surveyor has
not found magnetized areas in the younger terrain of the lowlands. Hence, the planetwide Martian magnetic field must have
shut off by the time the lowland terrain formed.
The most intense planetary magnetic field in the solar system
is that of Jupiter: at the tops of Jupiter’s clouds, the magnetic field
is about 14 times stronger than the field at the Earth’s surface. It
is thought that Jupiter’s field, like the Earth’s, is produced by a
dynamo acting deep within the planet’s interior. Unlike the Earth,
however, Jupiter is composed primarily of hydrogen and helium,
not substances like iron that conduct electricity. How, then, can
Jupiter have a dynamo that generates such strong magnetic fields?

To answer this question, recall from Section 5-8 that a
hydrogen atom consists of a single proton orbited by a
single electron. Deep inside Jupiter, the pressure is so
great and hydrogen atoms are squeezed so close together that
electrons can hop from one atom to another. This hopping motion creates an electric current, just as the ordered movement of
electrons in the copper wires of a flashlight constitutes an electric
current. In other words, the highly compressed hydrogen deep inside Jupiter behaves like an electrically conducting metal; thus, it
is called liquid metallic hydrogen.
Laboratory experiments show that hydrogen becomes a liquid metal when the pressure is more than about 1.4 million times
ordinary atmospheric pressure on Earth. Recent calculations suggest that this transition occurs about 7000 km below Jupiter’s
cloudtops. Most of the planet’s enormous bulk lies below this
level, so there is a tremendous amount of liquid metallic hydrogen within Jupiter. Since Jupiter rotates rapidly—a “day” on
Jupiter is just less than 10 hours long—this liquid metal moves
rapidly, generating the planet’s powerful magnetic field. Saturn

Thus, by studying the magnetic field of a planet or satellite,
we can learn about that world’s interior. This explains why many
spacecraft carry devices called magnetometers to measure magnetic fields. Magnetometers are often placed on a long boom extending outward from the body of the spacecraft (Figure 7-14).
This isolates them from the magnetic fields produced by electric
currents in the spacecraft’s own circuitry.
Measurements made with magnetometers on spacecraft have
led to a number of striking discoveries. For example, it has been
found that Mercury has a planetwide magnetic field like the
Earth’s, although it is only about 1% as strong as the Earth’s
field. Mercury has a heavily cratered surface and hence little or
no geologic activity, which by itself would suggest that the planet’s
interior is mostly solid. The magnetic field measurements show
that some of Mercury’s interior must be in the liquid state to act
as a dynamo. By contrast, Venus has no measurable planetwide
magnetic field, even though the paucity of craters on its surface
indicates the presence of geologic activity and hence a hot interior of the planet. One possible reason for the lack of a magnetic
field on Venus is that the planet turns on its axis very slowly, taking 243 days for a complete rotation. Because of this slow rotation, the fluid material within the planet is hardly agitated at all,
and so may not move in the fashion that generates a magnetic
field.
Like Venus, Mars has no planetwide magnetic field. But the
magnetometer aboard the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft, which
went into orbit around Mars in 1997, found magnetized regions
in the cratered highlands of the Martian southern hemisphere
(Figure 7-15). As we saw in Section 7-6, these portions of the
Martian surface are very old, and so would have formed when
the planet’s interior was still hot and molten. Electric currents in
the flowing molten material could then produce a planetwide
magnetic field. As surface material cooled and solidified, it be-

also has a magnetic field produced by dynamo action in liquid
metallic hydrogen. (The field is weaker than Jupiter’s because
Saturn is a smaller planet with less internal pressure, so there is
less of the liquid metal available.)
Uranus and Neptune also have magnetic fields, but they cannot be produced in the same way: Because these planets are relatively small, the internal pressure is not great enough to turn
liquid hydrogen into a metal. Instead, it is thought that both
Uranus and Neptune have large amounts of liquid water in their
interiors and that this water has molecules of ammonia and other
substances dissolved in it. (The fluid used for washing windows
has a similar chemical composition.) Under the pressures found
in this interior water, the dissolved molecules lose one or more
electrons and become electrically charged (that is, they become
ionized; see Section 5-8). Water is a good conductor of electricity
when it has such electrically charged molecules dissolved in it,
and electric currents in this fluid are probably the source of the
magnetic fields of Uranus and Neptune.

7-8 The diversity of the solar system is a
result of its origin and evolution
Our brief tour of the solar system has revealed its almost dizzying variety. No two planets are alike, satellites come in all sizes,
the extent of cratering varies from one terrestrial planet to another, and the magnetic fields of different planets vary dramatically in their strength and in how they are produced. (The Cosmic

Connections figure that closes this
The similarities and
chapter summarizes these properties
of the planets.) All of this variety differences among the
leads us to a simple yet profound planets can be logically
question: Why are the planets and explained by a model of
satellites of the solar system so dif- the solar system’s origin
ferent from each other?
and evolution
Among humans, the differences
from one individual to another result from heredity (the genetic
traits passed on from an individual’s parents) and environment
(the circumstances under which the individual matures to an adult).
As we will find in the fzollowing chapter, much the same is true
for the worlds of the solar system.
In Chapter 8 we will see evidence that the entire solar system
shares a common “heredity,” in that the planets, satellites, comets,
asteroids, and the Sun itself formed from the same cloud of interstellar gas and dust. The composition of this cloud was shaped by
cosmic processes, including nuclear reactions that took place
within stars that died long before our solar system was formed.
We will see how different planets formed in different environments depending on their distance from the Sun and will discover
how these environmental variations gave rise to the planets and
satellites of our present-day solar system. And we will see how we
can test these ideas of solar system origin and evolution by studying planetary systems orbiting other stars.
Our journey through the solar system is just beginning. In
this chapter we have explored space to examine the variety of the
present-day solar system; in Chapter 8 we will journey through
time to see how our solar system came to be.

Key Ideas
Properties of the Planets: All of the planets orbit the Sun in the
same direction and in almost the same plane. Most of the planets
have nearly circular orbits.
• The four inner planets are called terrestrial planets. They are
relatively small (with diameters of 5000 to 13,000 km), have high
average densities (4000 to 5500 kg/m3), and are composed primarily of rocky materials.
• The four giant outer planets are called Jovian planets. They
have large diameters (50,000 to 143,000 km) and low average
densities (700 to 1700 kg/m3) and are composed primarily of light
elements such as hydrogen and helium.
Satellites and Small Bodies in the Solar System: Besides the planets, the solar system includes satellites of the planets, asteroids,
comets, and trans-Neptunian objects.
• Seven large planetary satellites (one of which is the Moon) are
comparable in size to the planet Mercury. The remaining satellites of the solar system are much smaller.
• Asteroids are small, rocky objects, while comets and transNeptunian objects are made of ice and rock. All are remnants left
over from the formation of the planets.
• Most asteroids are found in the asteroid belt between the orbits
of Mars and Jupiter, and most trans-Neptunian objects lie in the
Kuiper belt outside the orbit of Neptune. Pluto is one of the
largest members of the Kuiper belt.
Spectroscopy and the Composition of the Planets: Spectroscopy,
the study of spectra, provides information about the chemical
composition of objects in the solar system.
• The spectrum of a planet or satellite with an atmosphere reveals
the atmosphere’s composition. If there is no atmosphere, the spectrum indicates the composition of the surface.
• The substances that make up the planets can be classified as
gases, ices, or rock, depending on the temperatures at which they
solidify.

Impact Craters: When an asteroid, comet, or meteoroid collides
with the surface of a terrestrial planet or satellite, the result is an
impact crater.
• Geologic activity renews the surface and erases craters, so a terrestrial world with extensive cratering has an old surface and little or no geologic activity.
• Because geologic activity is powered by internal heat, and smaller
worlds lose heat more rapidly, as a general rule smaller terrestrial
worlds are more extensively cratered.
Magnetic Fields and Planetary Interiors: Planetary magnetic fields
are produced by the motion of electrically conducting liquids inside the planet. This mechanism is called a dynamo. If a planet
has no magnetic field, that is evidence that there is little such liquid material in the planet’s interior or that the liquid is not in a
state of motion.
• The magnetic fields of terrestrial planets are produced by metals such as iron in the liquid state. The stronger fields of the Jovian planets are generated by liquid metallic hydrogen or by water
with ionized molecules dissolved in it.

hat did our solar system look like before the planets were
fully formed? The answer may lie in these remarkable images from the Hubble Space Telescope. Each image shows
an immense disk of gas and dust centered on a young star. (In
each image the light from the star itself was blocked out within
the telescope to make the rather faint disk more visible.) Astronomers strongly suspect that in its infancy our own Sun was
surrounded by a disk of this kind and that the planets coalesced
from it.
In this chapter we will examine the evidence that led astronomers to this picture of the origin of the planets. We will see
how the abundances of different chemical elements in the solar
system indicate that the Sun and planets formed from a thin cloud
of interstellar matter some 4.56 billion years ago, an age determined by measuring the radioactivity of meteorites. We will learn
how the nature of planetary orbits gives important clues to what
happened as this cloud contracted and how evidence from mete-

orites reveals the chaotic conditions that existed within the cloud.
And we will see how this cloud eventually evolved into the solar
system that we see today.
In the past few years astronomers have been able to test this
picture of planetary formation by examining disks around young
stars (like the ones in the accompanying images). Most remarkably of all, they have discovered planets in orbit around dozens
of other stars. These recent observations provide valuable information about how our own system of planets came to be.

Any theory of the origin of the solar system must be able to account for these properties of the planets.
Property 1: Sizes and compositions of
The terrestrial planets, which are composed primarily of rocky substances, are relatively small,
terrestrial planets versus Jovian planets
while the Jovian planets, which are composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, are
relatively large (see Sections 7-1 and 7-4).
Property 2: Directions and orientations

All of the planets orbit the Sun in the same direction, and all of their orbits are in nearly the
same plane (see Section 7-1).

Property 3: Sizes of terrestrial planet
orbits versus Jovian planet orbits

The terrestrial planets orbit close to the Sun, while the Jovian planets orbit far from the Sun
(see Section 7-1).

our current understanding of how the solar system came to be—
that is, our current best theory of the origin of the solar system.
Recall from Section 1-1 that a theory is not merely a set of
wild speculations, but a self-consistent collection of ideas that
must pass the test of providing an accurate description of the real
world. Since no humans were present to witness the formation of
the planets, scientists must base their theories of solar system origins on their observations of the present-day solar system. (In an
analogous way, paleontologists base their understanding of the
lives of dinosaurs on the evidence provided by fossils that have
survived to the present day.) In so doing, they are following the
steps of the scientific method that we described in Section 1-1.
What key attributes of the solar system should guide us in
building a theory of solar system origins? Among the many properties of the planets that we discussed in Chapter 7, three of the
most important are listed in Table 8-1.
Any theory that attempts to describe the origin of the solar
system must be able to explain how these attributes came to be.
We begin by considering what Property 1 tells us; we will return
to Properties 2 and 3 and the orbits of the planets later in this
chapter.

8-2 The cosmic abundances of the chemical
elements are the result of how stars evolve
The small sizes of the terrestrial planets compared to the Jovian
planets (Property 1 in Table 8-1) suggest that some chemical elements are quite common in our solar system, while others are
quite rare. The tremendous masses of the Jovian planets—Jupiter
alone has more mass than all of the other planets combined—
means that the elements of which
they are made, primarily hydrogen The terrestrial planets
and helium, are very abundant. The
are small because they
Sun, too, is made almost entirely of
hydrogen and helium: Its average are made of less
density of 1410 kg/m3 is in the same abundant elements
range as the densities of the Jovian
planets (see Table 7-1), and its absorption spectrum (see Figure
5-12) shows the dominance of hydrogen and helium in the Sun’s
atmosphere. Hydrogen, the most abundant element, makes up nearly
three-quarters of the combined mass of the Sun and planets. Helium is the second most abundant element. Together, hydrogen
and helium account for about 98% of the mass of all the material

in the solar system. All of the other chemical elements are relatively
rare; combined, they make up the remaining 2% (Figure 8-1).
The dominance of hydrogen and helium is not merely a characteristic of our local part of the universe. By analyzing the spectra of stars and galaxies, astronomers have found essentially the
same pattern of chemical abundances out to the farthest distance
attainable by the most powerful telescopes. Hence, the vast majority of the atoms in the universe are hydrogen and helium atoms.
The elements that make up the bulk of the Earth—mostly iron,
oxygen, and silicon—are relatively rare in the universe as a whole,
as are the elements of which living organisms are made—carbon,
oxygen, nitrogen, and phosphorus, among others. (You may find

A Mature Star Ejecting Gas and Dust The star Antares is
shedding material from its outer layers, forming a thin cloud
around the star. We can see the cloud because some of the ejected
material has condensed into tiny grains of dust that reflect the star’s
light. (Dust particles in the air around you reflect light in the same way,
which is why you can see them within a shaft of sunlight in a darkened
room). Antares lies some 600 light-years from Earth in the constellation

at the very end of their lives, in a spectacular detonation called a
supernova, which blows the star apart (see Figure 1-6).
No matter how it escapes, the ejected material contains heavy
elements dredged up from the star’s interior, where they were
formed. This material becomes part of the interstellar medium, a
tenuous collection of gas and dust that pervades the spaces between the stars. As different stars die, they increasingly enrich the
interstellar medium with heavy elements. Observations show that
new stars form as condensations in the interstellar medium (Figure 8-3). Thus, these new stars have an adequate supply of heavy
elements from which to develop a system of planets, satellites,
comets, and asteroids. Our own solar system must have formed
from enriched material in just this way. Thus, our solar system
contains “recycled” material that was produced long ago inside a
now-dead star. This “recycled” material includes all of the carbon in your body, all of the oxygen that you breathe, and all of
the iron and silicon in the soil beneath your feet.

The Abundances of the Elements
Stars create different heavy elements in different amounts. For example, oxygen (as well as carbon, silicon, and iron) is readily produced in the interiors of massive stars, whereas gold (as well as
silver, platinum, and uranium) is created only under special

There is a good reason for this overwhelming abundance of hydrogen and helium. A wealth of evidence
has led astronomers to conclude that the universe began some 13.7 billion years ago with a violent event called the
Big Bang (see Section 1-4). Only the lightest elements—hydrogen
and helium, as well as tiny amounts of lithium and perhaps
beryllium—emerged from the enormously high temperatures following this cosmic event. All the heavier elements were manufactured by stars later, either by thermonuclear fusion reactions deep
in their interiors or by the violent explosions that mark the end
of massive stars. Were it not for these processes that take place
only in stars, there would be no heavy elements in the universe,
no planet like our Earth, and no humans to contemplate the nature of the cosmos.
Because our solar system contains heavy elements, it must be
that at least some of its material was once inside other stars. But
how did this material become available to help build our solar system? The answer is that near the ends of their lives, stars cast much
of their matter back out into space. For most stars this process is
a comparatively gentle one, in which a star’s outer layers are gradually expelled. Figure 8-2 shows a star losing material in this fashion. This ejected material appears as the cloudy region, or nebulosity
(from nubes, Latin for “cloud”), that surrounds the star and is illuminated by it. A few stars eject matter much more dramatically

New Stars Forming from Gas and Dust Unlike Figure 8-2,

this image shows young stars in the constellation Orion (the Hunter) that
have only recently formed from a cloud of gas and dust. The bluish, wispy
appearance of the cloud (called NGC 1973-1975-1977) is caused by
starlight reflecting off interstellar dust grains within the cloud (see Box
5-4). The grains are made of heavy elements produced by earlier
generations of stars. (David Malin/Anglo-Australian Observatory)

Abundances of the Lighter Elements This graph shows the

order of increasing atomic number) compared to a value of 1012 for
hydrogen. The inset lists the 10 most abundant of these elements, which

circumstances. Consequently, gold is rare in our solar system and
in the universe as a whole, while oxygen is relatively abundant
(although still much less abundant than hydrogen or helium).
A convenient way to express the relative abundances of the
various elements is to say how many atoms of a particular element are found for every trillion (1012) hydrogen atoms. For example, for every 1012 hydrogen atoms in space, there are about
100 billion (1011) helium atoms. From spectral analysis of stars
and chemical analysis of Earth rocks, Moon rocks, and bits of interplanetary debris called meteorites, scientists have determined
the relative abundances of the elements in our part of the Milky
Way Galaxy today. Figure 8-4 shows the relative abundances of
the 30 lightest elements, arranged in order of their atomic numbers. An element’s atomic number is the number of protons in the
nucleus of an atom of that element. It is also equal to the number of electrons orbiting the nucleus (see Box 5-5). In general, the
greater the atomic number of an atom, the greater its mass.

CAUTION! Figure 8-1 shows that our solar system has 2.6
times (71% versus 27%) as much hydrogen than helium by
mass, while Figure 8-4 shows that there is about 10 times as
much hydrogen than helium by number of atoms. The explanation of this seeming inconsistency is that a helium atom has
about 4 times the mass of a hydrogen atom, which makes helium more important on a per-mass basis than on a per-number
basis.
The inset in Figure 8-4 lists the 10 most abundant elements.

dant element, is quite rare relative to hydrogen (H) and helium
(He): There are only 8.5 ⫻ 108 oxygen atoms for each 1012 hydrogen atoms and each 1011 helium atoms. Expressed another
way, for each oxygen atom in our region of the Milky Way
Galaxy, there are about 1200 hydrogen atoms and 120 helium
atoms.
In addition to the 10 most abundant elements listed in Figure 8-3, five elements are moderately abundant: sodium (Na), aluminum (Al), argon (Ar), calcium (Ca), and nickel (Ni). These
elements have abundances in the range of 106 to 107 relative to
the standard 1012 hydrogen atoms. Most of the other elements
are much rarer. For example, for every 1012 hydrogen atoms in
the solar system, there are only six atoms of gold.
The small cosmic abundances of elements other than hydrogen and helium help to explain why the terrestrial planets are so
small (Property 1 in Table 8-1). Because the heavier elements required to make a terrestrial planet are rare, only relatively small
planets can form out of them. By contrast, hydrogen and helium
are so abundant that it was possible for these elements to form
large Jovian planets.

8-3 The abundances of radioactive elements
reveal the solar system’s age
The heavy elements can tell us even more about the solar system:
They also help us determine its age. The particular heavy elements
that provide us with this information are radioactive. Their atomic
nuclei are unstable because they contain too many protons or too

many neutrons. A radioactive nuOur solar system, which

it becomes stable. In doing so, a nu- formed 9 billion years
cleus may change from one element after the Big Bang, is a
to another. Physicists refer to this relative newcomer in the
transmutation as radioactive decay. universe
For example, a radioactive form of
the element rubidium (atomic number 37) decays into the element
strontium (atomic number 38) when one of the neutrons in the
rubidium nucleus decays into a proton and an electron (which is
ejected from the nucleus).
Experiment shows that each type of radioactive nucleus decays at its own characteristic rate, which can be measured in the
laboratory. This observation is the key to a technique called radioactive dating, which is used to determine the ages of rocks.
If a rock contained a certain amount of radioactive rubidium
when it first formed, over time more and more of the atoms of
rubidium within the rock will decay into strontium atoms. The
ratio of the number of strontium atoms the rock contains to the
number of rubidium atoms it contains then gives a measure of
the age of the rock. Box 8-1 describes radioactive dating in more
detail.

Dating the Solar System
Scientists have applied techniques of radioactive dating to rocks
taken from all over the Earth. The results show that most rocks are
tens or hundreds of millions of years old, but that some rocks
are as much as 4 billion (4 ⫻ 109) years old. These results confirm that geologic processes have produced new surface material
over the Earth’s history, as we concluded from the small number
of impact craters found on Earth (see Section 7-6). They also
show that the Earth is at least 4 ⫻ 109 years old.
Radioactive dating has also been applied to rock samples
brought back from the Moon by the Apollo astronauts. The oldest Apollo specimen, collected from one of the most heavily
cratered and hence most ancient regions of the Moon, is 4.5 ⫻
109 years old. But the oldest rocks found anywhere in the solar
system are meteorites, bits of interplanetary debris that survive
passing through the Earth’s atmosphere and land on our planet’s
surface (Figure 8-5). Radioactive dating of meteorites reveals that
they are all nearly the same age, about 4.56 billion years old. The
absence of any younger or older meteorites indicates that these
are all remnants of objects that formed at the same time in the
early solar system. We conclude that the age of the oldest meteorites, about 4.56 ⫻ 109 years, is the age of the solar system itself. Note that this almost inconceivably long span of time is only
about one-third of the current age of the universe, 13.7 ⫻ 109
years.
Thus, by studying the abundances of radioactive elements,
we are led to a remarkable insight: Some 4.56 billion years ago,
a collection of hydrogen, helium, and heavy elements came together to form the Sun and all of the objects that orbit around it.
All of those heavy elements, including the carbon atoms in your
body and the oxygen atoms that you breathe, were created and
cast off by stars that lived and died long before our solar system
formed, during the first 9 billion years of the universe’s existence.
We are literally made of star dust.

8-4 The Sun and planets formed
from a solar nebula
We have seen how processes in the Big Bang and within ancient
stars produced the raw ingredients
of our solar system. But given these Astronomers see young
ingredients, how did they combine
stars that may be
to make the Sun and planets? Astronomers have developed a variety forming planets today in
of models for the origin of the solar the same way that our
system. The test of these models is solar system did billions
whether they explain the properties of years ago
of the present-day system of Sun and
planets.

The Failed Tidal Hypothesis
Any model of the origin of the solar system must explain why all
the planets orbit the Sun in the same direction and in nearly the
same plane (Property 2 in Table 8-1). One model that was devised
explicitly to address this issue was the tidal hypothesis, proposed
in the early 1900s. As we saw in Section 4-8, two nearby planets,
stars, or galaxies exert tidal forces on each other that cause the
objects to elongate. In the tidal hypothesis, another star happened
to pass close by the Sun, and the star’s tidal forces drew a long
filament out of the Sun. The filament material would then go into
orbit around the Sun, and all of it would naturally orbit in the
same direction and in the same plane. From this filament the planets would condense. However, it was shown in the 1930s that
tidal forces strong enough to pull a filament out of the Sun would
cause the filament to disperse before it could condense into planets. Hence, the tidal hypothesis cannot be correct.

Radioactive Dating
ow old are the rocks found on the Earth and other planets? Are rocks found at different locations the same age or
of different ages? How old are meteorites? Questions like these
are important to scientists who wish to reconstruct the history
of our solar system. But simply looking at a rock cannot tell
us whether it was formed a thousand years, a million years, or
a billion years ago. Fortunately, most rocks contain trace
amounts of radioactive elements such as uranium. By measuring the relative abundances of various radioactive isotopes and
their decay products within a rock, scientists can determine the
rock’s age.
As we saw in Box 5-5, every atom of a particular element
has the same number of protons in its nucleus. However, different isotopes of the same element have different numbers of
neutrons in their nuclei. For example, the common isotopes
of uranium are 235U and 238U. Each isotope of uranium has
92 protons in its nucleus (correspondingly, uranium is element 92 in the periodic table; see Box 5-5). However, a 235U
nucleus contains 143 neutrons, whereas a 238U nucleus has
146 neutrons.
A radioactive nucleus with too many protons or too many
neutrons is unstable; to become stable, it decays by ejecting
particles until it becomes stable. If the number of protons (the
atomic number) changes in this process, the nucleus changes
from one element to another.
Some radioactive isotopes decay rapidly, while others decay slowly. Physicists find it convenient to talk about the decay rate in terms of an isotope’s half-life. The half-life of an
isotope is the time interval in which one-half of the nuclei decay. For example, the half-life of 238U is 4.5 billion (4.5 ⫻ 109)
years. This means that if you start out with 1 kg of 238U, after 4.5 billion years you will have only 1⁄2 kg of 238U remain-

H

ing; the other 1⁄2 kg will have turned into other elements. If you
want another half-life, so that a total of 9.0 billion years has
elapsed, only 1⁄4 kg of 238U—one-half of one-half of the original amount—will remain. Several isotopes useful for determining the ages of rocks are listed in the accompanying table.
To see how geologists date rocks, consider the slow conversion of radioactive rubidium (87Rb) into strontium (87Sr).
(The periodic table in Box 5-5 shows that the atomic numbers
for these elements are 37 for rubidium and 38 for strontium,
so in the decay a neutron is transformed into a proton. In this
process an electron is ejected from the nucleus.) Over the years,
the amount of 87Rb in a rock decreases, while the amount of
87Sr increases. Because the 87Sr appears in the rock due to radioactive decay, this isotope is called radiogenic. Dating the
rock is not simply a matter of measuring its ratio of rubidium
to strontium, however, because the rock already had some
strontium in it when it was formed. Geologists must therefore
determine how much fresh strontium came from the decay of
rubidium after the rock’s formation.
To do this, geologists use as a reference another isotope of
strontium whose concentration has remained constant. In this
case, they use 86Sr, which is stable and is not created by radioactive decay; it is said to be nonradiogenic. Dating a rock
thus entails comparing the ratio of radiogenic and nonradiogenic strontium (87Sr/86Sr) in the rock to the ratio of radioactive rubidium to nonradiogenic strontium (87Rb/86Sr). Because
the half-life for converting 87Rb into 87Sr is known, the rock’s
age can then be calculated from these ratios (see the table).
Radioactive isotopes decay with the same half-life no matter where in the universe they are found. Hence, scientists have
used the same techniques to determine the ages of rocks from
the Moon and of meteorites.

The Successful Nebular Hypothesis
An entirely different model is now thought to describe the most
likely series of events that led to our present solar system (Figure
8-6). The central idea of this model dates to the late 1700s, when
the German philosopher Immanuel Kant and the French scientist
Pierre-Simon de Laplace turned their attention to the manner in
which the planets orbit the Sun. Both concluded that the arrangement of the orbits—all in the same direction and in nearly the
same plane—could not be mere coincidence. To explain the or-

bits, Kant and Laplace independently proposed that our entire solar system, including the Sun as well as all of its planets and satellites, formed from a vast, rotating cloud of gas and dust called
the solar nebula (Figure 8-6a). This model is called the nebular
hypothesis.
The consensus among today’s astronomers is that Kant and
Laplace were exactly right. In the modern version of the nebular
hypothesis, at the outset the solar nebula was similar in character to the nebulosity shown in Figure 8-3 and had a mass somewhat greater than that of our present-day Sun.

Comparative Planetology II: The Origin of Our Solar System

(a) A diffuse, roughly spherical, slowly
rotating nebula begins to contract.

(b) As a result of contraction and rotation, a flat, rapidly
rotating disk forms. The matter concentrated at the
center becomes the protosun.

Figure 8-6
The Birth of the Solar System (a) A cloud of interstellar gas and dust
begins to contract because of its own gravity. (b) As the cloud flattens
and spins more rapidly around its rotation axis, a central condensation
develops that evolves into a glowing protosun. The planets will form out
of the surrounding disk of gas and dust.

191

As the newly created protosun continued to contract and
become denser, its temperature continued to climb as well. After about 105 (100,000) years, the protosun’s surface temperature stabilized at about 6000 K, but the temperature in its
interior kept increasing to ever higher values as the central regions of the protosun became denser and denser. Eventually, after perhaps 107 (10 million) years had passed since the solar
nebula first began to contract, the gas at the center of the protosun reached a density of about 105 kg/m3 (a hundred times
denser than water) and a temperature of a few million kelvins
(that is, a few times 106 K). Under these extreme conditions, nuclear reactions that convert hydrogen into helium began in the
protosun’s interior. When this happened, the energy released by
these reactions stopped the contraction and a true star was born.
Nuclear reactions continue to the present day in the interior of
the Sun and are the source of all the energy that the Sun radiates into space.

The Protoplanetary Disk
If the solar nebula had not been rotating at all, everything would
have fallen directly into the protosun, leaving nothing behind to
form the planets. Instead, the solar nebula must have had an overall slight rotation, which caused its evolution to follow a different path. As the slowly rotating nebula collapsed inward, it would
naturally have tended to rotate faster. This relationship between
the size of an object and its rotation speed is an example of a general principle called the conservation of angular momentum.

ANALOGY Figure skaters make use of the conservation of angular momentum. When a spinning skater pulls her arms and
legs in close to her body, the rate at which she spins automatically increases (Figure 8-7). Even if you are not a figure skater,

Each part of the nebula exerted a gravitational attraction on
the other parts, and these mutual gravitational pulls tended to
make the nebula contract. As it contracted, the greatest concentration of matter occurred at the center of the nebula, forming a
relatively dense region called the protosun. As its name suggests,
this part of the solar nebula eventually developed into the Sun.
The planets formed from the much sparser material in the outer
regions of the solar nebula. Indeed, the mass of all the planets together is only 0.1% of the Sun’s mass.

Evolution of the Protosun
When you drop a ball, the gravitational attraction of the Earth
makes the ball fall faster and faster as it falls; in the same way,
material falling inward toward the protosun would have gained
speed. As this fast-moving material ran into the protosun, the energy of the collision was converted into thermal energy, causing
the temperature deep inside the solar nebula to climb. This process,
in which the gravitational energy of a contracting gas cloud is
converted into thermal energy, is called Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction, after the nineteenth-century physicists who first described it.

that formed only recently. These, too, are called protoplanetary
disks, because it is thought that planets can eventually form from
these disks around other stars. Hence, these disks are planetary
systems that are still “under construction.” By studying these
disks around other stars, astronomers are able to examine what
our solar nebula may have been like some 4.56 ⫻ 109 years ago.

Figure 8-8 shows a number of protoplanetary disks in
the Orion Nebula, a region of active star formation. A
star is visible at the center of each disk, which reinforces the idea that our Sun began to shine before the planets
were fully formed. (The images that open this chapter show even
more detailed views of disks surrounding young stars.) A study of
110 young stars in the Orion Nebula detected protoplanetary
disks around 56 of them, which suggests that systems of planets
may form around a substantial fraction of stars. Later in this
chapter we will see direct evidence for planets that have formed
around stars other than the Sun.

As the solar nebula began to rotate more rapidly, it also
tended to flatten out (Figure 8-6b). From the perspective of a particle rotating along with the nebula, it felt as though there were
a force pushing the particle away from the nebula’s axis of rotation. (Likewise, passengers on a spinning carnival ride seem to
feel a force pushing them outward and away from the ride’s axis
of rotation.) This apparent force was directed opposite to the inward pull of gravity, and so it tended to slow the contraction of
material toward the nebula’s rotation axis. But there was no such
effect opposing contraction in a direction parallel to the rotation
axis. Some 105 (100,000) years after the solar nebula first began
to contract, it had developed the structure shown in Figure 8-5b,
with a rotating, flattened disk surrounding what will become the
protosun. This disk is called the protoplanetary disk or proplyd,
since planets formed from its material. This model explains why
their orbits all lie in essentially the same plane and why they all
orbit the Sun in the same direction.
There were no humans to observe these processes taking
place during the formation of the solar system. But Earth astronomers have seen disks of material surrounding other stars

the nebula. A young, recently formed star is at the center of each
disk. (The disk at upper right is seen nearly edge-on.) The inset at the
lower left shows the size of our own solar system for comparison.

able to survive in the cooler, outer portions of the solar nebula.

To understand how the planets, asteroids, and comets formed, we
must look at the conditions that prevailed within the solar nebula. The density of material in the part of the nebula outside the
protosun was rather low, as was the pressure of the nebula’s gas.
If the pressure is sufficiently low, a substance cannot remain in
the liquid state, but must end up as either a solid or a gas. For a
given pressure, what determines whether a certain substance is a
solid or a gas is its condensation temperature. If the temperature
of a substance is above its condensation temperature, the substance is a gas; if the temperature is below the condensation temperature, the substance solidifies into tiny specks of dust or
snowflakes. You can often see similar behavior on a cold morning. The air temperature can be above the condensation temperature of water, while the cold windows of parked cars may have
temperatures below the condensation temperature. Thus, water
molecules in the air remain as a gas (water vapor) but form solid
ice particles (frost) on the car windows.
Substances such as water (H2O), methane (CH4), and ammonia (NH3) have low condensation temperatures, ranging from
100 to 300 K. Rock-forming substances have much higher condensation temperatures, in the range from 1300 to 1600 K. The
gas cloud from which the solar system formed had an initial temperature near 50 K, so all of these substances could have existed
in solid form. Thus, the solar nebula would have been populated
by an abundance of small ice particles and solid dust grains like
the one shown in Figure 8-9. (Recall from Section 7-4 that “ice”
can refer to frozen CO2, CH4, or NH3, as well as frozen water.)
But hydrogen and helium, the most abundant elements in the solar nebula, have condensation temperatures so near absolute zero
that these substances always existed as gases during the creation
of the solar system. You can best visualize the initial state of the
solar nebula as a thin gas of hydrogen and helium strewn with
tiny dust particles.
This state of affairs changed as the central part of the solar
nebula underwent Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction to form the protosun. During this phase, the protosun was actually quite a bit
more luminous than the present-day Sun, and it heated the innermost part of the solar nebula to temperatures above 2000 K.
Meanwhile, temperatures in the outermost regions of the solar
nebula remained below 50 K.
Figure 8-10 shows the probable temperature distribution in
the solar nebula at this stage in the formation of our solar system. In the inner regions of the solar nebula, water, methane, and
ammonia were vaporized by the high temperatures. Only materials with high condensation temperatures could have remained
solid. Of these materials, iron, silicon, magnesium, and sulfur
were particularly abundant, followed closely by aluminum, calcium, and nickel. (Most of these elements were present in the
form of oxides, which are chemical compounds containing oxy-

Temperature Distribution in the Solar Nebula This graph shows how
temperatures probably varied across the solar nebula as the planets were
forming. Note the general decline in temperature with increasing distance
from the center of the nebula. Beyond 5 AU from the center of the nebula,
temperatures were low enough for water to condense and form ice;
beyond 30 AU, methane (CH4) could also condense into ice.

Chapter 8

The Evidence of Chondrules
Important clues about the evolution of the inner solar system
come from studies of meteorites, which, as we saw in Section 8-3,
are the oldest solid objects known in the solar system. Many of
these are fragments of planetesimals that were never incorporated
into the planets. Most meteorites contain not only dust grains but
also chondrules, which are small, glassy, roughly spherical blobs
(Figure 8-11). (The “ch” in “chondrule” is pronounced as in
“chord.”) Liquids tend to form spherical drops (like drops of water), so the shape of chondrules shows that they were once molten.
Attempts to produce chondrules in the laboratory show that
the blobs must have melted suddenly, then solidified over the
space of only an hour or so. This means they could not have been
melted by the temperature of the inner solar nebula, which would
have remained high for hundreds of thousands of years after the

collided and merged into small chunks. Initially, electric forces—
that is, chemical bonds—held these chunks together, in the same
way that chemical bonds hold an ordinary rock together. Over a
few million years, these chunks coalesced into roughly 109 asteroidlike objects called planetesimals, with diameters of a kilometer or so. These were large enough to be held together by the
gravitational attraction of the different parts of the planetesimal
for each other. During the next stage, gravitational attraction between the planetesimals caused them to collide and accumulate
into still-larger objects called protoplanets, which were roughly
the size and mass of our Moon. This accumulation of material to
form larger and larger objects is called accretion. During the final
stage, these Moon-sized protoplanets collided to form the inner
planets. This final episode must have involved some truly spectacular, world-shattering collisions.
In the inner solar nebula only materials with high condensation temperatures could form dust grains and hence protoplanets,
so the result was a set of planets made predominantly of materials such as iron, silicon, magnesium, and nickel, and their oxides.
This is just the composition of the present-day terrestrial planets.
At first the material that coalesced to form protoplanets in
the inner solar nebula remained largely in solid form, despite the
high temperatures close to the protosun. But as the protoplanets
grew, they were heated by the violent impacts of planetesimals as
well as the decay of radioactive elements such as uranium, and
this heat caused melting. Thus, the terrestrial planets began their
existence as spheres of at least partially molten rocky materials.
Material was free to move within these molten spheres, so the
denser, iron-rich minerals sank to the centers of the planets while
the less dense silicon-rich minerals floated to their surfaces. This
process is called chemical differentiation (see Box 7-1). In this
way the terrestrial planets developed their dense iron cores. We
saw in Section 7-7 that this electrically conductive iron gives rise
to the magnetic fields of the terrestrial planets.
Because the materials that went into the terrestrial planets are
relatively scarce, these planets ended up having relatively small
mass and hence relatively weak gravity. As a result, these terrestrial protoplanets were unable to capture any of the hydrogen or
helium in the solar nebula to form atmospheres (see Box 7-2). The
thin envelopes of atmosphere that encircle Venus, Earth, and
Mars evolved much later as trapped gases were released from the
molten interiors of these planets.

formation of the protosun. Instead, chondrules must have been
produced by sudden, high-energy events that quickly melted material and then permitted it to cool. These events were probably
shock waves propagating through the gas of the solar nebula, like
the sonic booms produced by an airplane traveling faster than
sound. The sheer number of chondrules suggests that such shock
waves occurred throughout the inner solar nebula over a period
of more than 106 years. The words “cloud” and “nebula” may
suggest material moving in gentle orbits around the protosun; the
existence of chondrules suggests that conditions in the inner solar nebula were at times quite violent.

Simulating the Formation of Planets
Astronomers use computer simulations to learn how the inner
planets could have formed from planetesimals. A computer is programmed to simulate a large number of particles circling a newborn sun along orbits dictated by Newtonian mechanics. As the
simulation proceeds, the particles coalesce to form larger objects,
which in turn collide to form planets. By performing a variety of
simulations, each beginning with somewhat different numbers of
planetesimals in different orbits, it is possible to see what kinds
of planetary systems would have been created under different initial conditions. Such studies demonstrate that a wide range of initial conditions ultimately lead to basically the same result in the

inner solar system: Accretion continues for roughly 108 (100 million) years and typically forms four or five terrestrial planets with
orbits between 0.3 and 1.6 AU from the Sun.
Figure 8-12 shows one particular computer simulation. The
calculations began with 100 planetesimals, each having a mass
of 1.2 ⫻ 1023 kg. This choice ensures that the total mass (1.2 ⫻
1025 kg) equals the combined mass of the four terrestrial planets
(Mercury through Mars) plus their satellites. The initial orbits of
planetesimals are inclined to each other by angles of less than 5°
to simulate a thin layer of particles orbiting the protosun.
After an elapsed time simulating 30 million (3 ⫻ 107) years,
the 100 original planetesimals have merged into 22 protoplanets
(Figure 8-9b). After 79 million (7.9 ⫻ 107) years, these have combined into 11 larger protoplanets. Nearly another 100 million
(108) years elapse before further mergers leave just six growing
protoplanets. Finally, Figure 8-9c shows four planets following
nearly circular orbits after a total elapsed time of 441 million
(4.41 ⫻ 108) years. In this particular simulation, the fourth planet
from the Sun ends up being the most massive; in our own solar
system, the third planet (Earth) is the most massive of the terrestrial planets. Note that due to collisions, the four planets in the
simulation end up in orbits that are nearly circular, just like the
orbits of most of the planets in our solar system.

need to consider the conditions that
prevailed in the relatively cool outer
regions of the solar nebula. Two
leading models explain how the Jovian planets could have formed there.

8-6 Gases in the outer solar nebula formed
the Jovian planets, whose gravitational
influence gave rise to the small bodies
of the solar system
We have seen how the high temperatures in the inner solar nebula led to the formation of the small, rocky terrestrial planets. To
explain the very different properties of the Jovian planets, we

Low temperatures in the

grow to titanic size

The Core Accretion Model
Like the inner planets, the outer planets may have begun to form
by the accretion of planetesimals. The key difference is that ices
as well as rocky grains were able to survive in the outer regions
of the solar nebula, where temperatures were relatively low (see
Figure 8-10). The elements of which ices are made are much more
abundant than those that form rocky grains. Thus, much more
solid material would have been available to form planetesimals in
the outer solar nebula than in the inner part. As a result, solid objects several times larger than any of the terrestrial planets could
have formed in the outer solar nebula. Each such object, made up
of a mixture of ices and rocky material, could have become the
core of a Jovian planet and served as a “seed” around which the
rest of the planet eventually grew.
Thanks to the lower temperatures in the outer solar system,
gas atoms (principally hydrogen and helium) were moving relatively slowly and so could more easily be captured by the strong
gravity of these massive cores (see Box 7-2). Thus, the core of a
Jovian protoplanet could have captured an envelope of gas as it
continued to grow by accretion. This picture is called the core accretion model for the origin of the Jovian planets.
Calculations based on the core accretion model suggest that
both rocky materials and gas slowly accumulated for several million years, until the masses of the core and the envelope became
equal. From that critical moment on, the envelope pulled in all
the gas it could get, dramatically increasing the protoplanet’s
mass and size. This runaway growth of the protoplanet would
have continued until all the available gas was used up. The result

196

Chapter 8

was a huge planet with an enormously thick, hydrogen-rich envelope surrounding a rocky core with 5 to 10 times the mass of the
Earth. This scenario could have occurred at four different distances from the Sun, thus creating the four Jovian planets.
In the core accretion model, Uranus and Neptune probably
did not form at their present locations, respectively about 19 and
30 AU from the Sun. The solar nebula was too sparse at those
distances to allow these planets to have grown to the present-day
sizes. Instead, it is thought that Uranus and Neptune formed between 4 and 10 AU from the Sun, but were flung into larger orbits by gravitational interactions with Jupiter.

grains collide and clump together into planetesimals.

The Disk Instability Model

~ 1 km

An alternative model for the origin of the Jovian planets, the disk
instability model, suggests that they formed directly from the gas
of the solar nebula. If the gas of the outer solar nebula was not
smooth but clumpy, a sufficiently large and massive clump of gas
could begin to collapse inward all on its own, like the protosun
but on a smaller scale. Such a large clump would attract other
gas, forming a very large planet of hydrogen and helium within
just a few hundreds or thousands of years.
In the disk instability model the rocky core of a Jovian planet
is not the original nucleus around which the planet grew; rather,
it is the result of planetesimals and icy dust grains that were
drawn gravitationally into the planet and then settled at the
planet’s center. Another difference is that in the disk instability
model it is possible for Uranus and Neptune to have formed in
their present-day orbits, since they would have grown much more
rapidly than would be possible in the core accretion model.
Planetary scientists are actively researching whether the core
accretion model or the disk instability model is the more correct
description of the formation of the Jovian planets. In either case, we
can explain why the terrestrial planets formed in the inner solar
system while the Jovian planets formed in the outer solar system.
Figure 8-13 summarizes our overall picture of the formation
of the terrestrial and Jovian planets.

By contrast, trans-Neptunian objects (including Pluto
and the other objects shown in Table 7-4) began as icy
planetesimals beyond the orbit of Jupiter. The strong
gravitational forces from all of the Jovian planets pushed these
into orbits even further from the Sun, forming the immense ring
of the Kuiper belt (Figure 8-14). The images that open this chapter show two young stars surrounded by dusty disks, one seen
8.3

Like the terrestrial planets, the Jovian planets were quite a bit
hotter during their formation than they are today. A heated gas
expands, so these gas-rich planets must also have been much
larger than at present. As each planet cooled and contracted, it
would have formed a disk like a solar nebula in miniature (see
Figure 8-6). Many of the satellites of the Jovian planets, including those shown in Table 7-2, are thought to have formed from
ice particles and dust grains within these disks.
Jupiter, the most massive of the planets, was almost certainly
the first to form. This may explain why there are asteroids, transNeptunian objects, and comets (see Section 7-5). Jupiter’s tremendous mass would have exerted strong gravitational forces on any
nearby planetesimals. Some would have been sent crashing into
the Sun, while others would have been sent crashing into the terrestrial planets to form impact craters (see Section 7-6). Still others would have been ejected completely from the solar system.
Only a relatively few rocky planetesimals survived to produce the
present-day population of asteroids. Indeed, the mass of all known
asteroids combined is less than the mass of the Moon.

edge-on and the other seen face-on, that resemble the Kuiper belt.
As we saw in Section 7-5, the combined mass of all transNeptunian objects is hundreds of times larger than that of the asteroid belt, in part because the materials that form ices are much
more abundant than those that form rock.
Some of the smaller icy objects are thought to have been
pushed as far as 50,000 AU from the Sun, forming a spherical
“halo” around the solar system called the Oort cloud. From time
to time one of the smaller chunks of ice and rock from either the
Kuiper belt or the Oort cloud is deflected into the inner solar system. If one of these chunks comes close enough to the Sun, it be-

gins to evaporate, producing a visible tail and appearing as a
comet (see Figure 7-9).

The Final Stages of Solar System Evolution
While the planets, satellites, asteroids, and comets were forming,
the protosun was also evolving into a full-fledged star with nuclear reactions occurring in its core (see Section 1-3). The time required for this to occur was about 108 years, roughly the same as
that required for the formation of the terrestrial planets. Before
the onset of nuclear reactions, however, the young Sun probably
expelled a substantial portion of its mass into space (Figure 8-15).

Chapter 8

Magnetic fields within the solar nebula would have funneled a
portion of the nebula’s mass into oppositely directed jets along
the rotation axis of the nebula. Figure 8-15a shows one such jet
emanating from a young star.
In addition, instabilities within the young Sun would have
caused it to eject its tenuous outermost layers into space. This
brief but intense burst of mass loss, observed in many young stars
across the sky, is called a T Tauri wind, after the star in the constellation Taurus (the Bull) where it was first identified (see Figure 8-15b). Each of the protoplanetary disks in Figure 8-8 has a
T Tauri star at its center. (The present-day Sun also loses mass
from its outer layers in the form of high-speed electrons and protons, a flow called the solar wind. But this is minuscule compared
with a T Tauri wind, which causes a star to lose mass 106 to 107
times faster than in the solar wind.)
With the passage of time, the combined effects of jets, the
T Tauri wind, and accretion onto the planets would have swept
the solar system nearly clean of gas and dust. With no more interplanetary material to gather up, the planets would have stabilized at roughly their present-day sizes, and the formation of the
solar system would have been complete.
The Cosmic Connections figure summarizes our modern-day
picture of the origin of our solar system. Prior to 1995 the only
fully formed planetary system to which we could apply this model
was our own. As we will see in the next section, astronomers can
now further test this model on an ever-growing number of planets known to orbit other stars.

8-7 A variety of observational techniques
reveal planets around other stars
If planets formed around our Sun, have they formed around other
stars? That is, are there extrasolar planets orbiting stars other

than the Sun? Our model for the forSeveral stars are known
mation of the planets would seem to
suggest so. This model is based on to have systems of two
the laws of physics and chemistry, or more planets, but
which to the best of our understand- none of these resemble
ing are the same throughout the uni- our own solar system
verse. The discovery of a set of
planets orbiting another star, with
terrestrial planets in orbit close to the star and Jovian planets orbiting farther away, would be a tremendous vindication of our
theory of solar system formation. It would also tell us that our
planetary system is not unique in the universe. Because at least
one planet in our solar system—the Earth—has the ability to support life, perhaps other planetary systems could also harbor living organisms.
Since 1995 astronomers have in fact discovered about 200
planets orbiting stars other than the Sun. However, none of these
is a terrestrial planet. Most of them are more massive than Jupiter,
and some are in eccentric, noncircular orbits quite unlike planetary orbits in our solar system. To appreciate how remarkable
these discoveries are, we must look at the process that astronomers
go through to search for extrasolar planets.

Searching for Extrasolar Planets
It is very difficult to make direct observations of planets orbiting
other stars. The problem is that planets are small and dim compared with stars; at visible wavelengths, the Sun is 109 times
brighter than Jupiter and 1010 times brighter than the Earth. A
hypothetical planet orbiting a distant star, even a planet 10 times
larger than Jupiter, would be lost in the star’s glare as seen through
even the largest telescope on Earth.
Instead, indirect methods are used to search for extrasolar
planets. One very powerful method is to search for stars that appear to “wobble” (Figure 8-16). If a star has a planet, it is not

Extrasolar Planets: Surprising Masses and Orbits
Most of the extrasolar planets discovered by the radial velocity
method have masses comparable with or larger than that of Saturn, and thus are presumably Jovian planets made primarily of
hydrogen and helium. (This is difficult to confirm directly, because the spectra of the planets are very faint.) According to the
picture we presented in Section 8-5, such Jovian planets would be
expected to orbit relatively far from their stars, where temperatures were low enough to allow the buildup of a massive envelope of hydrogen and helium gas. But as Figure 8-17 shows, many
extrasolar planets are in fact found orbiting very close to their
stars. For example, the planet orbiting 51 Pegasi has a mass at
least 0.46 times that of Jupiter but orbits only 0.052 AU from its
star with an orbital period of just 4.23 days. In our own solar system, this orbit would lie well inside the orbit of Mercury!
Another surprising result is that many of the extrasolar planets found so far have orbits with very large eccentricities (see Figure 4-10b). As an example, the planet around the star 16 Cygni
B has an orbital eccentricity of 0.67; its distance from the star
varies between 0.55 AU and 2.79 AU. This is quite unlike planetary orbits in our own solar system, where no planet has an orbital eccentricity greater than 0.25.
Do these observations mean that our picture of how planets
form is incorrect? If Jupiterlike extrasolar planets such as that orbiting 51 Pegasi formed close to their stars, the mechanism of
their formation must have been very different from that which
operated in our solar system.
But another possibility is that extrasolar planets actually
formed at large distances from their stars and have migrated inward since their formation. If enough gas and dust remain in a
disk around a star after its planets form, interactions between the
disk material and an orbiting planet will cause the planet to lose
energy and to spiral inward toward the star around which it orbits. The planet’s inward migration can eventually stop because
of subtle gravitational effects from the disk or from the star.
Gravitational interactions between the planet and the disk, or between planets in the same planetary system, could also have forced
an extrasolar planet into a highly eccentric, noncircular orbit.

One piece of evidence that young planets may spiral inward toward their parent stars is the spectrum of the
star HD 82943, which has at least two planets orbiting it. The spectrum shows that this star’s atmosphere contains a
rare form of lithium that is found in planets, but which is destroyed in stars by nuclear reactions within 30 million years. The
presence of this exotic form of lithium, known as 6Li, means that
in the past HD 82943 was orbited by at least one other planet.

A different approach to the problem is the radial velocity method (Figure 8-16c). This is based on the
Doppler effect, which we described in Section 5-9. A
wobbling star will alternately move away from and toward the
Earth. This will cause the dark absorption lines in the star’s spectrum (see Figure 5-13) to change their wavelengths in a periodic
fashion. When the star is moving away from us, its spectrum will
undergo a redshift to longer wavelengths. When the star is approaching, there will be a blueshift of the spectrum to shorter
wavelengths. These wavelength shifts are very small because the
star’s motion around its orbit is quite slow. As an example, the
Sun moves around its small orbit at only 12.5 m/s (45 km/h, or
28 mi/h). If the Sun were moving directly toward an observer
at this speed, the hydrogen absorption line at a wavelength of
656 nm in the Sun’s spectrum would be shifted by only 2.6 ⫻
10⫺5 nm, or about 1 part in 25 million. Detecting these tiny shifts
requires extraordinarily careful measurements and painstaking
data analysis.
In 1995, Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz of the Geneva
Observatory in Switzerland announced that by using the radial
velocity method, they had discovered a planet orbiting the star
51 Pegasi, which is 47.9 light-years from the Sun in the constellation Pegasus (the Winged Horse). Their results were soon confirmed
by the team of Geoff Marcy of San Francisco State University and
Paul Butler of the University of California, Berkeley, using obser-

vations made at the University of California’s Lick Observatory.
For the first time, solid evidence had been found for a planet orbiting a star like our own Sun. Astronomers have since used the
radial velocity method to discover planets orbiting more than 160
other stars at distances up to 600 light-years from the Sun. In
at least 20 cases the star’s “wobble” is too complex to have
been caused by a single planet, so in these cases the star has a
multiple-planet system. Figure 8-17 depicts a selection of these
extrasolar planetary discoveries.

ANI

quite correct to say that the planet orbits the star. Rather, both
the planet and the star move in elliptical orbits around a point
called the center of mass. Imagine the planet and the star as sitting at opposite ends of a very long seesaw; the center of mass is
the point where you would have to place the fulcrum in order to
make the seesaw balance. Because of the star’s much greater mass,
the center of mass is much closer to the star than to the planet.
Thus, while the planet may move in an orbit that is hundreds of
millions of kilometers across, the star will move in a much smaller
orbit (Figure 8-16a).
As an example, the Sun and Jupiter both orbit their common
center of mass with an orbital period of 11.86 years. (Jupiter has
more mass than the other eight planets put together, so it is a reasonable approximation to consider the Sun’s wobble as being
due to Jupiter alone.) Jupiter’s orbit has a semimajor axis of
7.78 ⫻ 108 km, while the Sun’s orbit has a much smaller semimajor axis of 742,000 km. The Sun’s radius is 696,000 km, so the
Sun slowly wobbles around a point not far outside its surface. If
astronomers elsewhere in the Galaxy could detect the Sun’s wobbling motion, they could tell that there was a large planet (Jupiter)
orbiting the Sun. They could even determine the planet’s mass
and the size of its orbit, even though the planet itself was unseen.
Detecting the wobble of other stars is not an easy task. One
approach to the problem, called the astrometric method, involves
making very precise measurements of a star’s position in the sky
relative to other stars. The goal is to find stars whose positions
change in a cyclic way (Figure 8-16b). The measurements must be
made with very high accuracy (0.001 arcsec or better) and, ideally, over a long enough time to span an entire orbital period of
the star’s motion. Because this technique is so challenging to put
into practice, it has not yet led to any confirmed detections of extrasolar planets.

Analyzing Extrasolar Planets with the Transit Method

The radial velocity method gives us only a partial picture of what
extrasolar planets are like. It cannot give us precise values for a
planet’s mass, only a lower limit. (An exact determination of the

A technique called the transit method makes it possible
to fill in these blanks about the properties of certain extrasolar planets. This method looks for the rare situation in which a planet comes between us and its parent star, an
event called a transit (Figure 8-18). As in a partial solar eclipse (Section 3-5), this causes a small but measurable dimming of the star’s
light. If a transit is seen, the orbit must be nearly edge-on to our
line of sight. Knowing the orientation of the orbit, the information
obtained by radial velocity measurements of the star tells us the
true mass (not just a lower limit) of the orbiting planet. About 5%
of all known extrasolar planets undergo transits of their parent
8.7

Are all stars equally likely to have planets? The answer
appears to be no: Only about 5% of the stars surveyed
with the radial velocity method show evidence of planets. However, the percentage is 10% to 20% for stars in which
heavy elements are at least as abundant as in the Sun. The conclusion is that heavy elements appear to play an important role in
the evolution of planets from an interstellar cloud. This agrees
with the idea discussed in Section 8-5 that planetesimals (which
are composed of heavy elements) are the building blocks of planets.

mass would require knowing how the plane of the planet’s orbit
is inclined to our line of sight. Unfortunately, this angle is not
known because the planet itself is unseen.) Furthermore, the radial velocity method by itself cannot tell us the diameter of a
planet or what the planet is made of.

There are three other benefits of the transit method.
One, the amount by which the star is dimmed during
the transit depends on how large the planet is, and so
tells us the planet’s diameter (Figure 8-18a). Two, during the
transit the star’s light passes through the planet’s atmosphere,
where certain wavelengths are absorbed by the atmospheric gases.
This absorption affects the spectrum of starlight that we measure
and so allows us to determine the composition of the planet’s
atmosphere (Figure 8-18b). Three, with an infrared telescope it’s
possible to detect a slight dimming when the planet goes behind
the star (Figure 8-18c). That is because the planet emits infrared
radiation due to its own temperature, and this radiation is blocked

when the planet is behind the star. Measuring the amount of dimming tells us the amount of radiation emitted by the planet, which
in turn tells us the planet’s surface temperature.
One example of what the transit method can tell us is about
the planet that orbits the star HD 209458, which is 153 lightyears from the Sun. The mass of this planet is 0.69 that of Jupiter,
but its diameter is 1.32 times larger than that of Jupiter. This
low-mass, large-volume planet thus has only one-quarter the
density of Jupiter. It is also very hot: Because the planet orbits
just 0.047 AU from the star, its surface temperature is a torrid
1130 K (860°C, or 1570°F). Observations of the spectrum during a transit reveal the presence of hydrogen, carbon, oxygen,
and sodium in a planetary atmosphere that is literally evaporating away in the intense starlight. Discoveries such as these give
insight into the exotic circumstances that can be found in other
planetary systems.

Other Techniques for Discovering Extrasolar Planets
In 2004 astronomers began to use a property of space discovered
by Albert Einstein as a tool for detecting extrasolar planets. Einstein’s general theory of relativity makes the remarkable statement that a star’s gravity can deflect the path of a light beam just
as it deflects the path of a planet or spacecraft. If a star drifts
through the line of sight between Earth and a more distant star,
the closer star’s gravity acts like a lens that focuses the more distant star’s light. Such microlensing causes the distant star’s image
as seen in a telescope to become brighter. If the closer star has a
planet, the planet’s gravity will cause a secondary brightening
whose magnitude depends on the planet’s mass (Figure 8-19). Using this technique astronomers have detected a handful of extrasolar planets at distances up to 21,000 light-years, and expect to
find many more.
Since 2004 astronomers have also been able to record images
of a few extrasolar planets. At infrared wavelengths a star outshines a Jupiter-sized planet by only about 100 to 1, compared to
109 to 1 at visible wavelengths. Hence, by using an infrared telescope aided by adaptive optics (Section 6-3) it is possible to resolve both a star and its planet if the two are sufficiently far apart.
Figure 8-20 shows an infrared image of the star 2M1207 and its
planet. Unlike planets detected with the radial velocity or transit
method, it is impractical to watch this planet go through a complete orbit: It is so far from its parent star that the orbital period
is more than a thousand years. Instead, astronomers verify that it
is a planet by confirming that the star and planet move together

Star 2M1207

through space, as they must do if they are held together by their
mutual gravitational attraction. While it is not possible to measure the planet’s mass directly, the spectrum and brightness of the
planet tell astronomers its surface temperature and diameter.

The Search for Earthlike Planets
If there are planets orbiting other stars, are there any that resemble our own Earth? As of this writing we do not know the answer to this question. An Earth-sized planet has such weak gravity
that it can produce only a tiny “wobble” in its parent star, making it very difficult to detect such planets using the radial velocity method. If an Earth-sized planet were to transit its parent star,
its diameter is so small that it would cause only a miniscule dimming of the star’s light. For these reasons, as of this writing, astronomers have been unable to detect extrasolar planets less
massive than 7.5 Earth masses.
In the near future, however, orbiting telescopes being planned
by both NASA and the European Space Agency (ESA) will search
for terrestrial planets around other stars. One such orbiting telescope, scheduled for launch in 2008, is NASA’s Kepler, which
will use a one-meter telescope and sensitive detectors to look for
transits of Earth-sized planets within a narrow patch of sky.
An even broader search for extrasolar planets will be carried
out by ESA’s Gaia mission, scheduled for launch in 2011. Gaia
will survey a billion (109) stars—1% of all the stars in the Milky
Way Galaxy—and will be able to detect star “wobbles” as small
as 2 ⫻ 10⫺6 arcsec. With such high-precision data the astrometric method (Figure 8-16b) will finally come into its own. Astronomers estimate that Gaia will find from 10,000 to 50,000
Jupiter-sized planets. If our solar system is fairly typical, a substantial number of these planets should move around their parent
stars in orbits like those of the Jovian planets around the Sun,
with semimajor axes greater than 3 AU and low eccentricities. If
Gaia finds such planetary systems that resemble our own, they
will be natural places to look for Earth-sized planets. The next few
decades may tell whether our own solar system is an exception or
just one of a host of similar systems throughout the Galaxy.

Key Ideas
Models of Solar System Formation: The most successful model of
the origin of the solar system is called the nebular hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, the solar system formed from a cloud
of interstellar material called the solar nebula. This occurred
4.56 billion years ago (as determined by radioactive dating).
The Solar Nebula and Its Evolution: The chemical composition of
the solar nebula, by mass, was 98% hydrogen and helium (elements that formed shortly after the beginning of the universe) and
2% heavier elements (produced much later in the centers of stars,
and cast into space when the stars died). The heavier elements
were in the form of ice and dust particles.
• The nebula flattened into a disk in which all the material orbited the center in the same direction, just as do the present-day
planets.
Formation of the Planets and Sun: The terrestrial planets, the
Jovian planets, and the Sun followed different pathways to
formation.
• The four terrestrial planets formed through the accretion of dust
particles into planetesimals, then into larger protoplanets.
• In the core accretion model, the four Jovian planets began as
rocky protoplanetary cores, similar in character to the terrestrial
planets. Gas then accreted onto these cores in a runaway fashion.
• In the alternative disk instability model, the Jovian planets
formed directly from the gases of the solar nebula. In this model
the cores formed from planetesimals falling into the planets.
• The Sun formed by gravitational contraction of the center of the
nebula. After about 108 years, temperatures at the protosun’s center became high enough to ignite nuclear reactions that convert
hydrogen into helium, thus forming a true star.
Extrasolar Planets: Astronomers have discovered planets orbiting
other stars.
• Most of these planets are detected by the “wobble” of the stars
around which they orbit.
• A small but growing number of extrasolar planets have been
discovered by the transit method, by microlensing, and direct
imaging.
• Most of the extrasolar planets discovered to date are quite massive and have orbits that are very different from planets in our solar system.

Alien Planets
by Geoff Marcy
stronomers have now surveyed 2000 nearby stars in
the search for orbiting planets. My team is using the
10-meter Keck telescope in Hawaii to measure the
Doppler effect in stars that wobble because of planets orbiting
around them. So far, we and other teams have found more
than 200 planets, some more massive than Jupiter and some
less massive than Neptune. We have now found 20 stars that
have multiple planets orbiting them—full planetary systems.
Often the planets orbit synchronously, with one planet orbiting the star two or three times for every orbit of another planet.
This synchronization of the planets allows gravity to shepherd
their motion, keeping them synchronized forever.
We hope to compare the architecture of these planetary
systems to that of our own solar system. Is our solar system a
common type? Do all planetary systems have giant planets orbiting far away from the host star, with small rocky planets
orbiting close in?
Remarkably, the planetary systems observed so far seem
very different from our own solar system. In some, a giant
planet orbits very close to the star. More surprising is that almost every alien planet that orbits beyond 0.1 AU from its star
resides in a highly elliptical orbit that resembles eccentric comet
orbits. Why are these planets in such elliptical orbits so different from the nearly circular orbits of planets in our own solar
system? Astronomers are baffled by this difference. One possibility is that planets usually form as close-knit families around
a star. Over time, the planets may gravitationally pull on one

A

When Geoff Marcy sat down to write this essay, more
than 200 planets were known to orbit other stars. He
leads the team that has found more than 120 of them.
Dr. Marcy became interested in astronomy at the age of 14, when
his parents bought him a small reflecting telescope. Since
receiving his Ph.D. from the University of California, Santa Cruz, he
has studied stars similar to our Sun. He helped show that magnetic
regions on their surfaces cause “star spots” and stellar flares.
He also showed that brown dwarfs—stars too small to burn
hydrogen—rarely orbit other stars. His work may soon reveal
whether a planetary system like ours is common or a quirk of the
cosmos. Dr. Marcy is an astronomer at the University of California,
Berkeley.

another, yanking themselves out of their original circular orbits. These perturbed planets may then venture near other
planets, yanking on them, too. Many of the planets may gravitationally slingshot each other completely out of the planetary
system. These far flung planets are destined to roam the darkness of galactic space, cooling to frigid temperatures that are
inhospitable to life.
The extrasolar planets cast a mystery back on the Earth.
Why is our solar system immune to this chaotic episode that
scatters planets into wacky orbits? Imagine the disaster if our
Earth were suddenly thrust into a highly elliptical orbit. During half the year, we would be roasting too close to the Sun,
with oceans vaporized into an enormous steam bath. The other
half of the year our orbit would carry us too far from the Sun,
causing all the oceans to freeze over. Life on Earth would be
severely challenged to survive in such an elongated orbit.
Why are we humans so lucky as to live in a stable planetary system in which circular orbits ensure that we receive the
same warming light intensity from our Sun, all year round?
Perhaps the question to ask is: Would life have evolved here if
the Earth suffered from wild temperature swings that would
make liquid water rare? After all, intelligent life might not have
evolved here if the Earth suffered from wild temperature swings
that would make liquid water rare. We humans, and species in
general, may flourish mostly on worlds that maintain nearly
constant temperature. If so, our solar system and the Earth
might be a rare galactic quirk that just happens to be suitable
for life. We wouldn’t be here otherwise. If this picture is correct, our Earth is indeed a precious oasis in our Milky Way
Galaxy.
In the next few years, we plan to use the Doppler technique to discover planets having masses only 10 or 20 times
that of our Earth. These would likely be rocky planets, allowing liquid water to puddle in ponds and lakes. Who knows
what biology might emerge in such extraterrestrial chemistry
labs! In the next decade, we will discover more planetary systems by using the Doppler method. We are working night and
day to find Jovian planets that orbit 5 AU from their stars,
similar to the orbital radius of our Jupiter. Their orbits, circular or elliptical, will shed light on a key question: How common are configurations like our solar system, and how common
is advanced life in the universe?

hen astronauts made the first journeys from the Earth to
the Moon between 1968 and 1972, they often reported
that our planet is the most beautiful sight visible from
space. Of all the worlds of the solar system, only Earth has the
distinctive green color of vegetation, and only Earth has liquid
water on its surface. Compared with the Moon, whose lifeless,
dry surface has been ravaged by billions of years of impacts by
interplanetary debris, the Earth seems an inviting and tranquil
place.
Yet the appearance of tranquility is deceiving. The seemingly
solid surface of the planet is in a state of slow but constant motion, driven by the flow of molten rock within the Earth’s interior. Sunlight provides the Earth’s atmosphere with the energy
that drives our planet’s sometimes violent weather, including all
the cloud patterns visible in the images shown here.
Unseen in these images are immense clouds of subatomic particles that wander around the outside of the planet in two giant
belts, held in thrall by the Earth’s magnetic field. And equally unseen are trace gases in the Earth’s atmosphere whose abundance
may determine the future of our climate, and on which may depend the survival of entire species.
In this chapter our goal is to learn about the Earth’s components—
its dynamic oceans and atmosphere, its ever-changing surface,
and its hot, active interior—and how they interact to make up our
planetary home. In later chapters we will use this knowledge as a
point of reference for studying the Moon and the other planets.

Dynamic Earth: Water, Air, and Land
Unlike the arid surfaces of Venus and Mars, the Earth’s surface is
very wet. Indeed, nearly 71% of the Earth’s surface is covered
with water (Figure 9-1). Water is also
locked into the chemical structure of To understand our
many Earth rocks, including those dynamic planet, we must

more, the Earth’s liquid water is in sources that power its
constant motion. The oceans ebb and activity

flow down to the sea, and storms whip lake waters into a frenzy.
The Earth’s atmosphere is also in a state of perpetual activity. Winds blow at all altitudes, with speeds and directions that
change from one hour to the next. The atmosphere is at its most

dynamic when water evaporates to form clouds, then returns to
the surface as rain or snow (Figure 9-2). While other worlds of
the solar system have atmospheres, only the Earth’s contains the
oxygen that animals (including humans) need to sustain life.
The combined effects of water and wind cause erosion of
mountains and beaches. But these are by no means the only forces
reshaping the face of our planet. All across the Earth we find evidence that the surface has been twisted, deformed, and folded
(Figure 9-3). What is more, new material is continually being
added to the Earth’s surface as lava pours forth from volcanoes
and from immense cracks in the ocean floors. At the same time,
other geologic activity slowly pushes old surface material back
into our planet’s interior. These processes and others work together to renew and refresh our planet’s exterior. Thus, although
the Earth is some 4.56 billion (4.56 ⫻ 109) years old, much of its
surface is a few hundred million (a few times 108) years old (Figure 9-4). (We saw in Section 8-2 how scientists use radioactive
dating to determine the ages of rocks and of the Earth as a whole.)

Earth’s Energy Sources

What powers all of this activity in the Earth’s oceans, atmosphere, and surface? There are three energy sources: radiation
from the Sun, the tidal effects of the Moon, and the Earth’s own
internal heat (Table 9-2).

Chapter 9

The Sun is the principal source of energy for the atmosphere.
The Earth’s surface is warmed by sunlight, which in turn warms
the air next to the surface. Hot air is less dense than cool air and
so tends to rise (see the discussion of density in Box 7-1). As the
air rises, it transfers heat to its surroundings. As a result, the rising air cools and becomes denser. It then sinks downward to be
heated again, and the process starts over. This up-and-down motion is called convection, and the overall pattern of circulation is
called a convection current. (You can see convection currents in
action by heating water on a stove, as Figure 9-5 shows.) In Section 9-5 we will see how the Earth’s rotation modifies the up-anddown motion of the atmosphere to produce a pattern of global
circulation.
Solar energy also powers atmospheric activity by evaporating
water from the surface. The energy in the water vapor is released
when it condenses to form water droplets, like those that make
up clouds. In a typical thunderstorm (see Figure 9-2), some
5 ⫻ 108 kg of water vapor is lifted to great heights. The amount
of energy released when this water condenses is as much as a city
of 100,000 people uses in a month!
Solar energy also helps to power the oceans. Warm water
from near the equator moves toward the poles, while cold polar
water returns toward the equator. As we saw in Section 4-8, however, there is back-and-forth motion of the oceans due to the tidal
forces of the Moon and Sun. Sometimes these two influences can
reinforce each other, as when a storm (caused by solar energy)
reaches a coastline at high tide (caused by tidal forces), producing waves strong enough to seriously erode beaches and sea cliffs.
Neither solar energy nor tidal forces can explain the reshaping of the Earth’s surface suggested by Figure 9-3. Rather, all geologic activity is powered by heat flowing from the interior of the
Earth itself. The Earth formed by collisions among planetesimals

Figure 9-5
Convection in the Kitchen Heat supplied to the bottom of a pot warms
the water there, making the water expand and lowering its average
density. This low-density water rises and transfers heat to its cooler
surroundings. The water that began at the bottom thus cools down,
becomes denser, and sinks back to the bottom to repeat the process.

Earth, 4th ed., W. H. Freeman, 2004)

(see Section 8-4), and these collisions heated the body of the
Earth. The interior remains hot to this day. An additional source
of heat is the decay of radioactive elements such as uranium and
thorium deep inside the Earth.
The heat flow from the Earth’s interior to its surface is
minuscule—just 1/6000 as great as the flow of energy we receive
from the Sun—but it has a profound effect on the face of our
planet. In Sections 9-2 and 9-3 we will explore the interior structure of the Earth and discover the connection between geologic
activity on the Earth’s surface and heat coming from its interior.

The Earth’s Surface Temperature and
the Greenhouse Effect
Since so little heat comes from inside our planet, the average surface temperature of the Earth depends almost entirely on the
amount of energy that reaches us from the Sun in the form of
electromagnetic radiation. (In an analogous way, whether you feel
warm or cool outdoors on a summer day depends on whether you
are in the sunlight and receiving lots of solar energy or in the
shade and receiving little of this energy.)
If the Earth did nothing but absorb radiation from the Sun,
it would get hotter and hotter until the surface temperature became high enough to melt rock. Happily, there are two reasons
why this does not happen. One is that the clouds, snow, ice, and
sand reflect about 31% of the incoming sunlight back into space.
The fraction of incoming sunlight that a planet reflects is called
its albedo (from the Latin for “whiteness”); thus the Earth’s
albedo is about 0.31. Thus, only 69% of the incoming solar energy is absorbed by the Earth. A second reason is that the Earth
also emits radiation into space because of its temperature, in accordance with the laws that describe heated dense objects (see
Section 5-3). The Earth’s average surface temperature is nearly
constant, which means that on the whole it is neither gaining nor
losing energy. Thus, the rate at which the Earth emits energy into
space must equal the rate at which it absorbs energy from the Sun.
To better understand this balance between absorbed and
emitted radiation, remember that Wien’s law tells us that the
wavelength at which such an object emits most strongly (␭max) is
inversely proportional to its temperature (T ) on the Kelvin scale
(see Section 5-4 and Box 5-2). For example, the Sun’s surface
temperature is about 5800 K, and sunlight has its greatest intensity at a wavelength ␭max of 500 nm, in the middle of the visible
spectrum. The Earth’s average surface temperature of 287 K is far
lower than the Sun’s, so the Earth radiates most strongly at longer
wavelengths in the infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. The Stefan-Boltzmann law tells us that temperature also determines the amount of radiation that the Earth emits: The higher
the temperature, the more energy it radiates.
Given the amount of energy reaching us from the Sun each
second as well as the Earth’s albedo, we can calculate the amount
of solar energy that the Earth should absorb each second. Since
this must equal the amount of electromagnetic energy that the
Earth emits each second, which in turn depends on the Earth’s average surface temperature, we can calculate what the Earth’s average surface temperature should be. The result is a very chilly
254 K (⫺19°C ⫽ ⫺2°F), so cold that oceans and lakes around the
world should be frozen over. In fact, the Earth’s actual average
surface temperature is 287 K (14°C ⫽ 57°F). What is wrong with
our model? Why is the Earth warmer than we would expect?

The Greenhouse Effect Sunlight warms the Earth’s
surface, which due to its temperature emits infrared
radiation. Much of this radiation is absorbed by atmospheric water
vapor and carbon dioxide, helping to raise the average temperature of
the surface. Some infrared radiation does penetrate the atmosphere
and leaks into space. In a state of equilibrium, the rate at which the
Earth loses energy to space in this way is equal to the rate at which it
absorbs energy from the Sun.

9-2 Studies of earthquakes reveal the
Earth’s layered interior structure
The kinds of rocks found on and near the Earth’s surface provide
an important clue about our planet’s interior. The densities of

An Iron-Rich Planet
Iron (chemical symbol Fe) is a good candidate for the substance
that makes up most of the Earth’s interior. This is so for two reasons. First, iron atoms are quite massive (a typical iron atom has
56 times the mass of a hydrogen atom), and second, iron is relatively abundant. (Figure 8-4 shows that it is the seventh most
abundant element in our part of the Milky Way Galaxy.) Other
elements such as lead and uranium have more massive atoms, but
these elements are quite rare. Hence, the solar nebula could not
have had enough of these massive atoms to create the Earth’s
dense interior. Furthermore, iron is common in meteoroids that
strike the Earth, which suggests that it was abundant in the planetesimals from which the Earth formed.
The Earth was almost certainly molten throughout its volume
soon after its formation, about 4.56 ⫻ 109 years ago. Energy released by the violent impacts of numerous meteoroids and asteroids and by the decay of radioactive isotopes likely melted the
solid material collected from the earlier planetesimals. Gravity
caused abundant, dense iron to sink toward the Earth’s center,
forcing less dense material to the surface. Figure 9-7a shows this
process of chemical differentiation. (We discussed chemical differentiation in Section 8-4.) The result was a planet with the layered
structure shown in Figure 9-7b—a central core composed of almost pure iron, surrounded by a mantle of dense, iron-rich minerals. The mantle, in turn, is surrounded by a thin crust of
relatively light silicon-rich minerals. We live on the surface of this
crust.

Seismic Waves as Earth Probes
How do we know that this layered structure is correct? The challenge in testing this model is that the Earth’s interior is as inaccessible as the most distant galaxies in space. The deepest wells
go down only a few kilometers, barely penetrating the surface of
our planet. Despite these difficulties, geologists have learned basic properties of the Earth’s interior by studying earthquakes and
the seismic waves that they produce.

Over the centuries, stresses build up in the Earth’s
crust. Occasionally, these stresses are relieved with a
sudden motion called an earthquake. Most earthquakes
occur deep within the Earth’s crust. The point on the Earth’s surface directly over an earthquake’s location is called the epicenter.
Earthquakes produce three different kinds of seismic waves,
which travel around or through the Earth in different ways and
at different speeds. Geologists use sensitive instruments called
seismographs to detect and record these vibratory motions. The
first type of wave, which is analogous to water waves on the
ocean, causes the rolling motion that people feel around an
epicenter. These are called surface waves because they travel only
.3

The explanation for this discrepancy is called the greenhouse
effect: Our atmosphere prevents some of the radiation emitted by
the Earth’s surface from escaping into space. Certain gases in our
atmosphere called greenhouse gases, among them water vapor
and carbon dioxide, are transparent to visible light but not to infrared radiation. Consequently, visible sunlight has no trouble entering our atmosphere and warming the surface. But the infrared
radiation coming from the heated surface is partially trapped by
the atmosphere, thus raising the temperatures of both the atmosphere and the surface. As the surface and atmosphere become
hotter, they both emit more infrared radiation, part of which is
able to escape into space. The temperature levels off when the
amount of infrared energy that escapes just balances the amount
of solar energy reaching the surface (Figure 9-6). The result is that
our planet’s surface is some 33°C (59°F) warmer than it would
be without the greenhouse effect, and water remains unfrozen
over most of the Earth.
The warming caused by the greenhouse effect gives our planet
the moderate temperatures needed for the existence of life. For
over a century, however, our technological civilization has been
adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere at an unprecedented
rate. As we will see in Section 9-7, the likely consequences to our
climate are extremely grave.

much denser than those found near the surface. But what is this

Seismic Waves Earthquakes produce two kinds of waves
that travel through the body of our planet. One kind, called P
waves, are longitudinal waves. They are analogous to those produced by
pushing a spring in and out. The other kind, S waves, are transverse
waves analogous to the waves produced by shaking a rope up and down.

(b) As a result of differentiation, the Earth has
the layered structure that we see today

because of the varying density and composition of the Earth’s interior. We saw in Section 6-1 that light waves behave in a very
similar way. Just as light waves bend, or refract, when they pass
from air into glass or vice versa (see Figure 6-2), seismic waves
refract as they pass through different parts of the Earth’s interior.
By studying how the paths of these waves bend, geologists can
map out the general interior structure of the Earth.
One key observation about seismic waves and how they bend
has to do with the differences between S and P waves. When an
earthquake occurs, seismographs relatively close to the epicenter
record both S and P waves, but seismometers on the opposite side
of Earth record only P waves. The absence of S waves was first explained in 1906 by British geologist Richard Dixon Oldham, who
noted that transverse vibrations such as S waves cannot travel far
through liquids. Oldham therefore concluded that our planet has
a molten core. Furthermore, there is a region in which neither
S waves nor P waves from an earthquake can be detected (Figure
9-9). This “shadow zone” results from the specific way in which
P waves are refracted at the boundary between the solid mantle and
the molten core. By measuring the size of the shadow zone, geologists have concluded that the radius of the molten core is about
3500 km (2200 mi), about 55% of our planet’s overall radius but
about double the radius of the Moon (1738 km ⫽ 1080 mi).
As the quality and sensitivity of seismographs improved, geologists discovered faint traces of P waves in an earthquake’s shadow
zone. In 1936, the Danish seismologist Inge Lehmann explained
that some of the P waves passing through the Earth are deflected
into the shadow zone by a small, solid inner core at the center of
our planet. The radius of this inner core is about 1300 km (800 mi).

over the Earth’s surface. The two other kinds of waves, called
P waves (for “primary”) and S waves (for “secondary”), travel
through the interior of the Earth. P waves are called longitudinal
waves because their oscillations are parallel to the direction of
wave motion, like a spring that is alternately pushed and pulled.
In contrast, S waves are called transverse waves because their vibrations are perpendicular to the direction in which the waves
move. S waves are analogous to waves produced by a person
shaking a rope up and down (Figure 9-8).
What makes seismic waves useful for learning about the
Earth’s interior is that they do not travel in straight lines. Instead,
the paths that they follow through the body of the Earth are bent

The Earth’s outermost layer, the crust, is only about 5 to
35 km thick. It is composed of rocks for which the melting point,
or temperature at which the rock changes from solid to liquid, is
far higher than the temperatures actually found in the crust. Thus,
the crust is solid.
The Earth’s mantle, which extends to a depth of about
2900 km (1800 mi), is largely composed of substances rich in
iron and magnesium. On the Earth’s surface, specimens of these
substances have melting points slightly over 1000°C. However,
the melting point of a substance depends on the pressure to which
it is subjected—the higher the pressure, the higher the melting
point. As Figure 9-10 shows, the actual temperatures throughout
most of the mantle are less than the melting point of all the substances of which the mantle is made. Hence, the mantle is primarily solid. However, the upper levels of the mantle—called the
asthenosphere (from the Greek asthenia, meaning “weakness”)—
are able to flow slowly and are therefore referred to as being
plastic.

Figure 9-9
The Earth’s Internal Structure and the Paths of Seismic Waves
Seismic waves follow curved paths because of differences in the density
and composition of the material in the Earth’s interior. The paths curve
gradually where there are gradual changes in density and composition.
Sharp bends occur only where there is an abrupt change from one kind of
material to another, such as at the boundary between the outer core and
the mantle. Only P waves can pass through the Earth’s liquid outer core.

this arrangement, we must look at how temperature and pressure
inside the Earth affect the melting point of rock.
Both temperature and pressure increase with increasing depth
below the Earth’s surface. The temperature of the Earth’s interior
rises steadily from about 14°C on the surface to nearly 5000°C
at our planet’s center (Figure 9-10).

as one that is able to flow. Normally we think of plastic objects
as being hard and solid, like the plastic out of which compact
discs and video cassettes are made. But to make these objects,
the plastic material is heated so that it can flow into a mold,
then cooled so that it solidifies. Strictly, the material is only
“plastic” when it is able to flow. Maple syrup and tree sap are
two other substances that flow at warm temperatures but become solid when cooled.
At the boundary between the mantle and the outer core, there
is an abrupt change in chemical composition, from silicon-rich
materials to almost-pure iron with a small admixture of nickel.
Because this nearly pure iron has a lower melting point than the
iron-rich materials, the melting curve in Figure 9-10 has a “jog”
as it crosses from the mantle to the outer core and remains. As a
result, the melting point is less than the temperature at depths of
about 2900 to 5100 km (1800 to 3200 mi), and the outer core is
liquid.
At depths greater than about 5100 km, the pressure is more
than 1011 newtons per square meter. This is about 106 times ordinary atmospheric pressure, or about 104 tons per square inch.
Because the melting point of the iron-nickel mixture under this
pressure is higher than the actual temperature (see Figure 9-10),
the Earth’s inner core is solid.

Until the 1980s, geologists knew little more about the
inner core than that it is solid and dense. Since then,
evidence has accumulated that suggests the inner core
is a single crystal of iron—that is, iron atoms arranged in orderly
rows, like carbon atoms are arranged within a diamond. If so, the
inner core is the largest crystalline object anywhere in the solar
system. Furthermore, there are strong indications that the inner
core is rotating at a slightly faster rate than the rest of the Earth!
These remarkable discoveries suggest that even more surprises
may lurk deep within the Earth’s interior.
Heat naturally flows from where the temperature is high to
where it is low. Figure 9-10 thus explains why there is a heat flow
from the center of the Earth outward. We will see in the next section how this heat flow acts as the “engine” that powers our
planet’s geologic activity.

Fitting the Continents Together Africa, Europe, Greenland, North America,
and South America fit together remarkably well. The fit is especially convincing
if the edges of the continental shelves (shown in yellow) are used, rather than
today’s shorelines. This strongly suggests that these continents were in fact
joined together at some point in the past. (Adapted from P. M. Hurley)

Figure 9-12
The Breakup of the Supercontinent Pangaea (a) The shapes of the
continents led Alfred Wegener to conclude that more than 200 million
(2 ⫻ 108) years ago, the continents were merged into a single
supercontinent, which he called Pangaea. (b) Pangaea first split into two
smaller land masses, Laurasia and Gondwana. (c) Over millions of years,

the continents moved to their present-day locations. Among the evidence
confirming this picture are nearly identical rock formations 200 million
years in age that today are thousands of kilometers apart but would have
been side by side on Pangaea. (Adapted from F. Press, R. Siever, T. Grotzinger,

ther side of the Atlantic Ocean is quite remarkable. This observation inspired the German meteorologist Alfred Wegener to advocate “continental drift”—the idea that the continents on either
side of the Atlantic Ocean have simply drifted apart. After much
research, in 1915 Wegener published the theory that there had
originally been a single gigantic supercontinent, which he called
Pangaea (meaning “all lands”), that began to break up and drift
apart roughly 200 million years ago. (No humans were present to
witness this; the earliest humans did not appear on Earth until
about 1.9 million years ago. At the time that Pangaea broke up,
during what geologists refer to as the early Jurassic period, dinosaurs were the dominant land animals.)
Other geologists refined this theory, arguing that Pangaea
must have first split into two smaller supercontinents, which they
called Laurasia and Gondwana, separated by what they called the
Tethys Ocean. Gondwana later split into Africa and South America, with Laurasia dividing to become North America and Eurasia. According to this theory, the Mediterranean Sea is a surviving
remnant of the ancient Tethys Ocean (Figure 9-12).
Initially, most geologists ridiculed Wegener’s ideas. Although
it was generally accepted that the continents do “float” on the
denser, somewhat plastic mantle beneath them, few geologists
could accept the idea that entire continents could move around
the Earth at speeds as great as several centimeters per year. The
“continental drifters” could not explain what forces could be
shoving the massive continents around.

The upwelling of new material from the mantle to the crust
forces the existing crusts apart, causing seafloor spreading. For example, the floor of the Atlantic Ocean to the east of the MidAtlantic Ridge is moving eastward and the floor to the west is moving westward. By explaining what fills in the gap between continents as they move apart, seafloor spreading helps to fill out the

Beginning in the mid-1950s, however, geologists found
evidence that material is being forced upward to the
crust from deep within the Earth. Bruce C. Heezen of
Columbia University and his colleagues began discovering long
mountain ranges on the ocean floors, such as the Mid-Atlantic
Ridge, which stretches all the way from Iceland to Antarctica
(Figure 9-13). During the 1960s, Harry Hess of Princeton University and Robert Dietz of the University of California again carefully examined the floor of the Atlantic Ocean. They concluded
that rock from the Earth’s mantle is being melted and then forced
upward along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, which is in essence a long
chain of underwater volcanoes.

Ridge, an immense mountain ridge that rises up from the floor of the

activity. Most earthquakes occur where plates separate, collide, or rub

theories of continental drift. Because of the seafloor spreading from
the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, South America and Africa are moving
apart at a speed of roughly 3 cm per year. Working backward,
these two continents would have been next to each other some 200
million years ago—just as Wegener suggested (see Figure 9-11).
In the early 1960s, geologists began to find additional evidence supporting the existence of large, moving plates. Thus was
born the modern theory of crustal motion, which came to be
known as plate tectonics (from the Greek tekton, meaning
“builder”).
Geologists today realize that earthquakes tend to occur at the
boundaries of the Earth’s crustal plates, where the plates are colliding, separating, or rubbing against each other. The boundaries
of the plates therefore stand out clearly when the epicenters of
earthquakes are plotted on a map, as in Figure 9-14.

What makes the plates move? The answer is twofold.
First, heat flows outward from the Earth’s hot core to
its cool crust, and second, this heat flows through the

Earth’s atmosphere: When water vapor in the air cools and forms
liquid drops, it releases the energy that powers thunderstorms.)
The asthenosphere, or upper level of the mantle, is hot and soft
enough to permit an oozing, plastic flow. Atop the asthenosphere is
a rigid layer, called the lithosphere (from the Greek word for “rock.”)
The lithosphere is divided into plates that ride along the convection
currents of the asthenosphere. The crust is simply the uppermost
layer of the lithosphere, with a somewhat different chemical composition than the lithosphere’s lower regions.
Figure 9-16 shows how convection causes plate movement.
Molten subsurface rock seeps upward along oceanic rifts, where
plates are separating. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge, shown in Figure
9-13, is an oceanic rift. Where plates collide, cool crustal material
from one of the plates sinks back down into the mantle along a
subduction zone. One such subduction zone is found along the
west coast of South America, where the oceanic Nazca plate is being subducted into the mantle under the continental South American plate at a relatively speedy 10 centimeters per year. As the
material from the subducted plate sinks, it pulls the rest of its plate
along with it, thus helping to keep the plates in motion. New material is added to the crust from the mantle at the oceanic rifts and
is “recycled” back into the mantle at the subduction zones. In this
way the total amount of crust remains essentially the same.

(a) Igneous rock (basalt)

Figure 9-19

(b) Sedimentary rock (sandstone)

Geologic processes create three major categories of
rocks (Figure 9-19). Igneous rocks result when minerals cool from a molten state. (Molten rock is called
magma when it is buried below the surface and lava when it flows
out upon the surface, as in a volcanic eruption.) The ocean floor
is made predominantly of a type of igneous rock called basalt
(Figure 9-19a). This is just what we would expect if the ocean floor
is produced by material welling up from the mantle, as predicted
by the theory of seafloor spreading.
Sedimentary rocks are produced by the action of wind, water, or ice. For example, winds can pile up layer upon layer of
sand grains. Other minerals present amid the sand can gradually
cement the grains together to produce sandstone (Figure 9-19b).
Minerals that precipitate out of the oceans can cover the ocean
floor with layers of a sedimentary rock called limestone. The motion of tectonic plates can move such rocks to places far from
where they were formed. This explains why sedimentary rock
from the floor of an ancient ocean can now be found in central
Alaska and as hogback ridges in Colorado (see Figure 9-3).
Sometimes igneous or sedimentary rocks become buried far
beneath the surface, where they are subjected to enormous pressure and high temperatures. These severe conditions change the
structure of the rocks, producing metamorphic rock (Figure 9-19c).
The presence of metamorphic rocks at the Earth’s surface tells us
that tectonic activity sometimes lifts up material from deep within
the crust. This can happen when two plates collide, as shown in
Figure 9-18. The boundaries of the colliding plates are thrust upward to form a new chain of mountains, and buried metamorphic
rocks are brought to the surface.

the solar wind
We saw in Section 7-7 that Earth’s
magnetic field provides evidence that Like the motions of
our planet’s interior is partially tectonic plates, the

the magnetic field is produced by the results from our planet’s
motion of iron-rich material in the internal heat
liquid outer core. Because this material is a good conductor of electricity, its motions generate a magnetic field in a mechanism called a dynamo.

The Source of Earth’s Magnetic Field
The same energy source that powers plate tectonics is also responsible for the Earth’s dynamo. As we saw in Section 9-3, energy is released when material from our planet’s liquid core
cools and solidifies onto the solid core. This released energy
stirs up the motions of the liquid core, and these motions generate a magnetic field. (While there is also fluid motion in the
mantle, it does not produce an appreciable magnetic field: The
silicon-rich rocks that comprise the mantle are poor conductors

Studies of ancient rocks reinforce the idea that our
planet’s magnetism is due to fluid material in motion. When iron-bearing lava cools and solidifies to
form igneous rock, it becomes magnetized in the direction of the
Earth’s magnetic field. By analyzing samples of igneous rock of
different ages from around the world, geologists have found that
the Earth’s magnetic field actually flips over and reverses direction on an irregular schedule ranging from tens of thousands to
hundreds of thousands of years. As an example, lava that solidified 30,000 years ago is magnetized in the opposite direction to
lava that has solidified recently. Therefore, 30,000 years ago a
compass needle would have pointed south, not north! If the
Earth was a permanent magnet, like the small magnets used to
attach notes to refrigerators, it would be hard to imagine how
its magnetic field could spontaneously reverse direction. But
computer simulations show that fields produced by moving fluids in the Earth’s outer core can indeed change direction from
time to time.

Plate tectonic theory offers insight into geology on the largest of
scales, that of an entire supercontinent. In recent years, geologists
have uncovered evidence that points to a whole succession of supercontinents that once broke apart and then reassembled. Pangaea is only the most recent supercontinent in this cycle, which
repeats about every 500 million (5 ⫻ 108) years. As a result, intense episodes of mountain building have occurred at roughly
500-million-year intervals.
Apparently, a supercontinent sows the seeds of its own destruction because it blocks the flow of heat from the Earth’s interior. As soon as a supercontinent forms, temperatures beneath
it rise, much as they do under a book lying on an electric blanket. As heat accumulates, the lithosphere domes upward and
cracks. Molten rock from the overheated asthenosphere wells up
to fill the resulting fractures, which continue to widen as pieces
of the fragmenting supercontinent move apart.
It can take a very long time for the heat trapped under a
supercontinent to escape. Although Pangaea broke apart some
200 million years ago (see Figure 9-11), the mantle under its
former location is still hot and is still trying to rise upward. As
a result, Africa—which lies close to the center of this mass of
rising material—sits several tens of meters higher than the other
continents.
The changes wrought by plate tectonics are very slow on the
scale of a human lifetime, but they are very rapid in comparison
with the age of the Earth. For example, the period over which
Pangaea broke into Laurasia and Gondwana was only about
0.4% of the Earth’s age of 4.56 ⫻ 109 years. (To put this in perspective, 0.4% of a human lifetime is about 4 months.) The lesson of plate tectonics is that the seemingly permanent face of the
Earth is in fact dynamic and ever-changing.

those in the outer core.)

The Magnetosphere
The Earth’s magnetic field has important effects far above the
atmosphere, where it interacts dramatically with charged particles
from the Sun. This solar wind is a flow of mostly protons and
electrons that streams constantly outward from the Sun’s upper
atmosphere. Near the Earth, the particles in the solar wind move
at speeds of roughly 450 km/s, or about a million miles per hour.
Because this is considerably faster than sound waves can travel in
the very thin gas between the planets, the solar wind is said to be
supersonic. (Because the gas between the planets is so thin, interplanetary sound waves carry too little energy to be heard by
astronauts.)
If the Earth had no magnetic field, we would be continually
bombarded by the solar wind. But our planet does have a magnetic field, and the forces that this field can exert on charged particles are strong enough to deflect them away from us. The region
of space around a planet in which the motion of charged particles is dominated by the planet’s magnetic field is called the
planet’s magnetosphere. Figure 9-20 is a scale drawing of the
Earth’s magnetosphere, which was discovered in the late 1950s
by the first satellites placed in orbit.
When the supersonic particles in the solar wind first encounter the Earth’s magnetic field, they abruptly slow to subsonic
speeds. The boundary where this sudden decrease in velocity occurs is called a shock wave. Still closer to the Earth lies another
boundary, called the magnetopause, where the outward magnetic
pressure of the Earth’s field is exactly counterbalanced by the impinging pressure of the solar wind. Most of the particles of the
solar wind are deflected around the magnetopause, just as water
is deflected to either side of the bow of a ship.
Some charged particles of the solar wind manage to leak
through the magnetopause. When they do, they are trapped by the
Earth’s magnetic field in two huge, doughnut-shaped rings around
Earth called the Van Allen belts. These belts were discovered in
1958 during the flight of the first successful U.S. Earth-orbiting
satellite. They are named after the physicist James Van Allen, who

then emit visible light as they drop down to their ground states,

of about 2000 to 5000 km, contains mostly protons. The outer

9-21c show the aurorae as seen from orbit and from the Earth’s
surface.
Occasionally, a violent event on the Sun’s surface sends a
particularly intense burst of protons and electrons toward Earth.
The resulting auroral display can be exceptionally bright and can
often be seen over a wide range of latitudes. Such events also disturb radio transmissions and can damage communication satellites and transmission lines.
It is remarkable that the Earth’s magnetosphere, including its
vast belts of charged particles, was entirely unknown until a few
decades ago. Such discoveries remind us of how little we truly understand and how much remains to be learned even about our
own planet.

9-5 The Earth’s atmosphere has changed
substantially over our planet’s history
Both plate tectonics and the Earth’s magnetic field paint a picture
of a planet with a dynamic, evolving surface and interior. Our
atmosphere, too, has changed and evolved substantially over the
Earth’s 4.56-billion-year history. As
The composition of our

solar system.

Earth’s Early Atmosphere
When the Earth first formed by accretion of planetesimals (see
Section 8-4), gases were probably trapped within the Earth’s interior in the same proportions that they were present in the solar
nebula. But since the early Earth was hot enough to be molten
throughout its volume, most of these trapped gases were released.
As we discussed in Section 7-4 and Box 7-2, the Earth’s gravity was
too weak to prevent hydrogen and helium—the two most common kinds of atoms in the universe, but also the least massive—
from leaking away into space. The atmosphere that remained still
contained substantial amounts of hydrogen, but in the form of
relatively massive molecules of water vapor (H2O) made by combining two atoms of hydrogen with one atom of oxygen, the third
most common element in our part of the Milky Way Galaxy (see
Figure 8-4). In fact, water vapor was probably the dominant constituent of the early atmosphere, which is thought to have been
about 100 times denser than our present-day atmosphere.
Water vapor is one of the greenhouse gases that we discussed
in Section 9-1. It traps infrared radiation from the Earth’s surface,
and its presence in the early atmosphere helped to sustain the high
temperature of the surface. But if water vapor had been the only
constituent of the atmosphere, you would not be reading these
words! The reason is that as the molten Earth inevitably cooled,
water vapor in the atmosphere condensed into raindrops and fell
to Earth to form the oceans. As water vapor was lost from the
atmosphere, its contribution to the greenhouse effect weakened,
which would have made the surface temperature drop even lower.
A further cooling factor is that the young Sun was only about
70% as bright as it is today. The net result is that the entire Earth
should have been frozen over! Ice is so reflective that the Earth
would have remained frozen even as the Sun aged and became
more luminous. Liquid water is absolutely essential to all living
creatures, so life as we know it would probably never have evolved
on such an icy Earth.
In fact, the first living organisms appeared on Earth within
400 million years after the planet first formed. Hence, the Earth
could not have been frozen over for very long, if at all. What
saved our planet from a perpetual deep freeze was the presence
of carbon, the fourth most common of the elements. When combined with oxygen, carbon forms carbon dioxide (CO2), a greenhouse gas that remains gaseous at low temperatures. Carbon
dioxide would have been released into the atmosphere by volcanic
activity, a process called outgassing (see Figure 9-15). It would
also have been added to the atmosphere by carbon-rich meteors
striking the planet’s surface. Once CO2 was in the atmosphere, its

223

greenhouse effect raised the planet’s temperature and melted the
ice. Some of the water evaporated into the atmosphere, further
enhancing the Earth’s greenhouse effect.
Fewer than one in 2500 of the molecules in today’s atmosphere is carbon dioxide. But CO2 must have been thousands of
times more abundant in the early Earth’s atmosphere in order to
melt the global ice sheath. Unlike hydrogen or helium, this excess
CO2 was not lost into space; instead, it has been trapped in rocks.
Carbon dioxide dissolves in rainwater and falls into the oceans,
where it combines with other substances to form a class of minerals called carbonates. (Limestone and marble are examples of
carbonate-bearing rock.) These form sediments on the ocean floor,
which are eventually recycled into the crust by subduction. As an
example, marble (Figure 9-19c) is a metamorphic rock formed
deep within the crust from limestone, a carbonate-rich sedimentary rock.
This process removed most of the CO2 from the atmosphere
within the first billion (109) years after the formation of the Earth.
Although this weakened the greenhouse effect, temperatures remained warm as the Sun’s brightness increased. The small amounts
of atmospheric CO2 that remain today are the result of a balance
between volcanic activity (which releases CO2 into the atmosphere) and the formation of carbonates (which removes CO2).
(As we will see in Section 9-7, human activity is upsetting this
balance.)

Life’s Impact on Earth’s Atmosphere
The appearance of life on Earth set into motion a radical transformation of the atmosphere. Early single-cell organisms converted energy from sunlight into chemical energy using
photosynthesis, a chemical process that consumes CO2 and water
and releases oxygen (O2). Oxygen molecules are very reactive, so
originally most of the O2 produced by photosynthesis combined
with other substances to form minerals called oxides. (Evidence
for this can be found in rock formations of various ages. The oldest rocks have very low oxide content, while oxides are prevalent
in rocks that formed after the appearance of organisms that used
photosynthesis.) But as life proliferated, the amount of photosynthesis increased dramatically. Eventually so much oxygen was being produced that it could not all be absorbed to form oxides, and
O2 began to accumulate in the atmosphere. Figure 9-22 shows
how the amount of O2 in the atmosphere has increased over the
history of the Earth.
About 2 billion (2 ⫻ 109) years ago, a new type of life evolved
to take advantage of the newly abundant oxygen. These new organisms produce energy by consuming oxygen and releasing carbon dioxide—a process called respiration that is used by all
modern animals, including humans. Such organisms thrived because photosynthetic plants continued to add even more oxygen
to the atmosphere.
Several hundred million years ago, the number of oxygen
molecules in the atmosphere stabilized at 21% of the total, the
same as the present-day value. This value represents a balance
between the release of oxygen from plants by photosynthesis
and the intake of oxygen by respiration. Thus, the abundance
of oxygen is regulated almost exclusively by the presence of
life—a situation that has no parallel anywhere else in the solar
system.

The Increase in Atmospheric Oxygen This graph shows how the

present-day value) has evolved with time. Note that the atmosphere
contained essentially no oxygen until about 2 billion years ago. (Adapted
from Preston Cloud, “The Biosphere,” Scientific American, September 1983,
p. 176)

The most numerous molecules in our atmosphere are nitrogen (N2), which make up 78% of the total. These, too, are a consequence of the presence of life on Earth. Certain bacteria extract
oxygen from minerals called nitrates, and in the process liberate
nitrogen into the atmosphere. The amount of atmospheric nitrogen is kept in check by lightning. The energy in a lightning flash
causes atmospheric nitrogen and oxygen to combine into nitrogen
oxides, which dissolve in rainwater, fall into the oceans, and form
nitrates.

is less than 1/10,000 as dense. On neither Venus nor Mars was
life able to blossom and transform the atmosphere as it did here
on Earth.
We have thus uncovered a general rule about the terrestrial
planets:
The closer a terrestrial planet is to the Sun, the more important
the greenhouse effect in that planet’s atmosphere. The stronger
the greenhouse effect, the higher the planet’s surface
temperature.
This rule suggests that if the Earth had formed a bit closer to or
farther from the Sun, temperatures on our planet might have been
too high or too low for life ever to evolve. Thus, our very existence
is a result of the Earth’s special position in the solar system.

a layered structure

structure of the atmosphere is controlled by the influence of sunlight. Circulation in our

Atmospheric pressure at any height in the atmosphere
is caused by the weight of all the air above that height.
The average atmospheric pressure at sea level is defined to be one atmosphere (1 atm), equal to 1.01 ⫻ 105 N/m2 or
14.7 pounds per square inch. As you go up in the atmosphere,
there is less air above you to weigh down on you. Hence, atmospheric pressure decreases smoothly with increasing altitude.
Unlike atmospheric pressure, temperature varies with altitude
in a complex way. Figure 9-23 shows that temperature decreases
with increasing altitude in some layers of the atmosphere, but in
other layers actually increases with increasing altitude. These differences result from the individual ways in which each layer is heated.
9.1
ER

Table 9-4 shows the dramatic differences between
the Earth’s atmosphere and those of Venus and Mars.
(Mercury, the other terrestrial planet, is too small
and has too little gravity to hold an appreciable atmosphere.)
The greater intensity of sunlight on Venus caused higher temperatures, which boiled any liquid water and made it impossible for CO2 to be taken out of the atmosphere and put back
into rocks. The atmosphere thus became far denser than our
own and rich in greenhouse gases. The result was a very strong
greenhouse effect that raised temperatures on Venus to their
present value of about 460°C (733 K ⫽ 855°F).
Just the opposite happened on Mars, where sunlight is less
than half as intense as on Earth. The lower temperatures drove
CO2 from the atmosphere into Martian rocks, and froze all of

The lowest layer, called the troposphere, extends from
the surface to an average altitude of 12 km (roughly
7.5 miles, or 39,000 ft). It is heated only indirectly by
the Sun. Sunlight warms the Earth’s surface, which heats the
lower part of the troposphere. By contrast, the upper part of the
troposphere remains at cooler temperatures. This vertical temperature variation causes convection currents that move up and down

225

through the troposphere (see Section 8-1). All of the Earth’s
weather is a consequence of this convection.
Convection on a grand scale is caused by the temperature difference between the Earth’s equator and its poles. If the Earth did
not rotate, heated air near the equator would rise upward and flow
at high altitude toward the poles. There it would cool and sink to
lower altitudes, at which it would flow back to the equator. However, the Earth’s rotation breaks up this simple convection pattern
into a series of convection cells. In these cells, air flows east and
west as well as vertically and in a north-south direction. The structure of these cells explains why the prevailing winds blow in different directions at different latitudes (Figure 9-24).

Upper Layers of the Atmosphere
Almost all the oxygen in the troposphere is in the form of O2, a
molecule made of two oxygen atoms. But in the stratosphere,
which extends from about 12 to 50 km (about 7.5 to 31 mi)
above the surface, an appreciable amount of oxygen is in the form
of ozone, a molecule made of three oxygen atoms (O3). Unlike
O2, ozone is very efficient at absorbing ultraviolet radiation from
the Sun, which means that the stratosphere can directly absorb
solar energy. The result is that the temperature actually increases
as you move upward in the stratosphere. Convection requires that
the temperature must decrease, not increase, with increasing
altitude, so there are essentially no convection currents in the
stratosphere.
Above the stratosphere lies the mesosphere. Very little ozone
is found here, so solar ultraviolet radiation is not absorbed within
the mesosphere, and atmospheric temperature again declines with
increasing altitude.

Circulation Patterns in the Earth’s Atmosphere The dominant

In the northern temperate region (including the continental United

toward the northeast. Farther south, within the northern tropical
region (for example, Hawaii), the prevailing surface winds are from
northeast to southwest.

The temperature of the mesosphere reaches a minimum of about ⫺75°C (⫽ ⫺103°F ⫽ 198 K) at an altitude of about 80 km (50 mi). This minimum marks the
bottom of the atmosphere’s thinnest and uppermost layer, the
thermosphere, in which temperature once again rises with increasing altitude. This is not due to the presence of ozone, because in
this very low-density region oxygen and nitrogen are found as
individual atoms rather than in molecules. Instead, the thermosphere is heated because these isolated atoms absorb very-shortwavelength solar ultraviolet radiation (which oxygen and nitrogen
molecules cannot absorb).

CAUTION! At altitudes near 300 km the temperature of the
thermosphere is about 1000°C (1800°F). This is near the altitude at which the space shuttle and satellites orbit the Earth.
Nonetheless, a satellite in orbit does not risk being burned up as
it moves through the thermosphere. The reason is that the thermosphere is far less dense than the atmosphere at sea level. The
high temperature simply means that an average atom in the thermosphere is moving very fast (see Box 7-2). But because the
thermosphere is so thin (only about 10⫺11 as dense as the air at
sea level), these fast-moving atoms are few and far between.
Hence, the thermosphere contains very little energy. Nearly all
the heat that an orbiting satellite receives is from sunlight, not
the thermosphere.

profoundly altering the Earth’s biosphere
One of the extraordinary characteristics of the Earth is that it

mountains and from frigid polar caps to blistering deserts. So
far in this chapter we have hinted at how our planet and living
organisms interact: the greenhouse

years that evolution has trans- civilization

of the atmosphere (Section 9-5). Let’s explore in greater depth
how Earth and the organisms that live on it, especially humans,
affect each other.

The Biosphere and Natural Climate Variation
All life on Earth subsists in a relatively thin layer called the biosphere, which includes the oceans, the lowest few kilometers of
the troposphere, and the crust to a depth of almost 3 kilometers.
Figure 9-25 is a portrait of the Earth’s biosphere based on NASA
satellite data. The biosphere, which has taken billions of years to
evolve to its present state, is a delicate, highly complex system in
which plants and animals depend on each other for their mutual
survival.

The state of the biosphere depends crucially on the temperature of the oceans and atmosphere. Even small temperature changes can have dramatic consequences. An
example that recurs every three to seven years is the El Niño phenomenon, in which temperatures at the surface of the equatorial
Pacific Ocean rise by 2 to 3°C. Ordinarily, water from the cold
depths of the ocean is able to well upward, bringing with it nutrients that are used by microscopic marine organisms called phytoplankton that live near the surface (see Figure 9-25). But during an
El Niño, the warm surface water suppresses this upwelling, and the
phytoplankton starve. This wreaks havoc on organisms such as
mollusks that feed on phytoplankton, on the fish that feed on the
mollusks, and on the birds and mammals that eat the fish. During
the 1982–1983 El Niño, a quarter of the adult sea lions off the Peruvian coast starved, along with all of their pups.
Many different factors can change the surface temperature of
our planet. One is that the amount of energy radiated by the Sun
can vary up or down by a few tenths of a percent. Reduced solar
brightness may explain the period from 1450 to 1850 when European winters were substantially colder than they are today.
Other factors are the gravitational influences of the Moon
and the other planets. Thanks to these influences, the eccentricity
of the Earth’s orbit varies with a period of 90,000 to 100,000
years, the tilt of its rotation axis varies between 22.1° and 24.5°
with a 40,000-year period, and the orientation of its rotation axis
changes due to precession (see Section 2-6) with a 26,000-year period. These variations can affect climate by altering the amount
of solar energy that heats the Earth during different parts of the
year. They help explain why the Earth periodically undergoes an
extended period of low temperatures called an ice age, the last of
which ended about 11,000 years ago.
As we saw in Sections 9-1 and 9-5, one of the most important factors affecting global temperatures is the abundance of
greenhouse gases such as CO2. Geologic processes can alter this
abundance, either by removing CO2 from the atmosphere (as
happens when fresh rock is uplifted and exposed to the air,
where it can absorb atmospheric CO2 to form carbonates) or
by supplying new CO2 (as in volcanic eruptions like that shown
in Figure 9-15). From time to time in our planet’s history, natural events have caused dramatic increases in the amount of
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. One such event may have
taken place 251 million (2.51 ⫻ 108) years ago, when Siberia
went through a period of intense volcanic activity. (The evidence for this is a layer of igneous rock in Siberia that covers
an area about the size of Europe. Like the rock shown in Figure 9-19a, this layer—which radioactive dating reveals to be
2.51 ⫻ 10 8 years old—is solidified lava.) The tremendous
amounts of CO2 released by this activity would have elevated
the global temperature by several degrees. Remarkably, the fossil record reveals that 95% of all species on Earth became extinct at this same time. The coincidence of these two events
suggests that greenhouse-induced warming can have catastrophic effects on life.

The Human Population Data and estimates from the U.S. Bureau of the
Census, the Population Reference Bureau, and the United Nations

in the eighteenth century and has been increasing at an astonishing rate
since 1900.

the Industrial Revolution and the spread of modern ideas about
hygiene. This rise accelerated in the twentieth century thanks to
medical and technological advances ranging from antibiotics to
high-yield grains. In 1960 there were 3 billion people on Earth;
in 1975, 4 billion; and in 1999, 6 billion. Projections by the
United Nations Population Division show that there will be more
than 8 billion people on Earth by the year 2030 and more than
9 billion by 2050.
Every human being has basic requirements: food, clothing, and
housing. We all need fuel for cooking and heating. To meet these
demands, we cut down forests, cultivate grasslands, and build
sprawling cities. A striking example of this activity is occurring in
the Amazon rain forest of Brazil. Tropical rain forests are vital to
our planet’s ecology because they absorb significant amounts of
CO2 and release O2 through photosynthesis. Although rain forests
occupy only 7% of the world’s land areas, they are home to at least
50% of all plant and animal species on Earth. Nevertheless, to
make way for farms and grazing land, people simply cut down the
trees and set them on fire—a process called slash-and-burn. Such
deforestation, along with extensive lumbering operations, is occurring in Malaysia, Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea. The rain
forests that once thrived in Central America, India, and the western coast of Africa are almost gone (Figure 9-27).

Human Effects on the Biosphere: The Ozone Layer
Human activity is also having potentially disastrous effects on the
upper atmosphere. Certain chemicals released into the air—in
particular chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which have been used in
refrigeration and electronics, and methyl bromide, which is
used in fumigation—are destroying the ozone in the stratosphere.
We saw in Section 9-6 that ozone molecules absorb ultraviolet

radiation from the Sun. Without this high-altitude ozone layer,
solar ultraviolet radiation would beat down on the Earth’s surface with greatly increased intensity. Such radiation breaks apart
most of the delicate molecules that form living tissue. Hence, a
complete loss of the ozone layer would lead to a catastrophic ecological disaster.
In 1985 scientists discovered an ozone hole, a region with an
abnormally low concentration of ozone, over Antarctica. Since
then this hole has generally expanded from one year to the next
(Figure 9-28). Smaller but still serious effects have been observed
in the stratosphere above other parts of the Earth. As a result,
there has been a worldwide increase in the number of deaths due
to skin cancer caused by solar ultraviolet radiation. By international agreement, CFCs are being replaced by compounds that do
not deplete stratospheric ozone, and sunlight naturally produces

more ozone in the stratosphere. But even in the best of circumstances, the damage to the ozone layer is not expected to heal for
many decades.

Human Effects on the Biosphere: Global Warming and
Climate Change
The most troubling influence of human affairs on the biosphere
is a consequence of burning fossil fuels (petroleum and coal) in
automobiles, airplanes, and power plants as well as burning forests
and brushland for agriculture and cooking (Figure 9-27). This
burning releases carbon dioxide into the Earth’s atmosphere—
and we are adding CO2 to the atmosphere faster than plants and
geological processes can extract it. Figure 9-29 shows how the

are far more effective greenhouse gases than CO2.
The effects of global warming can be seen around the world.
Nine of the 10 warmest years on record have occurred since
1995, and the years since 2000 have seen increasing numbers of
droughts, water shortages, and unprecedented heat waves. Glaciers worldwide are receding, the size of the ice cap around the
North Pole has decreased by 20% since 1979, and a portion of
the Antarctic ice shelf has broken off (Figure 9-31).

carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere has increased since
1958, when scientists began to measure this quantity on an ongoing basis.
To put the values shown in Figure 9-29 into perspective, we
need to know the atmospheric CO2 concentration in earlier eras.
Scientists have learned this by analyzing air bubbles trapped at
various depths in the ice that blankets the Antarctic and Greenland. Each winter a new ice layer is deposited, so the depth of a
bubble indicates the year in which it was trapped. Figure 9-30
uses data obtained in this way to show how the atmospheric CO2
concentration has varied since 1000 A.D. While there has been
some natural variation in the concentration, its value has skyrocketed since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution around 1800.
Data from older, deeper bubbles of trapped air show that in the
650,000 years before the Industrial Revolution, the CO2 concentration was never greater than 300 parts per million. The presentday CO2 concentration is greater than this by 25%, and has
grown to its present elevated level in just over half a century. If
there are no changes in our energy consumption habits, by 2050
the atmospheric CO2 concentration will be greater than 600 parts
per million.
Increasing atmospheric CO2 is of concern because this
strengthens the greenhouse effect and raises the Earth’s average
surface temperature. Figure 9-30 also shows how this average
temperature has varied since 1000 A.D. (Like the CO2 data, the
temperature data from past centuries comes from analyzing
trapped air bubbles. Scientists measure the relative amounts of
two different types of atmospheric oxygen called 16O and 18O,
described in Box 5-5, in a bubble. The ratio of these is a sensitive
measure of the temperature at that time the air was trapped inside the ice.) The recent dramatic increase in atmospheric CO2
concentration has produced an equally dramatic increase in the
average surface temperature. This temperature increase is called
global warming. Other explanations for global warming have
been proposed, such as changes in the Sun’s brightness, but only
greenhouse gases produced by human activity can explain the

Figure 9-31

A Melting Antarctic Ice Shelf Global warming caused the
Larsen B ice shelf to break up in early 2002. This ice shelf,
which was about the size of Rhode Island, is thought to have been part of
the Antarctic coast for the past 12,000 years. (NASA/GSFC/LaRC/JPL, MIST
Team)

The Living Earth

Unfortunately, global warming is predicted to intensify in the
decades to come. The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change predicts that if nothing is done to decrease the rate at
which we add greenhouse gases to our atmosphere, the average
surface temperature will continue to rise by an additional 1.4 to
5.8°C during the twenty-first century. What is worse, the temperature increase is predicted to be greater at the poles than at the
equator. The global pattern of atmospheric circulation (Figure
9-24) depends on the temperature difference between the warm
equator and cold poles, so this entire pattern will be affected. The
same is true for the circulation patterns in the oceans. As a result,
temperatures will rise in some regions and decline in others and
the patterns of rainfall will be substantially altered. Agriculture
depends on rainfall, so these changes in rainfall patterns can cause
major disruptions in the world food supply. Studies suggest that
the climate changes caused by a 3°C increase in the average surface temperature would cause a worldwide drop in cereal crops
of 20 to 400 million tons, putting 400 million more people at risk
of hunger.
The melting of polar ice due to global warming poses an additional risk to our civilization. When floating ice like that found
near the North Pole melts, the ocean level remains the same. (You
can see this by examining a glass of water with an ice cube floating in it. The water level doesn’t change when the ice melts.) But
the ocean level rises when ice on land melts and runs off into the
sea. The Greenland ice cap has been melting at an accelerating
rate since 2000 and has the potential to raise sea levels by half a
meter or more. Low-lying coastal communities such as Boston
and New Orleans, as well as river cities such as London, will have
a greater risk of catastrophic flooding. Some island nations of the
Pacific will disappear completely beneath the waves.
While global warming is an unintended consequence of human activity, the solution to global warming will require concerted and thoughtful action. Global warming cannot be stopped
completely: Even if we were to immediately halt all production of
greenhouse gases, the average surface temperature would increase
an additional 2°C by 2100 thanks to the natural inertia of the
Earth’s climate system. Instead, our goal is to minimize the effects
of global warming by changing the ways in which we produce energy, making choices about how to decrease our requirements for
energy, and finding ways to remove CO2 from the atmosphere
and trap it in the oceans or beneath our planet’s surface. Confronting global warming is perhaps the greatest challenge to face
our civilization in the twenty-first century.

Key Ideas
The Earth’s Energy Sources: All activity in the Earth’s atmosphere, oceans, and surface is powered by three sources of energy.
• Solar energy is the energy source for the atmosphere. In the
greenhouse effect, some of this energy is trapped by infraredabsorbing gases in the atmosphere, raising the Earth’s surface
temperature.
• Tidal forces from the Moon and Sun help to power the motion
of the oceans.
• The internal heat of the Earth is the energy source for geologic
activity.
The Earth’s Interior: Studies of seismic waves (vibrations produced by earthquakes) show that the Earth has a small, solid inner core surrounded by a liquid outer core. The outer core is
surrounded by the dense mantle, which in turn is surrounded by
the thin low-density crust.
• Seismologists deduce the Earth’s interior structure by studying
how longitudinal P waves and transverse S waves travel through
the Earth’s interior.
• The Earth’s inner and outer cores are composed of almost pure
iron with some nickel mixed in. The mantle is composed of ironrich minerals.
• Both temperature and pressure steadily increase with depth inside the Earth.

Plate Tectonics: The Earth’s crust and a small part of its upper
mantle form a rigid layer called the lithosphere. The lithosphere
is divided into huge plates that move about over the plastic layer
called the asthenosphere in the upper mantle.
• Plate tectonics, or movement of the plates, is driven by convection within the asthenosphere. Molten material wells up at oceanic
rifts, producing seafloor spreading, and is returned to the asthenosphere in subduction zones. As one end of a plate is subducted
back into the asthenosphere, it helps to pull the rest of the plate
along.

Chapter 9

• Plate tectonics is responsible for most of the major features of
the Earth’s surface, including mountain ranges, volcanoes, and
the shapes of the continents and oceans.
• Plate tectonics is involved in the formation of the three major
categories of rocks: igneous rocks (cooled from molten material),
sedimentary rocks (formed by the action of wind, water, and ice),
and metamorphic rocks (altered in the solid state by extreme heat
and pressure).
The Earth’s Magnetic Field and Magnetosphere: Electric currents
in the liquid outer core generate a magnetic field. This magnetic
field produces a magnetosphere that surrounds the Earth and
blocks the solar wind from hitting the atmosphere.
• A bow-shaped shock wave, where the supersonic solar wind is
abruptly slowed to subsonic speeds, marks the outer boundary of
the magnetosphere.
• Most of the particles of the solar wind are deflected around the
Earth by the magnetosphere.

• Some charged particles from the solar wind are trapped in two
huge, doughnut-shaped rings called the Van Allen belts. An excess of these particles can initiate an auroral display.
The Earth’s Atmosphere: The Earth’s atmosphere differs from
those of the other terrestrial planets in its chemical composition,
circulation pattern, and temperature profile.
• The Earth’s atmosphere evolved from being mostly water vapor
to being rich in carbon dioxide. A strong greenhouse effect kept
the Earth warm enough for water to remain liquid and to permit
the evolution of life.
• The appearance of photosynthetic living organisms led to our
present atmospheric composition, about four-fifths nitrogen and
one-fifth oxygen.
• The Earth’s atmosphere is divided into layers called the troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere. Ozone molecules in the stratosphere absorb ultraviolet light.
• Because of the Earth’s rapid rotation, the circulation in its atmosphere is complex, with three circulation cells in each hemisphere.
The Biosphere: Human activity is changing the Earth’s biosphere,
on which all living organisms depend.
• Industrial chemicals released into the atmosphere have damaged
the ozone layer in the stratosphere.
• Deforestation and the burning of fossil fuels are increasing the
greenhouse effect in our atmosphere and warming the planet.
This can lead to destructive changes in the climate.

Moon, the center of mass is close to the Earth’s center: Indeed, it
actually lies within the Earth’s interior.) The center of mass then
follows an elliptical orbit around the Sun (Figure 10-2a). In a similar way, a spinning wrench sliding along a table actually rotates
around its center of mass (Figure 10-2b).

odic wobbling, called libration, permits us to view 59% of our

Even without binoculars or a telescope, you can easily see that
dark gray and light gray areas cover vast expanses of the Moon’s
rocky surface. If you observe the Moon over many nights, you
will see the Moon go through its phases as the dividing line between the illuminated and darkened portion of the Moon (the terminator) shifts. But you will always see the same pattern of dark
and light areas, because the Moon keeps the same side turned toward the Earth; you never see the far side (or back side) of the
Moon. We saw in Section 3-2 that this is the result of the Moon’s
synchronous rotation: It takes precisely the same amount of time
for the Moon to rotate on its axis (one lunar “day”) as it does to
complete one orbit around the Earth.

We stress that the Moon only appears to be wobbling.
In fact, its rotation axis keeps nearly the same orientation in space as the Moon goes around its orbit. The
reason why the Moon seems to rock back and forth is that its orbit around the Earth is slightly elliptical. As a result, the Moon’s
orbital motion does not keep pace with its rotation at all points
around the orbit. Furthermore, because the Moon’s rotation axis
is not exactly perpendicular to the plane of its orbit, it appears to
us to nod up and down.

An Airless World
Clouds always cover some portion of the Earth’s surface, but
clouds are never seen on the Moon (see Figure 10-1). This is because the Moon is too small a world to have an atmosphere. Its
surface gravity is low, only about one-sixth as great as that of the
Earth, and thus any gas molecules can easily escape into space
(see Box 7-2). Because there is no atmosphere to scatter sunlight,
the daytime sky on the Moon appears as black as the nighttime
sky on the Earth (see the photograph that opens this chapter).
The absence of an atmosphere means that the Moon can have
no liquid water on its surface. Here on Earth, water molecules are
kept in the liquid state by the pressure of the atmosphere pushing down on them. To see what happens to liquid water on the

conditions, water can exist as a solid (ice) or a vapor but not as

CAUTION! If astronauts were to venture out onto the lunar
surface without wearing spacesuits, the lack of atmosphere
would not cause their blood to boil. That’s because our skin is
strong enough to contain bodily fluids. In the same way, if we
place an orange in a sealed container and remove all the air, the
orange retains all of its fluid and does not explode. It even tastes
the same afterward! The reasons why astronauts wore pressurized spacesuits on the Moon (see the photograph that opens this
chapter) were to provide oxygen for breathing, to regulate body
temperature, and to protect against ultraviolet radiation from
the Sun. Since the Moon has no atmosphere, and thus no ozone
layer like that of the Earth to screen out ultraviolet wavelengths
(Section 9-7), an unprotected astronaut would suffer a sunburn
after just 10 seconds of exposure!

Lunar Craters
Since the Moon has no atmosphere to obscure its surface, you can
get a clear view of several different types of lunar features with a
small telescope or binoculars. These include craters, the darkcolored maria, and the light-colored lunar highlands or terrae
(Figure 10-3). Taken together, these different features show the
striking differences between the surfaces of the Earth and the
Moon.
With an Earth-based telescope, some 30,000 craters are visible, with diameters ranging from 1 km to several hundred km.

The Crater Clavius This photograph from the 5-meter (200-in.) Palomar

craters too small to be seen from Earth. Following a tradition established in the seventeenth century, the most prominent craters
are named after famous philosophers, mathematicians, and scientists, such as Plato, Aristotle, Pythagoras, Copernicus, and Kepler.
Virtually all lunar craters, both large and small, are the result of
the Moon’s having been bombarded by meteoritic material. For
this reason, they are also called impact craters (see Section 7-6).
One piece of evidence that lunar craters are caused by impacts is
that many large craters have a central peak, with a shape that
could only result from high-speed impacts (see Figure 7-10a).

A meteoroid striking the lunar surface generates a
shock wave over the surface outward from the point
of impact. Such shock waves can spread over an area
much larger than the size of the meteoroid that generated the
wave. Very large craters more than 100 km across, such as the
crater Clavius shown in Figure 10-4, were probably created by
the impact of a fast-moving piece of rock only a few kilometers
in radius.

Maria: Dark and Relatively Young
The large dark areas on the lunar surface shown in Figure 10-3
are called maria (pronounced “MAR-ee-uh”). They form a pattern that looks crudely like a human face, sometimes called “the
man in the Moon.” The singular form of maria is mare (pronounced “MAR-ay”), which means “sea” in Latin. These terms
date from the seventeenth century, when observers using early telescopes thought these dark features were large bodies of water.

Our Barren Moon

They gave the maria fanciful and romantic names such as Mare
Tranquillitatis (Sea of Tranquillity), Mare Nubium (Sea of
Clouds), Mare Nectaris (Sea of Nectar), Mare Serenitatis (Sea of
Serenity), and Mare Imbrium (Sea of Showers). While modern astronomers still use these names, they now understand that the
maria are not bodies of water (which, as we have seen, could not
exist on the airless Moon) but rather the remains of huge lava
flows. The maria get their distinctive appearance from the dark
color of the solidified lava.
On the whole, the maria have far fewer craters than the surrounding terrain. Since craters are caused by meteoritic bombardment, this means that the maria have not been exposed to that
bombardment for as long as the surrounding terrain. Hence, the
maria must be relatively young, and the lava flows that formed
them must have occurred at a later stage in the Moon’s geologic
history (Figure 10-5). The craters that are found in the maria
were caused by the relatively few impacts that have occurred since
the maria solidified (Figure 10-6).
Although they are much larger than craters, maria also tend
to be circular in shape (see Figure 10-5). This suggests that, like
craters, these depressions in the lunar surface were also created
by impacts. It is thought that very large meteoroids or asteroids
some tens of kilometers across struck the Moon, forming basins.
These depressions subsequently flooded with lava that flowed out
from the Moon’s interior through cracks in the lunar crust. The

Connections figure depicts our understanding of how lunar craters
and maria formed.
An impact large enough to create a mare basin must have
thrust upward tremendous amounts of material around the impact site. This explains the mountain ranges that curve in circular arcs around mare basins. Analysis of lunar rocks as well as
observations made from lunar orbit have validated this picture of
the origin of lunar mountains.

Mare Imbrium from Earth Mare Imbrium is the largest of 14 dark plains
that dominate the Earth-facing side of the Moon. Its diameter of 1100 km
(700 mi) is about the same as the distance from Chicago to Philadelphia
or from London to Rome. The maria formed after the surrounding
light-colored terrain, so they have not been exposed to meteoritic
bombardment for as long and hence have fewer craters. (Carnegie

WE

Surrounding light-colored terrain:
more craters, so relatively old

The light-colored terrain that surrounds the maria is called terrae,
from the Latin for “lands.” (Seventeenth-century astronomers
thought that this terrain was the dry land that surrounded lunar
oceans.) Detailed measurements by astronauts in lunar orbit
demonstrated that the maria on the Moon’s Earth-facing side are
2 to 5 km below the average lunar elevation, while the terrae extend to several kilometers above the average elevation. For this
reason terrae are often called lunar highlands. The flat, low-lying,
dark gray maria cover only 15% of the lunar surface; the remaining 85% is light gray lunar highlands. Since the lunar highlands
are more heavily cratered than the maria, we can conclude that
the highlands are older.
Remarkably, when the Moon’s far side was photographed for the first time by the Soviet Luna 3 spacecraft in 1959, scientists were surprised to find almost

no maria there. Thus, lunar highlands predominate on the side
of the Moon that faces away from the Earth (Figure 10-7). Presumably, the crust is thicker on the far side, so even the most
massive impacts there were unable to crack through the crust and
let lava flood onto the surface. The Moon is not unique in having two hemispheres with different crustal thicknesses: The
Earth’s northern hemisphere has much more continental crust
than its southern hemisphere, and the southern hemisphere of
Mars has a thicker crust than the northern hemisphere.
Although the Moon’s far side is deficient in maria compared
to the near side, the highlands on the far side are as heavily pockmarked by impacts as those on the
near side. The most prominent fea- In contrast to the Earth

Moon’s surface—any mention of plate tectonics. Indeed, no evidence for plate tectonics can be found on the Moon. Recall

from Section 9-3 that the Earth’s major mountain ranges were
created by collisions between lithospheric plates. In contrast, it
appears that the Moon is a one-plate world: Its entire lithosphere is a single, solid plate. There are no rifts where plates
are moving apart, no mountain ranges of the sort formed by
collisions between plates, and no subduction zones. Thus, while
lunar mountain ranges bear the names of terrestrial ranges,
such as the Alps, Carpathians, and Apennines, they are entirely
different in character: they were formed by material ejected
from impact sites, not by plate tectonics. Geologically, the
Moon is a dead world.
In Section 7-6 we discussed the general rule that a world
with abundant craters has an old, geologically inactive surface.
The Moon is a prime example of this rule. Without an atmosphere to cause erosion and without plate tectonics, the surface of
the Moon changes only very slowly. That is why the Moon’s
craters, many of which are now known to be billions of years
old, remain visible today. On the Earth, by contrast, the continents and seafloor are continually being reshaped by seafloor
spreading, mountain building, and subduction. Thus, any craters
that were formed by impacts on the ancient Earth’s surface have
long since been erased. There are fewer than 200 impact craters
on the Earth today; these were formed within the last few hundred million years and have not yet been erased.

The First Spacecraft to the Moon
As in Verne’s story, politics had much to do with the motivation
for going to the Moon. But in fact, there were excellent scientific
reasons to do so. Because the Earth is a geologically active planet,
typical terrestrial surface rocks are only a few hundred million
years old, which is only a small fraction of the Earth’s age. Thus,
all traces of the Earth’s origins have been erased. By contrast,
rocks on the geologically inactive surface of the Moon have been
essentially undisturbed for billions of years. Samples of lunar
rocks have helped answer many questions about the Moon and
have shed light on the origin of the Earth and the birth of the entire solar system.

The first of six manned lunar landings took place on
July 20, 1969, when the Apollo 11 lunar module Eagle set down in Mare Tranquillitatis (see Figure 10-6).
Astronauts Neil Armstrong and Edwin “Buzz” Aldrin were the
first humans to set foot on the Moon. Apollo 12 also landed in a
mare, Oceanus Procellarum (Ocean of Storms). The Apollo 13
mission experienced a nearly catastrophic inflight explosion that
made it impossible for it to land on the Moon. Fortunately, titanic efforts by the astronauts and ground personnel brought it
safely home. The remaining four missions, Apollo 14 through
Apollo 17, were made in progressively more challenging terrain,
chosen to permit the exploration of a wide variety of geologically
interesting features. The first era of human exploration of the
Moon culminated in December 1972, when Apollo 17 landed in

Lunar missions began in 1959, when the Soviet Union sent three small spacecraft—Lunas
1, 2, and 3—toward the Moon. American attempts to reach the Moon began in the early 1960s with Project
Ranger. Equipped with six television cameras, the Ranger spacecraft transmitted close-up views of the lunar surface taken in the
final few minutes before they crashed onto the Moon. These
images showed far more detail than even the best Earth-based
telescope.
In 1966 and 1967, five Lunar Orbiter spacecraft were placed
in orbit around the Moon and made a high-resolution photographic survey of 99.5% of the lunar surface. Some of these photographs show features as small as 1 meter across and were
essential in helping NASA scientists choose suitable landing sites
for the astronauts.
Even after the Ranger missions, it was unclear whether the
lunar surface was a safe place to land. One leading theory was
that billions of years of impacts by meteoroids had ground the
Moon’s surface to a fine powder, much like that used by dental
hygienists to polish teeth. Perhaps a spacecraft attempting to land

For thousands of years, storytellers have invented fabulous tales of voyages to the Moon. The seventeenthcentury French satirist Cyrano de Bergerac wrote of a
spacecraft whose motive power was provided by spheres of morning dew. (After all, reasoned Cyrano, dew rises with the morning
sun, so a spacecraft would rise along with it.) In his imaginative
tale Somnium, Cyrano’s contemporary Johannes Kepler (the same
Kepler who deduced the laws of planetary motion) used the astronomical knowledge of his time to envision what it would be
like to walk on the Moon’s surface. In 1865 the French author
Jules Verne published From the Earth to the Moon, a story of a
spacecraft sent to the Moon from a launching site in Florida.
Almost exactly a hundred years later, Florida was indeed the
starting point of the first voyages
made by humans to other worlds. The Moon is the only

would simply sink into a quicksandlike sea of dust! Thus, before
a manned landing on the Moon could be attempted, it was necessary to try a soft landing of an unmanned spacecraft. This was
the purpose of the Surveyor program. Between June 1966 and
January 1968, five Surveyors successfully touched down on the
Moon, sending back pictures and data directly from the lunar surface. These missions demonstrated convincingly that the Moon’s
surface was as solid as that of the Earth. Figure 10-8 shows an
astronaut visiting Surveyor 3, two and a half years after it had
landed on the Moon.

In a curious postscript to the Apollo missions, in the
1990s an “urban legend” arose that the Moon landings had never taken place and were merely an elaborate hoax by NASA. While amusing, this legend does not hold up
under even the slightest scientific scrutiny. For example, believers
in the “Moon hoax” cannot explain why the rocks brought back
from the Moon are substantially different in their chemistry from
Earth rocks, as we will see later in this chapter. It makes as much
sense to ask “Do you believe that humans actually went to the
Moon?” as it does to ask “Do you believe there was a First World
War?” or “Do you believe there is such a place as Antarctica?”
Between 1966 and 1976, a series of unmanned Soviet spacecraft also orbited the Moon and soft-landed on its surface. The
first soft landing, by Luna 9, came four months before the U.S.
Surveyor 1 arrived. The first lunar satellite, Luna 10, orbited the
Moon four months before Lunar Orbiter 1. In the 1970s, robotic
spacecraft named Luna 17 and Luna 21 landed vehicles that
roamed the lunar surface, and Lunas 16, 20, and 24 brought samples of rock back to the Earth. The Luna samples complement
those returned by the Apollo astronauts because they were taken
from different parts of the Moon’s surface.

the lunar surface. The areas of highest concentration (red) coincide
closely with the maria on the near side (compare Figure 10-7), confirming
that the maria formed from iron-rich lavas. The lowest iron concentration
(blue) is found in the lunar highlands. (No data were collected in the gray
areas.) The large green region of intermediate iron concentration on the
far side is the South Pole–Aitken Basin (see Figure 10-7). The impact that
created this basin may have excavated all the way to the Moon’s mantle,
in which iron is more abundant than in the crust. (JSC/NASA)

tended to test lightweight imaging systems for future defense
satellites, Clementine proved to be a remarkable tool for lunar exploration. It carried an array of very high-resolution cameras sensitive to ultraviolet and infrared light as well as the visible spectrum
(see Figure 10-7). Different types of materials on the lunar surface reflect different wavelengths, so analysis of Clementine images made in different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum has
revealed the composition of large areas of the Moon’s surface
(Figure 10-10). The task of analyzing the Moon’s surface composition was carried out in even greater depth by the European
Space Agency’s SMART-1 spacecraft, which orbited the Moon
from 2004 to 2006 and carried even more sensitive instruments
than Clementine.
One remarkable result of the Clementine mission was evidence for a patch of water ice tens or hundreds of kilometers
across at the Moon’s south pole, in low-lying locations where
sunlight never reaches and where temperatures are low enough to
prevent ice from evaporating. Radio waves beamed from Clementine toward these areas were detected by radio telescopes on the
Earth and showed the characteristic signature of reflection from ice.

Data from the Lunar Prospector spacecraft, which
went into orbit around the Moon in January 1998, reinforced the Clementine findings and indicated that
even more ice might lie in deep craters at the Moon’s north pole.
The ice may have been deposited by comets (see Section 7-5) that

One complication is that the Lunar Prospector observations show only that there is an excess of hydrogen atoms at
the lunar poles. These could be trapped within water molecules
(H2O) or within other, more exotic minerals. At the end of the
Lunar Prospector mission in July 1999, the spacecraft was
crashed into a crater at the lunar south pole in the hope that a
plume of water vapor might rise from the impact site. Although
more than a dozen large Earth-based telescopes watched the
Moon during the impact, no such plume was observed, nor was
any debris of any kind. Radar observations made from Earth in
2003 suggest that if there is ice at the lunar poles, it is in sheets
no more than a few centimeters thick. A new generation of European, Japanese, Indian, Chinese, and U.S. unmanned spacecraft may help provide a definitive answer about ice at the
Moon’s poles.

Moon’s interior

The Moon’s Interior: The Mantle
The Apollo astronauts also set up seismometers on the Moon’s
surface, which made it possible for scientists to investigate the
Moon’s interior using seismic waves just as is done for the Earth
(Section 9-2). It was found that the Moon exhibits far less seismic activity than the Earth. Roughly 3000 moonquakes were detected per year, whereas a similar seismometer on the Earth would
record hundreds of thousands of earthquakes per year. Furthermore, typical moonquakes are very weak. A major terrestrial
earthquake is in the range from 6 to 8 on the Richter scale, while
a major moonquake measures 0.5 to 1.5 on that scale and would
go unnoticed by a person standing near the epicenter.
Analysis of the feeble moonquakes reveals that most originate
600 to 800 km below the surface, deeper than most earthquakes.
On Earth, the deepest earthquakes mark the boundary between
the solid lithosphere and the plastic asthenosphere. This is because the lithosphere is brittle enough to fracture and produce
seismic waves, whereas the deeper rock of the asthenosphere
oozes and flows rather than cracks. We may conclude that the
Moon’s lithosphere is about 800 km thick (Figure 10-11). By contrast, the Earth’s lithosphere is only 50 to 100 km thick.
The lunar asthenosphere extends down to the Moon’s relatively small iron-rich core, which is more than 1400 km below
the lunar surface. The asthenosphere and the lower part of the
lithosphere are presumably composed of relatively dense iron-rich
rocks. The uppermost part of the lithosphere is a lower-density
crust, with an average thickness of about 60 km on the Earthfacing side and up to 100 km on the far side. For comparison,
the thickness of the Earth’s crust ranges from 5 km under the
oceans to about 30 km under major mountain ranges on the con-

The Moon’s Interior: The Core
The Moon landings gave scientists an unprecedented opportunity
to explore an alien world. The Apollo spacecraft were therefore
packed with an assortment of apparatus that the astronauts deployed around the landing sites (see Figure 10-9). For example,
all the missions carried magnetometers, which confirmed that the
present-day Moon has no global magnetic field. However, careful magnetic measurements of lunar rocks returned by the Apollo
astronauts indicated that the Moon did have a weak magnetic
field when the rocks solidified billions of years ago. Hence, the
Moon must originally have had a small, molten, iron-rich core.
(We saw in Section 7-7 that the Earth’s magnetic field is generated by fluid motions in its interior.) The core presumably solidified at least partially as the Moon cooled, so that the lunar
magnetic field disappeared.

More recently, scientists used the Lunar Prospector to
probe the character of the Moon’s core. The spacecraft
made extensive measurements of lunar gravity and of
how the Moon responds when it passes through the Earth’s magnetosphere (Section 9-4). When combined with detailed observations of how the Earth’s tidal forces affect the motions of the
Moon, the data indicate that the present-day Moon has a partially liquid, iron-rich core about 700 km (435 mi) in diameter.
While 32% of the Earth’s mass is in its core, the core of the Moon
contains only 2% to 3% of the lunar mass.

tinents (see Table 9-3). This slightly lopsided distribution of mass
between the near and far sides of the Moon helps to keep the
Moon in synchronous rotation, so that we always see the same
side of the Moon (see Section 4-8).
On the whole, the Moon’s interior is much more rigid and
less fluid than the interior of the Earth. Plate tectonics requires
that there be fluid motion just below a planet’s surface, so it is
not surprising that there is no evidence for plate tectonics on the
lunar surface.

oritic bombardment. This bombardment has pulverized the surface rocks into a layer of fine powder and rock fragments called
the regolith, from the Greek for “blanket of stone” (Figure
10-12). This layer varies in depth from about 2 to 20 m. Just as
the rough-surfaced acoustic tile used in ceilings absorbs sound
waves, the regolith absorbs most of the sunlight that falls on it.
This helps to account for the Moon’s very low albedo (see Table
10-1).

The Origin of Moonquakes

In addition to their observations of six different landing sites, the
Apollo astronauts brought back 2415 individual samples of lunar
material totaling 382 kg (842 lb). In addition, the unmanned
Soviet spacecraft Luna 16, 20, and 24 returned 300 g (2⁄3 lb) from
three other sites on the Moon. This collection of lunar material
has provided important information about the early history of the
Moon that could have been obtained in no other way.
All of the lunar samples are igneous rocks; there are no
metamorphic or sedimentary rocks (see Section 9-3, especially
Figure 9-19). This suggests that most or all of the Moon’s
surface was once molten. Indeed, Moon rocks are composed
mostly of the same minerals that are found in volcanic rocks
on Earth.
Astronauts who visited the maria discovered that these dark
regions of the Moon are covered with basaltic rock quite similar
to the dark-colored rocks formed by lava from volcanoes on

Earthquakes tend to occur at the boundaries between tectonic
plates, where plates move past each other, collide, or undergo
subduction (see Figure 9-14). But there are no plate motions on
the Moon. What, then, causes moonquakes? The answer turns
out to be the Earth’s tidal forces. Just as the tidal forces of the
Sun and Moon deform the Earth’s oceans and give rise to ocean
tides (see Figure 4-26), the Earth’s tidal forces deform the solid
body of the Moon. The amount of the deformation changes as
the Moon moves around its elliptical orbit and the Earth-Moon
distance varies. As a result, the body of the Moon flexes slightly,
triggering moonquakes. The tidal stresses are greatest when the
Moon is nearest the Earth—that is, at perigee (see Section 3-5)—
which is just when the Apollo seismometers reported the most
moonquakes. Box 10-1 has more information about how the
tidal stresses on the Moon depend on its distance from Earth.
Without tectonics, and without the erosion caused by an atmosphere or oceans, the only changes occurring today on the lunar surface are those due to meteoroid impacts. These impacts
were also monitored by the seismometers left on the Moon by
the Apollo astronauts. These devices, which remained in operation for several years, were sensitive enough to detect a hit by a
grapefruit-sized meteoroid anywhere on the lunar surface. The
data show that every year the Moon is struck by 80 to 150 meteoroids having masses between 0.1 and 1000 kg (roughly 1⁄4 lb
to 1 ton).

One of the most important scientific goals of the Apollo
missions was to learn as much as possible about the
lunar surface. Although only one of the 12 astronauts
who visited the Moon was a professional geologist, all of the astronauts received intensive training in field geology, and they
were in constant communication with planetary scientists on
Earth as they explored the lunar surface.

Calculating Tidal Forces
he gravitational force between any two objects decreases
with increasing distance between the objects. This principle
T
leads to a simple formula for estimating the tidal force that the

Objects, each of mass m

Earth exerts on parts of the Moon.
Consider two small objects, each of mass m, on opposite
sides of the Moon. Because the two objects are at different distances from the Earth’s center, the Earth exerts different forces
Fnear and Ffar on them (see the accompanying illustration). The
consequence of this difference is that the two objects tend to
pull away from each other and away from the center of the
Moon (see Section 4-8, especially Figure 4-23). The tidal force
on these two objects, which is the force that tends to pull them
apart, is the difference between the forces on the individual
objects:
Ftidal ⫽ Fnear ⫺ Ffar
Both Fnear and Ffar are inversely proportional to the square of
the distance from the Earth (see Section 4-7). If this distance
were doubled, both forces would decrease to 1⁄22 ⫽ 1⁄4 of their
original values. But the tidal force Ftidal, which is the difference
between these two forces, decreases even more rapidly with
distance: It is inversely proportional to the cube of the distance
from the Earth to the Moon. That is, doubling the Earth-Moon
distance decreases the tidal force to 1⁄23 ⫽ 1⁄8 of its original
value. If we use the symbols MEarth for the Earth’s mass

In contrast to the dark maria, the lunar highlands are composed of a light-colored rock called anorthosite (Figure 10-14).
On the Earth, anorthositic rock is found only in such very old
mountain ranges as the Adirondacks in the eastern United States.
In comparison to the mare basalts, which have more of the heavier elements like iron, manganese, and titanium, anorthosite is

less dense than basalt. During the period when the Moon’s surface was molten, the less dense anorthosite rose to the top, forming the terrae that make up the majority of the present-day lunar
surface.
Although anorthosite is the dominant rock type in the lunar
highlands, most of the rock samples collected there were not pure
anorthosite but rather impact breccias. These are composites of
different rock types that were broken apart, mixed, and fused
together by a series of meteoritic impacts (Figure 10-15). The

Review: To put our result into perspective, let’s compare it to
the weight of a 1-kg rock on the Moon. The weight of an
object is equal to its mass multiplied by the acceleration due
to gravity (see Section 4-6). This acceleration is equal to
9.8 m/s2 on Earth, but is only 0.17 as great on the Moon.
So, the weight of a 1-kg rock on the Moon is
0.17 ⫻ 1 kg ⫻ 9.8 m/s2 ⫽ 1.7 newtons
Thus, the tidal force on lunar rocks is much less than their
weight. This is a good thing: If the tidal force (which tries to
pull a rock away from the Moon’s center) were greater than
the weight (which pulls it toward the Moon’s center), loose objects would levitate off the Moon’s surface and fly into space!
The tidal force of the Earth on the Moon deforms the solid
body of the Moon, so that it acquires tidal bulges on its near
and far sides. The mass of each bulge must be proportional to
the tidal force that lifts lunar material away from the Moon’s
center. So, the above formula tells us that the mass of each
bulge is inversely proportional to the cube of the Earth-Moon

EXAMPLE: Compare the net tidal force on the Moon at
perigee (when it is closest to the Earth) and at apogee (when
it is farthest away).

Situation: We are asked to compare the tidal forces on the
Moon at two different distances from the Earth. To do this,
we will find the ratio of the tidal force at perigee to the tidal
force at apogee.
Tools: We use the equation given above for the net tidal
force on the Moon.
Answer: The Earth-Moon distances at perigee and apogee are
given in Table 10-1. If we take the ratio of the tidal forces at
these two distances, the constants (including the unknown
quantity A) cancel out:

405,500 km
⫽ ᎏᎏ
363,000 km

(Determining the value of the constant A requires knowing how easily the Moon deforms, which is a complicated
problem beyond our scope.) We can then use our formula for
the tidal force Ftidal to tell us the net tidal force on the Moon.
To do this, we think of the objects of mass m on opposite sides
of the Moon as being the tidal bulges. So, we substitute mbulge
for m in the tidal force formula:
Ftidal-net

Thus, the net tidal force on the Moon is inversely proportional to the sixth power of the Earth-Moon distance. Even a
small decrease in this distance can cause a substantial increase
in the net tidal force.

Review: Our result tells us that the net tidal force at perigee

Tidal forces on the Moon help create the stresses that
generate moonquakes, so it is not surprising that these
quakes are more frequent at perigee than at apogee.

prevalence of breccias is evidence that the lunar highlands have
undergone eons of bombardment from space.
Every rock found on Earth, even those from the driest
desert, has some water locked into its mineral structure. But lunar rocks are totally dry. With the exception of ice at the lunar
poles (see Section 10-2), there is no evidence that water has ever
existed on the Moon. Because the Moon lacks both an atmosphere and liquid water, it is not surprising that no traces of
life have ever been found there.

By carefully measuring the abundances of trace amounts of
radioactive elements in lunar samples and applying the principles
of radioactive dating (see Section 8-2), geologists have determined
that lunar rocks formed more than 3 billion years ago. Of these
ancient rocks, however, anorthosite is much older than the mare
basalts. Typical anorthositic specimens from the highlands are between 4.0 and 4.3 billion years old. All these extremely ancient
specimens are probably samples of the Moon’s original crust. In
sharp contrast, all the mare basalts are between 3.1 and 3.8 bil-

Mare Basalt This 1.53-kg (3.38-lb) specimen of mare basalt was brought
back by the crew of Apollo 15. Gas must have dissolved under pressure in
the lava from which this rock solidified. When the lava reached the airless
lunar surface, the pressure on the lava dropped and the gas formed
bubbles. Some of the bubbles were frozen in place as the rock cooled,
forming the holes on its surface. (Figure 9-19a shows a sample of basalt

lion years old. With no plate tectonics to bring fresh material to
the surface, no new anorthosites or basalts have formed on the
Moon for more than 3 billion years.

the rate of impacts on the Moon has changed over the ages. The ancient, heavily cratered lunar highlands are evidence of an intense
bombardment that dominated the Moon’s early history. For nearly
a billion years, rocky debris left over from the formation of the planets rained down upon the Moon’s young surface. As Figure 10-16
shows, this barrage extended from 4.56 billion years ago, when the
Moon’s surface solidified, until about 3.8 billion years ago. At its
peak, this bombardment from space would have produced a new
crater of about 1 km radius somewhere on the Moon about once
per century. (If this seems like a long time interval, remember that
we are talking about a bombardment that lasted hundreds of millions of years and produced millions of craters over that time.)
The rate of impacts should have tapered off as meteoroids
and planetesimals were swept up by the newly formed planets. In
fact, radioactive dating shows that the impact rate spiked upward
between 4.0 and 3.8 billion years ago (see Figure 10-16). One
proposed explanation is that the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn
changed slightly but suddenly about 4.0 billion years ago during
the process of settling into their present-day orbits. This would
have changed the gravitational forces that these planets exerted
on the asteroid belt and could have disturbed the orbits of many
asteroids, sending them careening toward the inner solar system.
Whatever the explanation for the final epoch of heavy bombardment, major impacts during this period gouged out the mare
basins. Between 3.8 and 3.1 billion years ago iron-rich magma
oozed up from the Moon’s still-molten mantle, flooding the mare
basins with lava that solidified to form basalt (see the Cosmic
Connections figure).
The relative absence of craters in the maria (see Figure 10-5)
tells us that the impact rate has been quite low since the lava solidified. During these past 3.1 billion years the Moon’s surface
has changed very little.

The History of Lunar Cratering

the sites where the rocks were collected, geologists have found that

Impact Breccias These rocks are evidence of the Moon’s long history of
bombardment from space. Parts of the Moon’s original crust were
shattered and strewn across the surface by meteoritic impacts. Later
impacts compressed and heated this debris, welding it into the type of
rock shown here. Such impact breccias are rare on Earth but abundant on
the Moon. (NASA)

The lunar rocks collected by the Apollo and Luna missions have
provided essential information about the history of the Moon. In
particular, they have helped astronomers come to a consensus
about one of the most important questions in lunar science: Where
did the Moon come from?

missions left on the Moon—a set of reflectors, similar to the orange and red ones found in automobile taillights. Since 1969, scientists on Earth have been firing pulses of laser light at these
reflectors and measuring very accurately the length of time it
takes each pulse to return to Earth. Knowing the speed of light,
they can use this data to calculate the distance to the Moon to an
accuracy of just 3 centimeters. They have found that the Moon is
moving away from the Earth at a very gradual rate of 3.8 cm per
year—which is just what Darwin predicted.
As the Moon moves away from the Earth, its sidereal period
is getting longer in accordance with Kepler’s third law (see Section 4-7). At the same time, friction between the oceans and the
body of the Earth is gradually slowing the Earth’s rotation. The
length of the Earth’s day is therefore increasing, by approximately
0.002 second per century.

Theories of the Moon’s Origins
These observations mean that in the distant past, the Earth was
spinning faster than it is now and the Moon was much closer.
Darwin theorized that the early Earth may have been spinning so
fast that a large fraction of its mass tore away, and that this fraction coalesced to form the Moon. This is called the fission theory
of the Moon’s origin. Prior to the Apollo program, two other theories were in competition with the fission theory. The capture theory posits that the Moon was formed elsewhere in the solar system
and then drawn into orbit about the Earth by gravitational forces.
By contrast, the co-creation theory proposes that the Earth and
the Moon were formed at the same time but separately.
One fact used to support the fission theory was that the
Moon’s average density (3344 kg/m3) is comparable to that of the
Earth’s outer layers, as would be expected if the Moon had been

Seventy years before the first spacecraft landed on the Moon, the
British astronomer George Darwin (second son of the famous
evolutionist Charles Darwin) deduced that the Moon must be
slowly moving away from the Earth. He began with the notion
that the Moon’s tidal forces elongate the oceans into a football
shape (see Section 4-8, especially Figure 4-26). However, the long
axis of this “football” does not point precisely at the Moon. The
Earth spins on its axis more rapidly than the Moon revolves
around the Earth, and this rapid rotation carries the tidal bulge
about 10° ahead of a line connecting the Earth and Moon (Figure 10-17). This misaligned bulge produces a small but steady
gravitational force that tugs the Moon forward and lifts it into an
ever larger orbit around the Earth. In other words, Darwin concluded that the Moon must be spiraling away from the Earth.
It became possible to test Darwin’s conclusions with the aid
of a simple device that the Apollo 11, 14, and 15 and Luna 21

flung out of a rapidly rotating proto-Earth. However, the fission
theory predicts that lunar and terrestrial rocks should be similar in
composition. In fact, samples returned from the Moon by the Apollo
and Luna missions show that they are significantly different.
Volatile elements (such as potassium and sodium) boil at relatively low temperatures under 900°C, whereas refractory elements (such as titanium, calcium, and aluminum) boil at 1400°C
or higher. Compared with terrestrial rocks, the lunar rocks have
slightly greater proportions of the refractory elements and slightly
lesser proportions of the volatile elements. This suggests that the
Moon formed from material that was heated to a higher temperature than that from which the Earth formed. Some of the volatile
elements boiled away, leaving the young moon relatively enriched
in the refractory elements.

Proponents of the capture theory used these differences to argue that the Moon formed elsewhere and
was later captured by the Earth. They also noted that
the plane of the Moon’s orbit is close to the plane of the ecliptic,
as would be expected if the Moon had originally been in orbit
about the Sun but was later captured by the Earth.
There are difficulties with the capture theory, however. If the
Earth did capture the Moon intact, then a host of conditions must
have been satisfied entirely by chance. The Moon must have
coasted to within 50,000 km of the Earth at exactly the right
speed to leave a solar orbit and must have gone into orbit around
the Earth without actually hitting our planet.
Proponents of the co-creation theory argued that it is easier
for a planet to capture swarms of tiny rocks. In this theory the
Moon formed from just such rocky debris. Great numbers of rock
fragments orbited the newborn Sun in the plane of the ecliptic
along with the protoplanets. Heat generated in collisions could
have baked the volatile elements out of these smaller rock fragments. Then, just as planetesimals accreted to form the protoEarth in orbit about the Sun, the fragments in orbit about the
Earth accreted to form the Moon.

The Collisional Ejection Theory
The present scientific consensus is that none of these three
theories—fission, capture, and co-creation—is correct. Instead,
the evidence points toward an idea proposed in 1975 by William
Hartmann and Donald Davis and independently by Alastair
Cameron and William Ward. In this collisional ejection theory,
the proto-Earth was struck off-center by a Mars-sized object, and
this collision ejected debris from which the Moon formed.
The collisional ejection theory agrees with what we know
about the early history of the solar system. We saw in Section 8-4
that smaller objects collided and fused together to form the inner
planets. Some of these collisions must have been quite spectacular, especially near the end of planet
formation, when most of the mass The difference in
of the inner solar system was con- chemical composition
tained in a few dozen large proto- between lunar rocks and
planets. The collisional ejection Earth rocks helps to
theory proposes that one such pro- constrain theories of the
toplanet struck the proto-Earth
Moon’s origin
about 4.51 billion years ago, about

halfway between the age of the solar system (4.56 billion years)
and the age of the oldest known Moon rocks (4.47 billion years).
Figure 10-18 shows the results of a supercomputer simulation of
this cataclysm. In the simulation, energy released during the collision produces a huge plume of vaporized rock that squirts out
from the point of impact. As this ejected material cools, it coalesces to form the Moon. The tidal effects depicted in Figure 10-17
then cause the size of the Moon’s orbit to gradually increase.
The collisional ejection theory also agrees with many properties of lunar rocks and of the Moon as a whole. For example,
rock vaporized by the impact would have been depleted of volatile
elements and water, leaving the moon rocks we now know. If the
off-center collision took place after chemical differentiation had
occurred on the Earth, so that our planet’s iron had sunk to its
center, then relatively little iron would have been ejected to become part of the Moon. This explains the Moon’s low density
and the small size of its iron core. It also explains a curious property of the South Pole–Aitken Basin (see Figure 10-7), where an
ancient impact excavated the surface down to a depth of 12 km.
Data from the Clementine spacecraft show that iron concentration in this basin is only 10% (see Figure 10-10), far less than the
20–30% concentration at a corresponding depth below the Earth’s
surface.

An Overview of the Moon’s History
We can now summarize the entire geologic history of the Moon.
The surface of the newborn Moon was probably molten for many
years, both from heat released during the impact of rock fragments falling into the young satellite and from the decay of shortlived radioactive isotopes. As the Moon gradually cooled,
low-density lava floating on the Moon’s surface began to solidify
into the anorthositic crust that exists today. The barrage of rock
fragments that ended about 3.8 billion years ago produced the
craters that cover the lunar highlands.
During the relatively brief period of heavy bombardment between 4.0 and 3.8 billion years ago (see Figure 10-16), more than
a dozen asteroid-size objects, each measuring at least 100 km
across, struck the Moon and blasted out the vast mare basins.
Meanwhile, heat from the decay of long-lived radioactive elements like uranium and thorium began to melt the inside of the
Moon. From 3.8 to 3.1 billion years ago, great floods of molten
rock gushed up from the lunar interior, filling the impact basins
and creating the basaltic maria we see today.
Very little has happened on the Moon since those ancient
times. A few relatively fresh craters have been formed, but the astronauts visited a world that has remained largely unchanged for
more than 3 billion years. During that same period on the Earth,
by contrast, the continents have been totally transformed time
and time again (see Section 9-3).
Many questions and mysteries still remain. The six American
and three Soviet lunar landings have brought back samples from
only nine locations, barely scratching the lunar surface. We still
know very little about the Moon’s far side and poles. Are there
really vast ice deposits at the poles? How much of the Moon’s interior is molten? Just how large is its iron core? How old are the
youngest lunar rocks? Did lava flows occur over western Oceanus
Procellarum only 2 billion years ago, as crater densities there sug-

Key Ideas
Appearance of the Moon: The Earth-facing side of the Moon displays light-colored, heavily cratered highlands and dark-colored,
smooth-surfaced maria. The Moon’s far side has almost no maria.

W. H. Freeman, 2007)

Internal Structure of the Moon: Much of our knowledge about
the Moon has come from human exploration in the 1960s and
early 1970s and from more recent observations by unmanned
spacecraft.
• Analysis of seismic waves and other data indicates that the
Moon has a crust thicker than that of the Earth (and thickest on
the far side of the Moon), a mantle with a thickness equal to
about 80% of the Moon’s radius, and a small iron core.
• The Moon’s lithosphere is far thicker than that of the Earth.
The lunar asthenosphere probably extends from the base of the
lithosphere to the core.
• The Moon has no global magnetic field today, although it had
a weak magnetic field billions of years ago.
Geologic History of the Moon: The anorthositic crust exposed in
the highlands was formed between 4.3 and 4.0 billion years ago.
An era of heavy bombardment formed the maria basins between
4.0 and 3.8 billion years ago, and the mare basalts solidified between 3.8 and 3.1 billion years ago.
• The Moon’s surface has undergone very little change over the
past 3 billion years.

252

Chapter 10

• Meteoroid impacts have been the only significant “weathering”
agent on the Moon. The Moon’s regolith, or surface layer of
powdered and fractured rock, was formed by meteoritic action.
• All of the lunar rock samples are igneous rocks formed largely
of minerals found in terrestrial rocks. The lunar rocks contain no
water and also differ from terrestrial rocks in being relatively
enriched in the refractory elements and depleted in the volatile
elements.
Origin of the Moon: The collisional ejection theory of the Moon’s
origin holds that the proto-Earth was struck by a Mars-sized protoplanet and that debris from this collision coalesced to form the
Moon. This theory successfully explains most properties of the
Moon.
• The Moon was molten in its early stages, and the anorthositic
crust solidified from low-density magma that floated to the lunar
surface. The mare basins were created later by the impact of planetesimals and filled with lava from the lunar interior.
• Tidal interactions between the Earth and Moon are slowing the
Earth’s rotation and pushing the Moon away from the Earth.

Problem-solving tips and tools
Recall that the average density of an object is its mass divided
by its volume. The volume of a sphere is 4␲r3/3, where r is
the sphere’s radius. The surface area of a sphere of radius r
is 4␲r 2, while the surface area of a circle of radius r is ␲r 2.
Recall also that the acceleration of gravity on the Earth’s
surface is 9.8 m/s2. You may find it useful to know that a
1-pound (1-lb) weight presses down on the Earth’s surface
with a force of 4.448 newtons. You might want to review
Newton’s universal law of gravitation in Section 4-7. The
time to travel a certain distance is equal to the distance traveled divided by the speed of motion. Consult Table 10-1 and
the Appendices for any additional data.

to the diameter of the Sun? Is it a good approximation to say
that the Earth orbits around the center of the Sun?
If you view the Moon through a telescope, you will find that
details of its craters and mountains are more visible when the
Moon is near first quarter phase or third quarter phase than
when it is at full phase. Explain why.
In a whimsical moment during the Apollo 14 mission, astronaut Alan Shepard hit two golf balls over the lunar surface.

How much does that person weigh on the Earth?
Using the diameter and mass of the Moon given in Table

kg/m3. Explain why this average density implies that the Moon’s
interior contains much less iron than the interior of the Earth.
In Box 10-1 we calculated the tidal force that the Earth exerts on two 1-kg rocks located on the near and far sides of
the Moon. We assumed that the Earth-Moon distance was
equal to its average value. Repeat this calculation (a) for the
Moon at perigee and (b) for the Moon at apogee. (c) What
is the ratio of the tidal force on the rocks at perigee to the
tidal force at apogee?
The youngest lunar anorthosites are 4.0 billion years old, and
the youngest mare basalts are 3.1 billion years old. Would
you expect to find any impact breccias on the Moon that
formed less than 3.1 billion years ago? Explain your answer.
In the maria, the lunar regolith is about 2 to 8 meters deep.
In the lunar highlands, by contrast, it may be more than 15
meters deep. Explain how the different ages of the maria and
highlands can account for these differences.
The mare basalts are volcanic rock. Is it likely that active volcanoes exist anywhere on the Moon today? Explain.
Calculate the round-trip travel time for a pulse of laser light
that is fired from a point on the Earth nearest the Moon, hits
a reflector at the point on the Moon nearest the Earth, and
returns to its point of origin. Assume that the Earth and
Moon are at their average separation from each other.
Before the Apollo missions to the Moon, there were two diametrically opposite schools of thought about the history of
lunar geology. The “cold moon” theory held that all lunar
surface features were the result of impacts. The most violent
impacts melted the surface rock, which then solidified to
form the maria. The opposite “hot moon” theory held that
all lunar features, including maria, mountains, and craters,
were the result of volcanic activity. Explain how lunar rock
samples show that neither of these theories is entirely correct.
When the Moon originally coalesced, it may have been only
one-tenth as far from the Earth as it is now. (a) When the
Moon first coalesced, was the Earth’s tidal force strong
enough to lift rocks off the lunar surface? Explain. (b) Compared with the net tidal force that the Earth exerts on the
Moon today, how many times larger was the net tidal force

Observing tips and tools

If you do not have access to a telescope, you can
learn a lot by observing the Moon through binoculars. Note that the Moon will appear right-side-up through
binoculars but inverted through a telescope; if you are using
a map of the Moon to aid your observations, you will need
to take this into account. Inexpensive maps of the Moon can
be purchased from most good bookstores or educational supply stores. You can determine the phase of the Moon either
by looking at a calendar (most of which tell you the dates of
new moon, first quarter, full moon, and third quarter), by
checking the weather page of your newspaper, by consulting
the current issue of Sky & Telescope or Astronomy magazine, by using the Starry Night Enthusiast™ program, or by

hese images above show the three planets that share the inner solar system with our Earth. All three have solid surfaces, and, in principle, a properly protected astronaut could
stand on any of them. The differences between these three worlds,
however, are pronounced.
Mercury is small, airless, and extensively cratered. It is also
mysterious: Half of its surface has never been viewed at close
range, and it has a perplexing and unexpected magnetic field. It
also rotates in a manner unique in the solar system, spinning three
times on its axis for every two orbits around the Sun.
Venus is nearly the same size as Earth, but it is shrouded by
a perpetual cloud cover that hides its surface from view. To penetrate the clouds and learn what lies beneath, two advanced technologies were needed: radar, which allowed astronomers to “see”

continents but merely highlands (shown in red) that rise gently
above the planet’s lower-lying areas (shown in blue). We have

Mars has captivated the popular imagination like no other
planet. But rather than being the abode of warlike aliens, Mars
proves to be an enigmatic world. Some parts of its surface are
drier than any desert on Earth, while other locations show evidence of having been underwater for extended periods. Our challenge is to understand how these three nominally Earthlike worlds
evolved to be so unique and so different than our own Earth.

Chapter 11

At various times Mercury, Venus, and Mars are among the brightest objects in the sky. At their greatest brilliance, each of these
planets appears brighter than any star, which is why they have
been known since ancient times and why their motions played a
role in the religious beliefs of many ancient cultures.

Naked-Eye Observations of Mercury and Venus

CAUTION! Remember that “greatest western elongation” and
“greatest eastern elongation” refer to a planet’s position in the
sky relative to the Sun. When Mercury or Venus is at greatest
western elongation, it is west of the Sun in the sky and has already risen at dawn when the Sun is rising in the east. When
Mercury or Venus is at greatest eastern elongation, it is east of
the Sun in the sky and is still above the horizon when the Sun
sets in the west.

INK 1

Because Mercury’s orbit is so close to the Sun, its maximum elongation is only 28° and it is quite difficult to
observe. (It is said that Copernicus never saw it.) The
celestial sphere appears to rotate at 15° per hour (360° divided
by 24 hours), so Mercury never rises more than 2 hours before
sunrise or sets more than 2 hours after sunset. Unfortunately,
Mercury’s orbit is very elliptical (its eccentricity of 0.206 is greater
than that of any other planet) and is inclined to the ecliptic—the
plane of the Earth’s orbit around the Sun—by about 7°. As a result, at greatest elongation Mercury is often much less than 28°
from the horizon at sunset or sunrise. Hence, some elongations

11-2 shows. A total of six or seven greatest elongations (both
eastern and western) occur each year, but usually only two of
these will be favorable for viewing the planet.

We get the best view of either Mercury or Venus when it appears as far from the Sun in the sky as it can be, at its greatest

greatest eastern elongation, Mercury or Venus appears after sun-

set over the western horizon as an “evening star.” On dates near

“morning star” that rises before the Sun in the eastern sky.

The orbit of Venus is about twice the size of Mercury’s
orbit, nearly circular, and inclined to the ecliptic by
only 3.39°. As a result, Venus can be seen about 47°
away from the Sun and all elongations are nearly equally favorable. At greatest eastern elongation, which occurs at intervals of
about 19 months, Venus sets in the west about 3 hours after sunset. About 5 months later Venus is at greatest western elongation
and rises in the east about 3 hours before sunrise.
At its greatest brilliance, Venus is 16 times brighter than Sirius and is outshone only by the Sun and the Moon. Venus is more
brilliant than Mercury because it is relatively large (more than
double the diameter of Mercury and almost the same size as the

Earth) and has a much higher albedo of 0.59 (it reflects 59% of
the sunlight that falls on it).

Naked-Eye Observations of Mars
BL

INK 1

Unlike Mercury and Venus, Mars is a superior planet
with an orbit larger than the Earth’s orbit. As Table
11-3 shows, its orbital semimajor axis is a ⫽ 1.524 AU
(227.9 million kilometers, or 141.6 million miles). Hence, Mars
and the Sun are sometimes on opposite sides of the sky as seen
from Earth—that is, Mars is at opposition (see Figure 4-6)—and
appears high in our night sky. Such oppositions occur at intervals
of about 780 days. However, some oppositions provide better
views of Mars than others because Mars has a noticeably elongated orbit (Figure 11-3). As a result, we get the best view of
Mars when it is simultaneously at opposition and near the perihelion of its elliptical orbit, a configuration called a favorable
opposition. The Earth-Mars distance can then be as small as
0.37 AU, or 56 million kilometers (35 million miles), and the angular diameter of Mars can be as large as 25.1 arcsec—about the
same as a person’s head seen at a distance of 1.6 km (1 mile). Under these conditions, Mars appears in the nighttime sky as a brilliant red object 31⁄2 times brighter than Sirius.
1.7

Like all the planets, Mercury shines by reflected sunlight. Because it orbits so close to the Sun, it is exposed to sunlight that
on average is about 7 times as intense as on the Earth. Furthermore, Mercury is never more than 1.5 AU from Earth. These factors explain why Mercury can have up to twice the brightness of
Sirius, the brightest star in the nighttime sky. Mercury would be
even brighter if its surface did not have a rather low albedo of
0.12 (that is, it reflects only about 12% of the sunlight that falls
on it—about the same as weathered asphalt).

Unfortunately, the time from one favorable opposition to the
next is about 15 years. Hence, astronomers take advantage of all
oppositions, even the not-so-favorable ones, to observe Mars.
When Mars is at opposition but near aphelion the Earth-Mars
distance can be as large as 0.68 AU, or 101 million kilometers
(63 million miles).

Telescopic Views of Mercury, Venus, and Mars
Naked-eye observations of Mercury are best made at dusk or
dawn, but the best telescopic views are obtained in the daytime
when the planet is high in the sky, far above the degrading atmospheric effects near the horizon. A yellow filter can eliminate much
of the blue light from our sky. The photograph in Figure 11-4a,
which is among the finest Earth-based views of Mercury, was

While an Earth-based telescope reveals some surface details
on Mercury, Venus appears almost completely featureless, with
neither continents nor mountains (see Figure 4-13). Astronomers
soon realized that they were not seeing the true surface of the
planet. Rather, Venus must be covered by a thick, unbroken layer
of clouds. A cloud layer would also explain why Venus reflects
such a large fraction of the sunlight that falls on it. Direct evidence that Venus has a thick atmosphere came when nineteenthcentury astronomers observed Venus near the time of inferior
conjunction. This is when Venus lies most nearly between the
Earth and the Sun, so that we see the planet lit from behind. As
Figure 11-4b shows, sunlight is scattered by Venus’s atmosphere,
producing a luminescent ring around the planet that would not
otherwise be present. No such ring is seen around Mercury at inferior conjunction, which indicates that Mercury has no appreciable atmosphere.

Mercury, Venus, and Mars: Earthlike yet Unique

Unlike airless Venus or cloud-shrouded Venus, Mars has a
thin, almost cloudless atmosphere that permits a clear view of the
surface. Under the right conditions, a relatively small telescope
can reveal substantial detail on the Martian surface. Figure 11-4c
shows an image of Mars during the very favorable 2003 opposition, when Mars was closer to Earth than it had been in several
thousand years. The thin strip of blue and orange around the
right-hand edge of Mars in this image is caused by the Martian
atmosphere. This image also shows that different parts of the
Martian surface have different colors. Most striking are the
whitish ice caps at the Martian poles, which bear a striking superficial resemblance to the Arctic and Antarctic regions on Earth.

CAUTION! Although Mars appears bright red to Earth observers, its surface is actually reddish-brown. A sunlit brown
surface, if surrounded by the blackness of space, is perceived by
the human eye as having a red color.

11-2 While Mars rotates much like the
Earth, Mercury’s rotation is coupled to its
orbital motion and Venus’s rotation is slow
and retrograde
We have seen that the surface of Mars is relatively easy to observe
with visible-light telescopes. By contrast, only a few faint, hazy
markings can be seen on Mercury’s surface, and the surface of
Venus is perpetually hidden by
clouds. These differences explain Radar technology
why the rotation of Mars has been revealed the curious
well understood since the mid- rotation of Mercury
seventeenth century, while it was not and Venus
until the 1960s that astronomers accurately measured the rotation of Mercury and Venus. As we will
see, Mars rotates in a very Earthlike way, while Mercury and
Venus rotate like no other objects in the solar system.

The Rotation of Mars
BL

INK 1

1.9

The first reliable record of surface features on Mars
was made by the Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens,
who observed the planet during the opposition of 1659.
He identified a prominent dark feature that we now call Syrtis
Major. After observing this feature for several weeks, Huygens
concluded that the rotation period of Mars is approximately 24
hours, the same as the Earth.
In 1666, the Italian astronomer Gian Domenico Cassini made
more-refined observations which showed that a Martian day is
37.5 minutes longer than on Earth. More than a century later, the
German-born English astronomer William Herschel found that
Mars’s axis of rotation is not perpendicular to the plane of the
planet’s orbit, but is tilted by about 25° away from the perpendicular. This is very close to the Earth’s 231⁄2° tilt (see Figure 2-12).
This striking coincidence means that Mars experiences Earthlike
seasons, with opposite seasons in the northern and southern Martian hemispheres (see Section 2-5). Because Mars takes nearly 2
(Earth) years to orbit the Sun, the Martian seasons last nearly
twice as long as on Earth.

261

The Challenge of Observing Mercury’s Rotation
During the 1880s, the Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli
attempted to make the first map of Mercury. Unfortunately,
Schiaparelli’s telescopic views of Mercury were so vague and indistinct that he made an understandable but major error, which
went uncorrected for more than half a century. He erroneously
concluded that Mercury always keeps the same side facing
the Sun.
Many objects in our solar system are in synchronous rotation,
so that their rotation period equals their period of revolution—a
situation also called 1-to-1 spin-orbit coupling. We saw in Section
4-8 how the Earth’s tidal forces keep the Moon in synchronous
rotation, so that it always keeps the same side toward the Earth.
Tidal forces also keep the two moons of Mars with the same side
facing their parent planet, and likewise many of the satellites of
Jupiter and Saturn.
It had been suggested as early as 1865 that the Sun’s tidal
forces would keep Mercury in synchronous rotation. But this is
not how Mercury rotates. The first clue about Mercury’s true rotation period came in 1962, when astronomers detected radio radiation coming from the innermost planet.
As we learned in Sections 5-3 and 5-4, every dense object
(such as a planet) emits electromagnetic radiation with a continuous spectrum. The dominant wavelength of this radiation depends on the object’s temperature. Only at absolute zero does a
dense object emit no radiation at all.
If Mercury exhibited synchronous rotation, one side of the
planet would remain in perpetual, frigid darkness, quite near absolute zero. To test this idea, in 1962 the radio astronomer W. E.
Howard and his colleagues at the University of Michigan began
monitoring radiation from Mercury. (If the planet had one side
that was very cold, most of the emission from that side should
be at quite long wavelengths. Hence, a radio telescope was used
for these observations.) They were surprised to discover that
the temperature on the planet’s nighttime side is about
100 K (⫽ ⫺173°C ⫽ ⫺280°F), not nearly as cold as expected.
These observations were in direct contradiction to the idea of synchronous rotation.
One idea offered to explain Howard’s observations was that
Mercury rotates synchronously, but that winds in the planet’s
atmosphere carried warmth from the daytime side of the planet
around to the nighttime side. But, in fact, there are no winds on
Mercury. Its daytime temperature is too high and its gravity too
weak to retain any substantial atmosphere (see Box 7-2).
The definitive observation was made in 1965, when Rolf B.
Dyce and Gordon H. Pettengill used the giant 1000-ft radio telescope at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico to bounce powerful radar pulses off Mercury. The outgoing radiation consisted
of microwaves of a very specific wavelength. In the reflected signal echoed back from the planet, the wavelength had shifted as a
result of the Doppler effect (see Section 5-9, especially Figure
5-26). As Mercury rotates, one side of the planet approaches the
Earth, while the other side recedes from the Earth. Microwaves
reflected from the planet’s approaching side were shortened in
wavelength, whereas those from its receding side were lengthened
(Figure 11-5). Thus, the radar pulse went out at one specific
wavelength, but it came back spread over a small wavelength

262

Chapter 11

Colombo noted that their result for the rotation period is very
close to two-thirds of Mercury’s sidereal period of 87.969 days:

Measuring Mercury’s Rotation Period As Mercury rotates, one side of
the planet moves away from the Earth and the other side toward the
Earth. If radio waves of a single wavelength are beamed toward Mercury,
waves reflected from these two sides will be Doppler shifted to longer
and shorter wavelengths, respectively. By measuring the wavelength shift
of the reflected radiation, astronomers deduced how rapidly Mercury
rotates and thus determined its rotation period.

range. From the width of this wavelength range, Dyce and
Pettengill deduced that Mercury’s rotation period is approximately 58.6 days.

Spin-Orbit Coupling and the Curious Rotation of Mercury
Giuseppe Colombo, an Italian physicist with a long-standing interest in Mercury, was intrigued by Dyce and Pettingill’s results.

Strong gravitational
force on near
side of Mercury

Colombo therefore boldly speculated that Mercury’s true rotation period is exactly 58.646 days, or 58 days and 151⁄2 hours.
He realized that this figure would mean that Mercury is locked
into a 3-to-2 spin-orbit coupling: The planet makes three complete rotations on its axis for every two complete orbits around
the Sun. No other planet or satellite in the solar system has this
curious relationship between its rotation and its orbital motion.
Figure 11-6 shows how gravitational forces from the Sun
cause Mercury’s 3-to-2 spin-orbit coupling. The force of gravity
decreases with increasing distance, which explains how the Moon
is able to raise a tidal bulge in the Earth’s oceans (see Section
4-8). Mercury has no oceans, but it has a natural bulge of its own;
thanks to the Sun’s tidal forces, the planet is slightly elongated
along one axis. The stronger gravitational force that the Sun exerts on the near side of the planet tends to twist the long axis to
point toward the Sun, as Figure 11-6a shows. Indeed, Mercury’s
long axis would always point toward the Sun if its orbit were circular or nearly so. In this case the same side of Mercury would
always face the Sun, and there would be synchronous rotation
(Figure 11-6b). But Mercury’s orbit has a rather high eccentricity, and the twisting effect on Mercury decreases rapidly as the
planet moves away from the Sun. As a result, Mercury’s long axis
points toward the Sun only at perihelion (Figure 11-6c). From one
perihelion to the next, alternate sides of Mercury face the Sun.

(c) In fact Mercury is in an elliptical orbit,

Figure 11-6
Mercury’s Spin-Orbit Coupling (a) The Sun’s gravitational force on the
near side of Mercury’s long axis is greater than the force on the far side.
This tends to twist the long axis to point toward the Sun. (b) If Mercury
were in a circular orbit, the twisting effect shown in (a) would always
keep the same side of Mercury (shown by a red dot) facing the Sun.

(c) Because Mercury’s orbit is rather elongated, its rotation is more
complex: The end of Mercury’s long axis marked by a red dot faces the
Sun at one perihelion (point 1), but at the next perihelion (point 15) the
opposite end—marked by a blue dot—faces the Sun.

Mercury, Venus, and Mars: Earthlike yet Unique

Because of the 3-to-2 spin-orbit coupling, the average time
from sunrise to sunset on Mercury is just equal to its orbital period, or just under 88 days. This helps explain the tremendous
difference between daytime and nighttime temperatures on Mercury. Not only is sunlight about 7 times more intense on Mercury
than on the Earth (because of the smaller size of Mercury’s orbit),
but that sunlight has almost 3 Earth months to heat up the surface.
As a result, daytime temperatures at the equator are high enough—
about 430°C (roughly 700 K, or 800°F)—to melt lead. (In comparison, a typical kitchen oven reaches only about 300°C or 550°F.)
The time from sunset to the next sunrise is also 88 days, and
the surface thus has almost 3 Earth months of darkness during
which to cool down. Therefore, nighttime temperatures reach to
below ⫺170°C (about 100 K, or ⫺270°F). This is cold enough to
freeze carbon dioxide and methane. The surface of Mercury is
truly inhospitable!
While the Sun moves slowly across Mercury’s sky, it does not
always move from east to west as it does as seen from Earth. The
reason is that Mercury’s speed along its elliptical orbit varies substantially, in accordance with Kepler’s second law (see Section
4-4, especially Figure 4-11). It moves fastest (59 km/s) at perihelion and slowest (39 km/s) at aphelion.
As seen from Mercury’s surface, the Sun rises in the east and
sets in the west, just as it does on the Earth. When Mercury is
near perihelion, however, the planet’s rapid motion along its orbit outpaces its leisurely rotation about its axis (one rotation in
58.646 days). Hence, the usual east-west movement of the Sun
across Mercury’s sky is interrupted, and the Sun actually stops
and moves backward (from west to east) for a few Earth days. If
you were standing on Mercury watching a sunset occurring at
perihelion, the Sun would not simply set. It would dip below the
western horizon and then come back up, only to set a second time
a day or two later.

Observing Venus’s Rotation:
Penetrating the Clouds with Radio
Venus’s perpetual cloud cover makes it impossible to measure the
planet’s rotation using visible-light telescopes. (It is possible to use
visible-light telescopes to track features in the planet’s cloud cover.
But winds in the atmosphere cause such features to move relative
to Venus’s surface, so this approach does not give a direct measurement of how the planet itself rotates.) To penetrate the planet’s
perpetual cloud cover, astronomers applied to Venus the same
technique of using radio waves and the Doppler effect that revealed the rotation of Mercury.
Clouds may contain gas, dust, haze, water droplets, or other
small particles. In general, electromagnetic radiation can pass easily through such a cloud only if the wavelength is large compared
to the size of the particles. We then say that the cloud is transparent to the radiation. For example, clouds in the Earth’s atmosphere are made of water droplets with an average diameter of
about 20 ␮m (2 ⫻ 10⫺5 m, or 20,000 nm). Visible light has wavelengths between 400 to 700 nm, which is less than the droplet
size. Hence, visible light cannot easily pass through such clouds,
which is why cloudy days are darker than sunny days. But radio
waves, with wavelengths of 0.1 m or more, and microwaves, with

263

wavelengths from 10⫺3 m to 0.1 m, can pass through such a
cloud with ease. That is why your mobile phone, radio, or television works just as well on a cloudy or foggy day as on a clear one.
Like clouds in the Earth’s atmosphere, the clouds of Venus
are transparent to radio waves and microwaves. Beginning in the
early 1960s, advances in radio telescope technology made it possible to send microwave radiation to Venus and detect the waves
reflected from its surface. Just as for Mercury (see Figure 11-5),
the Doppler shift of waves reflected from the two sides of Venus
reveal the speed and direction of the planet’s rotation.

Venus: Where the Sun Rises in the West
These measurements show that Venus rotates very slowly; the
sidereal rotation period of the planet is 243.01 days, even longer
than the planet’s 224.7-day orbital period. To an imaginary inhabitant of Venus who could somehow see through the cloud
cover, stars would move across the sky at a rate of only 11⁄2° per
Earth day. As seen from the Earth, by contrast, stars move 11⁄2°
across the sky in just 6 minutes.
Not only does Venus rotate slowly, it also rotates in an unusual direction. Most of the planets in the solar system spin on
their axes in prograde rotation. Prograde means “forward,” and
planets with prograde rotation spin on their axes in the same direction in which they orbit the Sun (Figure 11-7a). As seen from
the surface of a planet with prograde rotation, such as the Earth,
the Sun and stars rise in the east and set in the west.
Venus is an exception to the rule: It spins in retrograde rotation. That is, the direction in which it spins on its axis is backward compared to the direction in which it orbits the Sun, as
Figure 11-7b shows. (Recall that “retrograde” means “backward.”) If an observer on the surface of Venus could see through
the thick layer of clouds, the Sun and stars would rise in the west
and set in the east!

CAUTION! Be careful not to confuse retrograde rotation with
retrograde motion. When Venus is near inferior conjunction, so
that it is passing the Earth on its smaller, faster orbit around the
Sun, it appears to us to move from east to west on the celestial
sphere from one night to the next. This apparent motion is
called retrograde motion, because it is backward to the apparent west-to-east motion that Venus displays most of the time.
(You may want to review the discussion of retrograde motion
in Sections 4-1 and 4-2.) By contrast, the retrograde rotation of
Venus means that it spins on its axis from east to west, rather
than west to east like the Earth.
Venus’s retrograde rotation adds to the puzzle of our solar
system’s origins. If you could view our solar system from a great
distance above the Earth’s north pole, you would see all the planets orbiting the Sun counterclockwise. Closer examination would
reveal that the Sun and most of the planets also rotate counterclockwise on their axes; the exceptions are Venus and Uranus.
Most of the satellites of the planets also move counterclockwise
along their orbits and rotate in the same direction. Thus, the rotation of Venus is not just opposite to its orbital motion; it is opposite to most of the orbital and rotational motions in the solar
system!

11-3 Mercury is cratered like the Moon but

Imagine an alien astronomer observing Earth from Mercury, from
above the clouds of Venus, or from Mars with the same telescope
technology available to our own astronomers. Such an astronomer
would be unable to resolve any features on Earth less than a few
hundred kilometers across. It would be impossible for her to learn
about the Earth’s mountain ranges,
its volcanoes, or even its cities. Earth Spacecraft observations
astronomers face the same limita- at close range
tions in studying the other terrestrial were necessary to
planets. To truly understand these reveal Mercury’s
other worlds, it is essential to study unusual properties
them at close range using spacecraft.
In this section we will see what a single spacecraft has been able
to teach us about Mercury’s surface and interior. Later in this
chapter we will see how a small fleet of spacecraft sent to Venus
and Mars has revolutionized our knowledge of those planets.

The first spacecraft to provide detailed knowledge
about Mercury was Mariner 10. Launched in 1973,
this spacecraft went into an orbit around the Sun that
brought it close to Mercury on three occasions in 1974 and 1975.
The images transmitted back to Earth showed features as small

As we saw in Section 8-4, the Sun and planets formed from
a solar nebula that was initially rotating. (Had it not been rotating, all of the material in the nebula would have fallen inward toward the protosun, leaving nothing to form the planets.) Because
the planets formed from the material of this rotating cloud, they
tend to rotate on their axes in that same direction. It is difficult
to imagine how Venus and Uranus could have bucked this trend.
One theory suggests that the tidal forces exerted by the Sun tended
to elongate Venus’s atmosphere toward the Sun, much as the
Moon’s tidal forces elongate the Earth’s oceans toward the Moon
(see Section 4-8, especially Figure 4-25). Friction between the
atmosphere and Venus’s surface then acted to slow the planet’s
rotation. By themselves, these tidal effects would put Venus into
synchronous prograde rotation. But in addition, the Sun’s heat on
the illuminated side of Venus generates strong winds in the planet’s
atmosphere, and the frictional forces of these winds drive Venus
into slow retrograde rotation.
Venus’s rotation has other puzzling aspects. The length of an
apparent solar day on Venus—that is, from when the Sun is highest in the sky to when it is again highest in the sky (see Section
2-7)—is 116.8 Earth days. Remarkably, this is almost exactly
one-fifth as long as the planet’s 584-day synodic period. (We saw
in Section 4-2 that this is the time between successive inferior conjunctions, when Venus and the Earth are closest together.) Is this
curious ratio the result of gravitational interactions between Venus
and the Earth? Or is it sheer coincidence? No one knows the
answer.

The Mariner 10 images show only one hemisphere of Mercury’s surface, since the time interval between flybys was equal to
twice the planet’s orbital period and 3 times its rotation period.
Hence, the same side of Mercury was illuminated by the Sun during each flyby. The other side of Mercury has yet to be explored

maining after planet formation rained down on these young
worlds, gouging out most of the craters we see today. We saw in
Section 10-4 that the strongest evidence for this chronology comes
from analysis and dating of Moon rocks. Mariner 10 did not land
on Mercury, so we are not able to make the same kind of direct
analysis of rocks from the planet’s surface.
Unlike the Moon, Mercury’s surface has extensive low-lying
plains (examine the upper half of Figure 11-9). These large,
smooth areas are about 2 km lower than the cratered terrain.
These probably have a similar origin to the lunar maria, which
were produced by extensive lava flows between 3.1 and 3.8 billion years ago (see Section 10-4). Primordial lava flows probably
also explain the plains of Mercury. As large meteoroids punctured
the planet’s thin, newly formed crust, lava welled up from the
molten interior to flood low-lying areas.
From the number of craters that pit them, Mercury’s plains
appear to have been formed near the end of the era of heavy bombardment, a little more than 3.8 billion years ago. Mercury’s
plains are therefore older than most of the lunar maria. Analysis
of Mariner 10 images made at different wavelengths also shows
that the material in Mercury’s plains has a lower iron content
than the lunar maria. This is presumably why the plains of Mercury do not have the dark color of the Moon’s maria.

As Mariner 10 closed in on Mercury, scientists were struck by the
Moonlike pictures appearing on their television monitors. It was
obvious that Mercury, like the Moon, is a barren, heavily cratered
world, with no evidence for plate tectonics. This is what we would
expect based on Mercury’s small size (see Table 7-1 and the figure that opens this chapter). As we saw in Section 7-6, a small
world is expected to have little internal heat, and, hence, little or
no geologic activity and an ancient, cratered surface (see Figure
7-11). But craters are not the only features of Mercury’s surface;
there are also gently rolling plains, long, meandering cliffs, and
an unusual sort of jumbled terrain. As we will see, Mercury’s distinctive surface shows that this planet is not merely a somewhat
larger version of the Moon.
Figure 11-9 shows a typical close-up view sent back from
Mariner 10. The consensus among astronomers is that most of
the craters on both Mercury and the Moon were produced during the first 700 million years after the planets formed. Debris re-

Scarps: Evidence of a Wrinkled Planet
Mariner 10 also revealed numerous long cliffs, called scarps, meandering across Mercury’s surface (Figure 11-10). Some scarps
rise as much as 3 km (2 mi) above the surrounding plains and are
20 to 500 km long. These cliffs probably formed as the planet
cooled and contracted.

ANALOGY The shrinkage of Mercury’s crust is probably a result of a general property of most materials: They shrink when
cooled and expand when heated. The lid on a jar of jam makes
a useful analogy. When the jar is kept cold in the refrigerator,
the metal lid contracts more than the glass jar. This makes a
tight seal, but also makes the lid hard to unscrew. You can
loosen the lid by running hot water over it; this makes the metal
lid expand more than the glass jar, helping to break the seal.

In the decades since the Mariner 10 mission, astronomers have continued to study Mercury with both
visible-light and radio telescopes. Radar observations
have detected patches at Mercury’s north and south poles that are
unusually effective at reflecting radio waves. It has been suggested
that these patches may be regions of water ice deep within craters
where the Sun’s rays never reach. (We saw in Section 10-2 that
ice may also exist in shadowed regions at the Moon’s poles.) If
this is correct, then Mercury is truly a world of extremes, with
perpetual ice caps at one or both poles but with midday temperatures at the equator that are high enough to melt lead.

teoroid that penetrated the planet’s crust, allowing lava to flood
out onto the surface and fill the basin. Because relatively few
craters pockmark these lava flows, the Caloris impact must be relatively young. It must have occurred toward the end of the cratermaking period that dominated the first 700 million years of our
solar system’s history.
The impact that created the huge Caloris Basin must have
been so violent that it shook the entire planet. On the side of Mercury opposite the Caloris Basin, Mariner 10 discovered a consequence of this impact—a jumbled, hilly region covering about
500,000 square kilometers, about twice the size of the state of
Wyoming. Geologists theorize that seismic waves from the Caloris
impact became focused as they passed through Mercury. As this
concentrated seismic energy reached the far surface of the planet,
it deformed the surface and created jumbled terrain. (This same
process may also have taken place on the Moon: There is a region of chaotic hills on the side of the Moon directly opposite
from the large impact basin called Mare Orientale.)

1. The floors of these
craters were flooded
by lava from Mercury’s
interior.

If there had still been molten material beneath Mercury’s surface when this contraction took place, lava would have leaked
onto the surface around the scarps. This does not appear to have
happened. Hence, the scarps must have formed relatively late in
Mercury’s history, after the lava flows had ended and after the
planet had solidified to a substantial depth beneath the surface.
With the exception of the scarps, there are no features on Mercury that resemble the boundaries of tectonic plates. Thus, we can
regard Mercury’s crust, like that of the Moon, as a single plate.

Fire and Ice: The Caloris Basin and Mercury’s Poles
The most impressive feature discovered by Mariner 10 was a huge
impact scar called the Caloris Basin (calor is the Latin word for
“heat”). The Sun is directly over the Caloris Basin during alternating perihelion passages, and thus it is the hottest place on the
planet once every 176 days. During each of the Mariner 10 flybys, the Caloris Basin happened to lie on the terminator (the line
dividing day from night; see Section 10-1). Hence, in Figure 11-11
slightly more than half of this basin is hidden on the night side of
the planet.
The Caloris Basin, which measures 1300 km (810 mi) in diameter, is both filled with and surrounded by smooth lava plains.
The basin was probably gouged out by the impact of a large me-

Compared to the Earth’s core, Mercury’s iron-rich core takes
up a much larger fraction of the planet’s volume. Indeed, Mercury is the
most iron-rich planet in the solar system. Surrounding Mercury’s core is a
600-km-thick rocky mantle.

Mercury’s Interior and Iron Core
By measuring how much Mariner 10 was deflected by Mercury’s
gravity, scientists were able to make a precise determination of
Mercury’s mass. Given the mass and the diameter of Mercury,
they could then calculate that the planet has an average density
of 5430 kg/m3. This is quite similar to the Earth’s average density of 5515 kg/m3. We saw in Section 9-2 that typical rocks from
the Earth’s surface have a density of only about 3000 kg/m3 because they are composed primarily of lightweight, mineralforming elements. The higher average density of our planet is

caused by the Earth’s iron core. By studying how the Earth vibrates during earthquakes, geologists have deduced that our
planet’s iron core occupies about 17% of the Earth’s volume.
Pressures inside a planet increase the density of rock by
squeezing its atoms closer together. Because the Earth is 18 times
more massive than Mercury, the weight of this larger mass compresses the Earth’s core much more than Mercury’s core. If the
Earth were uncompressed, its density would be 4400 kg/m3,
whereas Mercury’s uncompressed density would still be a hefty
5300 kg/m3. This higher uncompressed density means that Mercury has a larger proportion of iron than the Earth: An iron core
must occupy about 42% of Mercury’s volume. Mercury is therefore the most iron-rich planet in the solar system. Figure 11-12 is
a scale drawing of the interior structures of Mercury and the
Earth.
Several theories have been proposed to account for Mercury’s
high iron content. According to one theory, the inner regions of
the primordial solar nebula were so warm that only those substances with high condensation temperatures—like iron-rich
minerals—could have condensed into solids. Another theory suggests that a brief episode of very powerful solar winds could have
stripped Mercury of its low-density mantle shortly after the Sun
formed. A third possibility is that during the final stages of planet
formation, Mercury was struck by a large planetesimal. Supercomputer simulations show that this cataclysmic collision would
have ejected much of the lighter mantle, leaving a disproportionate amount of iron to reaccumulate to form the planet we see today (Figure 11-13).

Clues About the Core: Mercury’s Magnetic Field
An important clue to the structure of Mercury’s iron core came
from the Mariner 10 magnetometers, which discovered that Mercury has a magnetic field similar to that of the Earth but only
about 1% as strong. We saw in Section 7-7 that for a planet to
have a global magnetic field, it must have moving liquid material
in its interior that conducts electricity. This moving material acts

as a dynamo and generates the magnetic field. Hence, we conclude that (1) at least part of Mercury’s core must be in a liquid
state, and (2) there must be a source of energy to make material
flow within this liquid region in order to produce electric currents. The second requirement is evidence that Mercury, like the
Earth, also has a solid part of its core: As material deep in the liquid core cools and solidifies to join the solid portion of the core,
it releases the energy needed to stir up the motions of the remaining liquid material. Mercury’s magnetic field therefore suggests
that its core has the same general structure as the Earth’s core (recall Figure 9-9).
Mercury’s magnetic field comes as something of a surprise.
The ancient, cratered surface of Mercury is evidence of a lack of
geologic activity, which in turn shows that Mercury must have
lost the internal heat that powers such activity. This is as we
would expect for such a small planet (see Section 7-6). But the existence of a global magnetic field shows that Mercury is still partially molten inside, which is evidence that the planet has some
internal heat. The evidence from cratering and from the global
magnetic field are thus in contradiction with each other.
Two other observations further complicate our understanding of Mercury’s interior. One is that the amount of electrically
conducting molten material that remains within Mercury is
thought to be too little to account for even the relatively weak
global magnetic field. Another is that a planet must rotate fairly
rapidly in order to stir its molten interior into the kind of motion
that generates a magnetic field. But as we saw in Section 11-2,
Mercury rotates very slowly: It takes 58.646 days to spin on its
axis. We are forced to conclude that we still have much to learn
about the interior of Mercury.

strong enough to carve out a cavity in the solar wind, preventing the
impinging particles from striking the planet’s surface directly. Most of the
particles of the solar wind are deflected around the planet in a turbulent
region colored purple in this scale drawing. (Compare this with the Earth’s
much larger magnetosphere, shown in Figure 9-20.)

Future Exploration of Mercury
Much about Mercury still remains unknown. What is the character of the side of the planet that Mariner 10 did not see? What is

the chemical composition of the surface rocks? Was the surface
of Mercury once completely molten? What caused Mercury to
have such a high iron content? What portion of the planet’s core
is liquid, and what portion is solid? Is there indeed ice perpetually frozen at the poles? Learning the answers will require extensive observations of Mercury by a spacecraft at close range.
LINK 11

One such spacecraft, MESSENGER (MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging), was launched in 2004 and is scheduled to go into
orbit around Mercury in 2011. Its sophisticated instruments will
image the side of the planet that Mariner 10 did not observe,
make detailed measurements of surface composition, and help reveal the nature of Mercury’s core. Another Mercury mission,
BepiColombo, is being planned by the European Space Agency in
collaboration with the Japanese Institute of Space and Astronautical Science. Named for the physicist who first proposed Mercury’s 3-to-2 spin-orbit coupling, BepiColombo is actually two
spacecraft: an orbiter that will study the planet itself and a smaller
orbiter that will explore Mercury’s magnetosphere. If launched as
scheduled in 2013, BepiColombo will reach Mercury in 2019.
Until this new generation of spacecraft begins returning new data,
Mercury will remain one of the most enigmatic worlds of the solar system.

Whatever the origin of Mercury’s magnetic field, we know that it
interacts with the solar wind much as does the Earth’s field, although on a much smaller scale (Figure 11-14). The solar wind is
a constant flow of charged particles (mostly protons and electrons) away from the outer layers of the Sun’s upper atmosphere.
A planet’s magnetic field can repel and deflect the impinging particles, thereby forming an elongated “cavity” in the solar wind
called a magnetosphere. (We discussed the Earth’s magnetosphere
in Section 9-4.)
Charged-particle detectors aboard Mariner 10 mapped the
structure of Mercury’s magnetosphere. When the particles in the
solar wind first encounter Mercury’s magnetic field, they are
abruptly slowed, producing a shock wave that marks the boundary where this sudden decrease in velocity occurs. Most of the
particles from the solar wind are deflected around the planet, just
as water is deflected to either side of the bow of a ship. Mercury’s
magnetosphere thus prevents the solar wind from reaching the
planet’s surface. Because Mercury’s magnetic field is much weaker
than that of the Earth, it is not able to capture particles from the
solar wind. Hence, it has no structures like the Van Allen belts
that surround the Earth (recall Figure 9-20).

11-4 The first missions to Venus and Mars
demolished decades of speculations about
those planets
Prior to the 1960s, scientists developed a number of intriguing
ideas about Venus and Mars. While these ideas were consistent
with observations made using Earth-based telescopes, they needed
to be radically revised with the advent of spacecraft data.

Close-Up Observations of Venus:
Revealing a Broiled Planet
This scientific controversy was resolved in 1962 when the unmanned U.S. spacecraft Mariner 2 (Figure 11-15) made the first
close flyby of Venus. As we learned in Sections 5-3 and 5-4, a
dense object (like a planet’s surface) emits radiation whose intensity and spectrum depend on the temperature of the object.
Mariner 2 carried instruments that measured radiation coming
from the planet at two microwave wavelengths, 1.35 cm and
1.9 cm. Venus’s atmosphere is transparent to both these wavelengths, so Mariner 2 saw radiation that had been emitted by the

light than Earth because it is closer
to the Sun. If Venus had no atmo- to be steamy and

albedo like that of Mercury or the thought to have
Moon, heating by the Sun would vegetation that varied
bring its surface temperature to with the seasons
around 45°C (113°F)—comparable
to that found in the hottest regions on Earth. What was unclear
until the 1960s was how much effect Venus’s atmosphere has on
the planet’s surface temperature.
We saw in Section 9-1 that gases such as water vapor (H2O)
and carbon dioxide (CO2) in the Earth’s atmosphere trap some of
the infrared radiation that is emitted from our planet’s surface.
This elevates the temperatures of both the atmosphere and its surface, a phenomenon called the greenhouse effect. In 1932, Walter S. Adams and Theodore Dunham Jr. at the Mount Wilson
Observatory found absorption lines of CO2 in the spectrum of
sunlight reflected from Venus, indicating that carbon dioxide is
also present in the Venusian atmosphere. (Section 7-3 describes
how astronomers use spectroscopy to determine the chemical
compositions of atmospheres.) Thus, Venus’s surface, like the
Earth’s, should be warmed by the greenhouse effect.
However, Venus’s perpetual cloud cover reflects back into
space a substantial amount of the solar energy reaching the planet.
This effect by itself acts to cool Venus’s surface, just as clouds in
our atmosphere can make overcast days cooler than sunny days.
Some scientists suspected that this cooling kept the greenhouse effect in check, leaving Venus with surface temperatures below the
boiling point of water. Venus might then have warm oceans and
possibly even life in the form of tropical vegetation. But if the
greenhouse effect were strong enough, surface temperatures could
be so high that any liquid water would boil away. Then Venus
would have a dry, desertlike surface with no oceans, lakes, or rivers.

The Mariner 2 Spacecraft Mariner 2 was the first of all

planet’s surface and then passed through the atmosphere like visible light through glass.
From the amount of radiation that Mariner 2 detected at
these two wavelengths, astronomers concluded that the surface
temperature of Venus was more than 400°C—well above the boiling point of water and higher than even daytime temperatures on
Mercury. Thus, there cannot be any liquid water on the planet’s
surface. Water vapor absorbs microwaves at 1.35 cm, so if there
were substantial amounts of water vapor in Venus’s atmosphere,
it would have blocked this wavelength from reaching the detectors on board Mariner 2. In fact, the spacecraft did detect strong
1.35-cm emissions from Venus. Thus, the atmosphere, too, must
be all but devoid of water.
This picture of Venus as a dry, hellishly hot world was confirmed in 1970 by the Soviet spacecraft Venera 7, which survived
a descent through the Venusian atmosphere and managed to
transmit data for a few seconds directly from the planet’s surface.
Venera 7 and other successful Soviet landers during the early
1970s finally determined the surface temperature to be a nearly
constant 460°C (860°F). Thus, Venus has an extraordinarily
strong greenhouse effect, and the planet’s surface is no one’s idea
of a tropical paradise.

Speculations About Mars: A World With Plant Life
and Canals?
As we saw in Section 11-2, Mars’s axis of rotation is tilted by almost the same angle as the Earth’s axis, and so Mars goes through

270

Chapter 11

seasons much like those on Earth. Observations with Earth-based
telescopes show that the colors of Mars (see Figure 11-4c) vary
with the seasons: During spring and summer in a Martian hemisphere, the polar cap in that hemisphere shrinks and the dark
markings (which sometimes look greenish) become very distinct.
Half a Martian year later, with the approach of fall and winter,
the dark markings fade and the polar cap grows. Could these seasonal variations mean that there is vegetation on Mars that
changes seasonally, just as on the Earth? And if there is plant life
on Mars, might there not also be intelligent beings?
Such speculations were fueled by the Italian astronomer Giovanni Schiaparelli, who observed Mars during the favorable opposition of 1877. He reported that during moments of “good
seeing,” when the air is exceptionally calm and clear, he was able
to see 40 straight-line features crisscrossing the Martian surface
(Figure 11-16). He called these dark linear features canali, an Italian word for “channels,” which was soon mistranslated into English as “canals.” The alleged discovery of canals implied that
there were intelligent creatures on Mars capable of substantial engineering feats. This speculation helped motivate the American
millionaire Percival Lowell to finance a major new observatory
near Flagstaff, Arizona, primarily to study Mars. By the end of

the nineteenth century, Lowell had reported observations of 160
Martian canals.
Although many astronomers observed Mars, not all saw the
canals. In 1894, the American astronomer Edward Barnard, working at Lick Observatory in California, complained that “to save
my soul I can’t believe in the canals as Schiaparelli draws them.”
But objections by Barnard and others did little to sway the proponents of the canals.
As the nineteenth century drew to a close, speculation about
Mars grew more and more fanciful. Perhaps the reddish-brown
color of the planet meant that Mars was a desert world, and perhaps the Martian canals were an enormous planetwide irrigation
network. From these ideas, it was a small leap to envision Mars
as a dying world with canals carrying scarce water from melting
polar caps to farmlands near the equator. The terrible plight of
the Martian race formed the basis of inventive science fiction by
Edgar Rice Burroughs, Ray Bradbury, and many others. It also
led to the notion that the Martians might be a warlike race who
schemed to invade the Earth for its abundant resources. (In Roman mythology, Mars was the god of war.) Stories of alien invasions, from H. G. Wells’s 1898 novel The War of the Worlds
down to the present day, all owe their existence to the canali of
Schiaparelli.

Observations of Mars: Revealing a Windblown,
Cratered World
However, during the first decades of the twentieth century the
Greek astronomer Eugène Antoniadi observed Mars with a stateof-the-art telescope and found that the “canals” were actually unconnected dark spots. There was no evidence whatsoever of linear
canals. Why, then, were Schiaparelli, Lowell, and others so certain that the canals were there? One reason is that their observations were made from the Earth’s surface, at the bottom of an
often turbulent atmosphere that blurs images seen through a telescope. A second reason is that the human eye and brain can
readily be deceived. The brain can connect together two dark
streaks on the Martian surface to give the perception of a single
“canal.” In this way did astronomers such as Schiaparelli and
Lowell delude themselves.
WEB

The other speculation, that Mars was covered with
vegetation, was conclusively ruled out several decades
later. In the 1960s, three American spacecraft flew
past Mars and sent back the first close-up pictures of the planet’s
surface. (Figure 11-17 shows even better images from a subsequent mission to Mars.) These images showed that the dark surface markings are just different-colored terrain.
Why did many Earth-based observers report that dark areas
on Mars had the greenish hue of vegetation? The probable explanation is a quirk of human color vision. When a neutral gray area
is viewed next to a bright red or brown area, the eye perceives the
gray to have a blue-green color.
The seasonal variations in color can be explained by winds
in the Martian atmosphere that blow in different directions in different seasons. These seasonal winds blow fine dust across the
Martian surface, producing planetwide dust storms that can be
seen from Earth (Figure 11-18). The motion of dust covers some
parts of the Martian terrain and exposes others. Thus, Earth observers see large areas of the planet vary from dark to light with

The Mirage of the Martian Canals Giovanni Schiaparelli studied the
Martian surface using a 20-cm (8-in.) telescope, the same size used by
many amateur astronomers today. He recorded his observations in
drawings like this one, which shows a network of linear features that
Percival Lowell and others interpreted as irrigation canals. Later
observations with larger telescopes revealed that the “canals” were mere
illusions. (Michael Hoskin, ed., The Cambridge Illustrated History of Astronomy,

the passage of the seasons, mimicking the color changes that
would be expected from vegetation.
The most remarkable discovery of the missions to Mars in
the 1960s was that the planet’s surface is pockmarked with craters,
as Figure 11-17b and Figure 7-10c show. (Although many of the
Martian craters are quite large, they had escaped detection from
Earth because the thin Martian atmosphere obscures the planet’s
surface somewhat. That is why even Hubble Space Telescope images like Figure 11-17a do not show Martian craters distinctly,
and why it took close-up images made by spacecraft near Mars
to reveal these craters.) During that same decade of the 1960s scientists were learning that most of the craters on the Moon were
formed by interplanetary debris that struck the lunar surface more
than 3 billion years ago. The Martian craters, too, are the result
of long-ago impacts from space. Since so many craters survive to
the present day, at least part of the Martian surface must be extremely ancient (see Section 7-6).
The episode of the Martian canals and Martian vegetation
was not the first time that a number of scientists came to very
wrong conclusions. Like any human activity, science will always
involve human error and human frailties. But scientific investigation is fundamentally self-correcting, because new observations
and experiments can always call into question the scientific theories of the past.

Observing Venus and Mars from Orbit

To make a detailed study of a planet’s surface, a spacecraft that simply flies by the planet will not suffice. Instead, it is necessary to place a spacecraft in orbit
around the planet. Since the 1970s a number of spacecraft have
been placed in Venus orbit and Mars orbit.
In order to map the surface of Venus through the perpetual
cloud layer, several of the Venus orbiters carried radar devices. A
beam of microwave radiation from the orbiter easily penetrates
Venus’s clouds and reflects off the planet’s surface; a receiver on

topographies of both worlds differ in important ways from that

71% of the surface is oceanic crust and about 27% is continental crust that rises above the ocean floors by about 4–6 km on average. On Venus, by contrast, about 60% of the terrain lies within

Magellan, the most recent spacecraft to orbit Venus,
also carried a radar altimeter that bounced microwaves
directly off the ground directly below the spacecraft.
By measuring the time delay of the reflected waves, astronomers
can determine the height and depth of Venus’s terrain.
By contrast, a Mars orbiter can use more conventional telescopes to view the Martian surface through that planet’s thin
atmosphere. Instead of using a radar altimeter to map surface elevations, the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft (which entered
Mars’s orbit in 1997) used a laser beam for the same purpose.

A Topographic Map of Mars This map was generated from

measurements made by the laser altimeter on board the
Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft. As in Figure 11-19, color indicates
elevations above or below the planet’s average radius. Most of the
southern hemisphere lies several kilometers above the northern

500 m of the average elevation, with only a few localized highlands (shown in yellow and red in Figure 11-19). Mars is different from both Earth and Venus: Rather than having continents
scattered among low-lying ocean floors, all of the high terrain on
Mars (shown in red and orange in Figure 11-20) is in the southern hemisphere. Hence, planetary scientists refer to Mars as having northern lowlands and southern highlands. The implication is
that the Martian crust is about 5 km thicker in the southern hemisphere than in the northern hemisphere, a situation called the
crustal dichotomy. In this sense Mars resembles the Moon, which
has a thicker crust on the far side than on the side that faces the
Earth (see Section 10-1).

Tectonics on Venus: A Light, Flaky Crust
Before radar maps like Figure 11-19 were available, scientists
wondered whether Venus had plate tectonics like those that have
remolded the face of the Earth. Venus is only slightly smaller than
the Earth, and should have retained enough heat to sustain a
molten interior and the convection currents that drive tectonic activity on Earth (see Section 9-3, especially Figure 9-16). If this
were the case, then the same tectonic effects might also have
shaped the surface of Venus. As we saw in Section 9-3, the Earth’s
hard outer shell, or lithosphere, is broken into about a dozen
large plates that slowly shuffle across the globe. Long mountain

Hellas Planitia. The landing sites for Viking Landers 1 and 2 (VL1 and

Opportunity) are each marked with an X. (MOLA Science Team, NASA/GSFC)

ranges, like the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (see Figure 9-13), are created
where fresh magma wells up from the Earth’s interior to push the
plates apart.
Radar images from Magellan show no evidence of Earthlike
tectonics on Venus. On Earth, long chains of volcanic mountains
(like the Cascades in North America or the Andes in South America) form along plate boundaries where subduction is taking place.
Mountainous features on Venus, by contrast, do not appear in
chains. There are also no structures like the Earth’s Mid-Atlantic
Ridge, which suggests that there is no seafloor spreading on
Venus. With no subduction or seafloor spreading, there have been
only limited horizontal displacement of Venus’s lithosphere. Thus,
like the Moon (see Section 10-1) and Mercury (see Section 11-3),
Venus is a one-plate planet.
Unlike the Moon, however, Venus has had local, small-scale
deformations and reshaping of the surface. One piece of evidence
for this is that roughly a fifth of Venus’s surface is covered by
folded and faulted ridges. Further evidence comes from close-up
Magellan images that show that Venus has about a thousand
craters larger than a few kilometers in diameter, many more than
have been found on Earth but only a small fraction of the number on the Moon or Mercury. We saw in Section 7-6 that the
number of impact craters is a clue to the age of a planet’s surface.
Such craters formed at a rapid rate during the early history of the
solar system, when considerable interplanetary debris still orbited

R IVUXG

A Partially Obliterated Crater on Venus This Magellan image shows
how the right half of an old impact crater 37 km (20 mi) in diameter was
erased by a fault in the crust. This crater lies in Beta Regio (see the left
side of Figure 11-19). Most features on Venus are named for women in
history and legend; this crater commemorates Emily Greene Balch, an
American economist and sociologist who won the 1946 Nobel Peace
Prize. (NASA/JPL)

the Sun, and have formed at a much slower rate since then. Consequently, the more craters a planet has, the older its surface. The
number of craters on Venus indicates that the Venusian surface is
roughly 500 million years old. This is about twice the age of the
Earth’s surface but much younger than the surfaces of the Moon
or Mercury, each of which is billions of years old. No doubt
Venus was more heavily cratered in its youth, but localized activity in its crust has erased the older craters (Figure 11-21).
Surprisingly, Venus’s craters are uniformly scattered across
the planet’s surface. We would expect that older regions on the
surface—which have been exposed to bombardment for a longer
time—would be more heavily cratered, while younger regions
would be relatively free of craters. For example, the ancient highlands on the Moon are much more heavily cratered than the
younger maria (see Section 10-4). Because such variations are not
found on Venus, scientists conclude that the entire surface of the
planet has essentially the same age. This is very different from the
Earth, where geological formations of widely different ages can
be found.
One model that can explain these features suggests that the
convection currents in Venus’s interior are actually more vigorous
than inside the Earth, but that the Venusian crust is much thinner than the continental crust on Earth. Rather than sliding around
like the plates of the Earth’s crust, the thin Venusian crust stays
in roughly the same place but undergoes wrinkling and flaking
(Figure 11-22). Hence, this model is called flake tectonics. The
Earth, too, may have displayed flake tectonics billions of years
ago when its interior was hotter.

Although Venus almost certainly has molten material
in its interior, it has no planetwide magnetic field. As
we discussed in Section 7-7, this may be because Venus
rotates too slowly to generate the kind of internal motions that
would produce a magnetic field. With no magnetic field, Venus
has no magnetosphere. The planet is nonetheless shielded from
the solar wind by ions in its upper atmosphere.

Tectonics on Mars: A Thick, Rigid Crust
Like Venus, Mars lacks the global network of ridges and subduction zones that plate tectonics has produced on the Earth. Hence,
the entire crust of Mars makes up a single tectonic plate, as is the
case on the Moon, Mercury, and Venus. The explanation is quite
different from that for Venus, however: Because Mars is a much
smaller world than Earth or Venus, the outer layers of the red
planet have cooled more extensively. Thus, Mars lacks plate tectonics because its crust is too thick for one part of the crust to be
subducted beneath another. We see that for a terrestrial planet to
have plate tectonics, the crust must not be too thin (like Venus)
or too thick (like Mars), but just right (like Earth).
This idea has been verified by carefully monitoring the motion of a spacecraft orbiting Mars. If there is a concentration of
mass (such as a thicker crust) at one location on the planet, gravitational attraction will make the spacecraft speed up as it ap-

275

proaches the concentration and slow down as it moves away. A
team of scientists headed by David Smith of NASA’s Goddard
Space Flight Center and Maria Zuber of MIT analyzed the orbit
of Mars Global Surveyor in just this way. They found that unlike
the Earth’s crust, which varies in thickness from 5 to 35 km, the
Martian crust is about 40 km thick under the northern lowlands
but about 70 km thick under the southern highlands. Both regions of the Martian crust are too thick to undergo subduction,
making plate tectonics impossible.
Although there is no plate motion on Mars, there are features
on the planet’s surface that indicate there has been substantial
motion of material in the Martian mantle. The Tharsis rise, visible on the left-hand side of Figure 11-20, is a dome-shaped bulge
that has been lifted 5 to 6 km above the planet’s average elevation. Apparently, a massive plume of magma once welled upward
from a hot spot under this region. East of the Tharsis rise, a vast
chasm runs roughly parallel to the Martian equator (Figure 11-23).
If this canyon were located on Earth, it would stretch from Los
Angeles to New York. In honor of the Mariner 9 spacecraft that
first revealed its presence in 1971, this chasm has been named
Valles Marineris.
Valles Marineris has heavily fractured terrain at its western
end near the Tharsis rise. At its eastern end, by contrast, it is dominated by ancient cratered terrain. Many geologists suspect that
Valles Marineris was caused by the same upwelling of material

that formed the Tharsis rise. As the Martian surface bulged upward at Tharsis, there would have been tremendous stresses on
the crust, which would have caused extensive fracturing. Thus,
Valles Marineris may be a rift valley, a feature created when a
planet’s crust breaks apart along a fault line. Rift valleys are
found on Earth; two examples are the Red Sea (see Figure 9-17)
and the Rhine River valley in Europe. Other, smaller rifts in the
Martian crust are found all around the Tharsis rise. All of these
features are very old, however, and it is thought that there has
been little geologic activity on Mars for billions of years.
Additional evidence that may point to ancient geologic activity on Mars is the crustal dichotomy between the northern lowlands and the southern highlands. The southern highlands are
much more heavily cratered than either Earth or Venus, though
less so than the Moon, while the northern lowlands are remarkably smooth and free of craters. (You can see this difference in
Figure 11-20.) Since most cratering occurred early in the history
of the solar system, this implies that the northern lowlands are
relatively young, while the more heavily cratered southern highlands are relatively old. One proposed explanation is that older
craters in the northern lowlands were erased by tectonic activity
that took place long ago when the Martian crust had not yet
cooled to its present thickness. Other hypotheses are that older
craters could have been erased by a giant asteroid impact or by
lava flows.
A final piece of evidence about ancient Mars is the existence
of locally magnetized areas in the old southern highlands. These
areas presumably solidified during an era in which the interior of
Mars was much hotter, and moving, molten material in the inte-

rior developed a magnetic field. Today, by contrast, Mars has no
planetwide magnetic field. There is probably still molten material
in the core, but the Martian core is thought to contain substantial amounts of sulfur in addition to iron. While temperatures in
the core should be high enough to melt sulfur and sulfur compounds, the electrical properties of these substances are such that
their motions do not generate the electric currents needed to produce a magnetic field.

Volcanoes on Venus and Mars
Radar images of Venus and visible-light images of Mars show
that both planets have a number of large volcanoes (Figure 11-24).
Magellan observed more than 1600 major volcanoes and volcanic
features on Venus, two of which are shown in Figure 11-24a.
Both of these volcanoes have gently sloping sides. A volcano with
this characteristic is called a shield volcano, because in profile it
resembles an ancient Greek warrior’s shield lying on the ground.
Martian volcanoes are less numerous than those on Venus, but
they are also shield volcanoes; the largest of these, Olympus
Mons, is the largest volcano in the solar system (Figure 11-24b).
Olympus Mons rises 24 km (15 mi) above the surrounding plains.
By comparison, the highest volcano on Earth, Mauna Loa in the
Hawaiian Islands, has a summit only 8 km (5 mi) above the ocean
floor.
Most volcanoes on Earth are found near the boundaries of
tectonic plates, where subducted material becomes molten magma
and rises upward to erupt from the surface. This cannot explain
the volcanoes of Venus and Mars, since there are no subduction

Hot-Spot Volcanoes on Earth A hot spot under the Pacific plate has

of these; the oldest, the Emperor Seamount Chain, have eroded so much
that they no longer protrude above the ocean surface.

zones on those planets. Instead, Venusian and Martian volcanoes
probably formed by hot-spot volcanism. In this process, magma
wells upward from a hot spot in a planet’s mantle, elevating the
overlying surface and producing a shield volcano.
On Earth, hot-spot volcanism is the origin of the Hawaiian
Islands. These islands are part of a long chain of shield volcanoes
that formed in the middle of the Pacific tectonic plate as that plate
moved over a long-lived hot spot (Figure 11-25). On Venus and
Mars, by contrast, the absence of plate tectonics means that the
crust remains stationary over a hot spot. On Mars, a single hot
spot under Olympus Mons probably pumped magma upward
through the same vent for millions of years, producing one giant
volcano rather than a long chain of smaller ones. The Tharsis rise
and its volcanoes (see Figure 11-20, Figure 11-23a, and Figure
11-24b) may have formed from the same hot spot as gave rise to
Olympus Mons; a different hot spot on the opposite side of Mars
produced a smaller bulge centered on the volcano Elysium Mons,
shown near the right-hand side in Figure 11-20. The same process
of hot-spot volcanism presumably gave rise to large shield volcanoes on Venus like those shown in Figure 11-24a.

Volcanic Activity on Venus
About 80% of the surface of Venus is composed of flat plains of
volcanic origin. In other words, essentially the entire planet is

277

covered with lava! This observation shows the tremendous importance of volcanic activity in Venusian geology.
To verify the volcanic nature of the Venusian surface, it is
necessary to visit the surface and examine rock samples. Figure
11-26 is a panoramic view taken in 1981 by the Soviet spacecraft
Venera 13, one of 10 unmanned spacecraft that the Soviet Union
landed successfully on the surface of Venus. Russian scientists hypothesize that this region was covered with a thin layer of lava
that fractured upon cooling to create the rounded, interlocking
shapes seen in the photograph. This hypothesis agrees with information obtained from chemical analyses of surface material made
by the spacecraft’s instruments. These analyses indicate that the
surface composition is similar to lava rocks called basalt, which
are common on the Earth (see Figure 9-19a) and in the maria of
the Moon (see Figure 10-13). The results from Venera 13 and
other landers are consistent with the picture of Venus as a world
whose surface and atmosphere have been shaped by volcanic
activity.
Most of the volcanoes on Venus are probably inactive at
present, just as is the case with most volcanoes on Earth. But
Magellan found evidence of recent volcanic activity, some of
which may be continuing today. The key to estimating the amount
of recent volcanic activity is that the radar reflectivity of volcanic
materials depends on whether the material is relatively fresh or
relatively old. By mapping these reflectivity variations on Venus,
Magellan found many areas with young lava flows. Some of the
youngest material found by Magellan caps the volcano Maat
Mons (see Figure 11-24a). Geologists estimate that the topmost
material is no more than 10 million years old and could be much
younger. The presence of such young lava flows suggests that
Venus, like the Earth, has some present-day volcanic activity.
Another piece of evidence for ongoing volcanic activity on
Venus comes from the planet’s atmosphere. An erupting volcano
on Earth, like the one shown in Figure 9-15, ejects substantial
amounts of sulfur dioxide, sulfuric acid, and other sulfur compounds into the air. Many of these substances are highly reactive
and short-lived, forming sulfate compounds that become part of
the planet’s surface rocks. For these substances to be relatively
abundant in a planet’s atmosphere, they must be constantly replenished by new eruptions. Sulfur compounds make up about
0.015% of the Venusian atmosphere, compared to less than
0.0001% of Earth’s atmosphere. This suggests that ongoing volcanic eruptions on Venus are ejecting sulfur compounds into the
atmosphere to sustain the high sulfur content.

Volcanic Activity on Mars
Spectroscopic observations from Mars’s orbit confirm that the
planet’s rocks and sands are made almost entirely of the three
minerals feldspar, pyroxene, and olivine. These are the components of basalt, or solidified lava. Thus, Mars, like Venus, had a
volcanic past.
Unlike lava flows on Venus, however, most of the lava
flows on Mars have impact craters on them. The interpretation
is that most Martian lava flows are very old and that most of
the volcanoes on the red planet are no longer active. This is
what we would expect from a small planet whose crust has
cooled and solidified to a greater depth than on Earth, making

suggests that they are only a few million years old. If volcanoes
erupted on Mars within the past few million years, are they erupting now? Scientists have used infrared telescopes to search for
telltale hot spots on the Martian surface, but have yet to discover
any. Perhaps volcanism on Mars is rare but not yet wholly extinct.
Spacecraft that have landed on Mars have taught us a great
deal about the geology and history of the red planet. Before we
explore the Martian surface in detail, however, it is useful to examine the unique atmospheres of both Mars and Venus.

11-6 The dense atmosphere of Venus
and the thin Martian atmosphere are
dramatically different but have similar
chemical compositions
We have seen that the three large terrestrial planets—Earth, Venus,
and Mars—display very different styles of geology. As we will discover, these differences help to explain why each of these three
worlds has a distinctively different atmosphere.
To explore a planet’s atmosphere it is necessary to send a
spacecraft to make measurements as it descends through that
atmosphere. Both Soviet and American spacecraft have done this

five U.S. spacecraft have successfully landed on Mars. The results of
these missions are summarized in
Figure 11-27, which shows how
pressure and temperature vary with
altitude in the atmospheres of Earth,
Venus, and Mars.

The Venusian Atmosphere: Dense, Hot, and Corrosive
Figure 11-27b depicts just how dense the Venusian atmosphere is.
At the surface, the pressure is 90 atmospheres—that is, 90 times
greater than the average air pressure at sea level on Earth. This is
about the same as the water pressure at a depth of about 1 kilometer below the surface of the Earth’s oceans. The density of the
atmosphere at the surface of Venus is likewise high, more than 50
times greater than the sea-level density of our atmosphere. The
atmosphere is so massive that once heated by the Sun, it retains
its heat throughout the long Venusian night. As a result, temperatures on the day and night sides of Venus are almost identical.
The composition of atmosphere explains why Venus’s surface
temperatures are so high: 96.5% of the molecules in Venus’s
atmosphere are carbon dioxide, with nitrogen (N2) making up
most of the remaining 3.5% (see Table 9-4 for a comparison of
the atmospheres of Venus, Earth, and Mars). Because Venus’s
atmosphere is so thick, and because most of the atmosphere is the

Atmospheres of the Terrestrial Planets In each graph the curve
shows how temperature varies with altitude from 0 to 100 km above the
planet’s surface. The scale on the right-hand side of each graph shows
how pressure varies with altitude. (a) Clouds in the Earth’s atmosphere
are seldom found above 12 km (40,000 ft). (b) Venus’s perpetual cloud

layers lie at much higher altitudes. The atmosphere is so dense that the
pressure 50 km above the Venusian surface is 1 atm, the same as at sea
level on Earth. (c) By contrast, the Martian atmosphere is so thin that the
surface pressure is the same as the pressure at an altitude of 35 km on
Earth. Wispy clouds can be found at extreme altitudes.

greenhouse gas CO2, the greenhouse effect (Section 9-1) has run
wild. On Earth the greenhouse gases H2O and CO2 together
make up only about 1% of our relatively sparse atmosphere, and
the greenhouse effect has elevated the surface temperature by
about 33°C (59°F). But on Venus, the dense shroud of CO2 traps
infrared radiation from the surface so effectively that it has raised
the surface temperature by more than 400°C (720°F).
Soviet and American spacecraft also discovered that Venus’s
clouds are primarily confined to three high-altitude layers. An upper cloud layer lies at altitudes between 68 and 58 km, a denser
and more opaque cloud layer from 58 to 52 km, and an even
more dense and opaque layer between 52 and 48 km. Above and
below the clouds are 20-km-thick layers of haze. Below the lowest haze layer, the atmosphere is remarkably clear all the way
down to the surface of Venus.
We saw in Section 11-5 that sulfur, which is not found in any
appreciable amount in our atmosphere, plays an important role
in the Venusian atmosphere. Sulfur combines with other elements
to form gases such as sulfur dioxide (SO2) and hydrogen sulfide
(H2S), along with sulfuric acid (H2SO4), the same acid used in automobile batteries. While the Earth’s clouds are composed of water droplets, Venusian clouds contain almost no water. Instead,
they are composed of droplets of concentrated, corrosive sulfuric
acid. Thanks to the high temperatures on Venus, these droplets
never rain down on the planet’s surface; they simply evaporate at
high altitude. (You can see a similar effect on Earth. On a hot day
in the desert of the American Southwest, streamers of rain called
virga appear out of the bottoms of clouds but evaporate before
reaching the ground.)

Convection in the Venusian Atmosphere
We saw in Section 9-6 that the Earth’s atmosphere is in continuous motion: Hot gases rise and cooler gases sink, forming convection cells in the atmosphere. The same is true on Venus, but with
some important differences. On Venus, gases in the equatorial regions are warmed by the Sun, then rise upward and travel in the
upper cloud layer toward the cooler polar regions. At the polar
latitudes, the cooled gases sink to the lower cloud layer, in which
they are transported back toward the equator. The result is two
huge convection cells, one in the northern hemisphere and another in the southern hemisphere (Figure 11-28a). These cells are
almost entirely contained within the main cloud layers shown in
Figure 11-27b. The circulation is so effective at transporting heat
around Venus’s atmosphere that there is almost no temperature
difference between the planet’s equator and its poles. By contrast,
the Earth’s atmosphere has a more complicated convection pattern (see Figure 11-28b and Figure 9-24) because the Earth’s
rotation—which is far more rapid than Venus’s—distorts the convection cells.
In addition to the north-south motions due to convection,
high-altitude winds with speeds of 350 km/h (220 mi/h) blow
from east to west, the same direction as Venus’s retrograde rotation. Thus, the upper atmosphere rotates around the planet once
every 4 days. The fast-moving winds stretch out the convection
cells and produce V-shaped, chevronlike patterns in the clouds
(Figure 11-29). In a similar way, the Earth’s rotation stretches out
the convection cells in our atmosphere to produce the complicated circulation patterns shown in Figure 9-24.

On the Earth, friction between the atmosphere and the ground
causes wind speeds at the surface to be much less than at high
altitude. The same is true on Venus: The greatest wind speed
measured by spacecraft on Venus’s surface is only about 5 km/h
(3 mi/h). Thus, only slight breezes disturb the crushing pressures
and infernal temperatures found on Venus’s dry, lifeless surface.

The Martian Atmosphere: Not a Drop to Drink
As Figure 11-27c shows, the atmosphere of Mars is very cold and
thin compared to the atmosphere of either Earth or Venus: The
surface pressure is a mere 0.006 atmosphere. Yet its chemical
composition is very close to that of Venus: The Martian atmosphere is 95.3% carbon dioxide (versus 96.5% for Venus) and
2.7% nitrogen (versus 3.5% for Venus). The predominance of
carbon dioxide means that Mars, like Earth and Venus, is warmed
by the greenhouse effect. However, the Martian atmosphere is so
thin that the greenhouse effect is very weak and warms the Martian surface by only 5°C (versus 33°C on Earth). While the
perpetual cloud cover on Venus maintains a steady surface temperature, the thin atmosphere on Mars provides very little thermal insulation. While daytime highs on Mars can be as high as
20°C (68°F), at night the temperature can plummet to ⫺140°C
(⫺220°F).
Water vapor makes up about 0.03% of the Martian atmosphere (versus about 1% for the Earth), and this vapor can form
clouds. Figure 11-24b shows clouds that form near the tops of
Martian volcanoes when air moves up the volcanic slopes. The
rising air cools until the water vapor condenses into ice crystals.
The same process occurs on Earth, but the clouds that form in
this way are made of droplets of liquid water rather than ice crystals. Why is there a difference?
The explanation is that liquid water cannot exist anywhere
on the Martian surface or in the Martian atmosphere. Water is
liquid over only a limited temperature range: If the temperature
is too low, water becomes ice, and if the temperature is too high,
it becomes water vapor. What determines this temperature range
is the atmospheric pressure above a body of water or around a
water drop. If the pressure is very low, molecules easily escape
from the liquid’s surface, causing the water to vaporize. Thus, at
low pressures, water more easily becomes water vapor. The average surface temperature on Mars is only about 250 K (⫺23°C, or

Mercury, Venus, and Mars: Earthlike yet Unique

⫺10°F), and the average pressure is only 0.006 atmosphere. With
this combination of temperature and pressure, water can exist as
a solid (ice) and as a gas (water vapor) but not as a liquid. (You
can see this same situation inside a freezer, where water vapor
swirls around over ice cubes.) Hence, it never rains on Mars and
there are no bodies of standing water anywhere on the planet.
In order to keep water on Mars in the liquid state, it would
be necessary to increase both the temperature (to keep water from
freezing) and the pressure (to keep the liquid water from evaporating). Later in this chapter we will see evidence that higher temperatures and pressures did exist on Mars billions of years ago,
and that there was once liquid water on the surface.

The Martian Poles: Freezing the Atmosphere
Figure 11-27c shows that at very high altitudes above the Martian surface, atmospheric carbon dioxide can freeze into crystals
and form clouds. (Frozen carbon dioxide can be made on Earth
and is called “dry ice.”) Such frozen carbon dioxide is also found
in larger quantities in ice caps at the north and south poles of
Mars, one of which you can see in Figure 11-4c. Although no
spacecraft has successfully landed on the ice caps, their composition can be measured from orbit by comparing the spectrum sunlight reflected from the ice caps with the known reflection
spectrum of frozen carbon dioxide. (Figure 7-4 shows another application of this idea.)
The size of the ice caps varies substantially with the seasons
(Figure 11-30). When it is winter at one of the Martian poles,
temperatures there are so low that atmospheric carbon dioxide
freezes and the ice cap grows. (Think of it: It gets so cold at the
Martian poles that the atmosphere freezes!) With the coming of
spring, much of the carbon dioxide returns to the gaseous state
and the ice cap shrinks. With the arrival of summer, however, the
rate of shrinkage slows abruptly and a residual ice cap remains

281

solid throughout the summer. Scientists had long suspected that
the north and south residual polar caps contain a large quantity
of frozen water that is less easily evaporated. The European Mars
Express spacecraft confirmed this idea in 2004. It used its infrared cameras to peer through the carbon dioxide layer at the
south polar ice cap and detect the characteristic spectrum of water ice. Because we do not know the thickness of the layer of water ice, the amount of frozen water stored in the Martian polar
caps is still unknown.
The wintertime freezing of atmospheric carbon dioxide was
measured by the Viking Lander 1 and Viking Lander 2 spacecraft, which made the first successful landings on Mars in 1976.
Both of these spacecraft touched down in the northern hemisphere of Mars when it was spring in that hemisphere and autumn in the southern hemisphere. (You can see the landing sites
in Figure 11-20.) Figure 11-31a shows the springtime view from
Viking Lander 1. Initially, both spacecraft measured pressures
around 0.008 atmosphere. After only a few weeks on the Martian surface, however, atmospheric pressure at both landing sites
was dropping steadily. Mars seemed to be rapidly losing its atmosphere, and some scientists joked that soon all the air would be
gone!
The actual explanation was that winter was coming to the
southern hemisphere, causing carbon dioxide to freeze in that
hemisphere’s atmosphere and fall as dry-ice “snow.” The formation of this “snow” removed gas from the Martian atmosphere,
thereby lowering the atmospheric pressure across the planet. Several months later, when spring came to the southern hemisphere,
the dry-ice snow evaporated rapidly and the atmospheric pressure
returned to its prewinter levels. The pressure dropped again in the
southern hemisphere’s summer, because it is then winter in the
northern hemisphere, and dry-ice snow condenses at northern latitudes (Figure 11-31b). Therefore, both temperature and atmospheric pressure change significantly with the Martian seasons.

During the Martian winter, the temperature drops
so low that carbon dioxide freezes out of the
Martian atmosphere. A thin coating of carbon
dioxide frost covers a broad region around Mars’s

carbon dioxide goes back into the atmosphere.
The shrinking of the ice cap exposes a ring of dark
sand dunes around the Martian north pole. (S. Lee/

molecules in our atmosphere scatter blue sunlight more effectively
than other colors (see Box 5-4). On Mars, however, dust particles
in the air do a good job of scattering all visible wavelengths,
which by itself would make the sky appear white. But, in addition, the dust particles contain a mineral called magnetite, which
absorbs blue light. The result is that the Martian sky has a yellowish color reminiscent of butterscotch.

Figure 11-31a shows that the landscape around the
Viking Lander 1 is covered with a fine-grained dust. The
dust particles have piled up in places to form drifts that
resemble sand dunes on Earth. The dust particles are much smaller
than ordinary household dust on Earth: They are only about
1 ␮m (10⫺6 m) across, about the size of the particles in cigarette
smoke. The rocks at the Viking Lander 2 site are also covered
with dust, though it does not pile up in dunes. More recent missions to Mars have also found dust around their landing sites.
Because Martian dust is so fine, it can be carried aloft and
spread over the surface by Martian winds even though the atmosphere is so tenuous. (A wind of 100 km/h, or 60 mi/h, on Mars
is only about as strong as an Earth breeze of 10 km/h or 6 mi/h.)
Windblown dust can sometimes be seen from Earth as a yellow
haze that obscures Martian surface features. Figure 11-18 shows
a dust storm that covered the entire planet, triggered by the flow
of carbon dioxide evaporating from the north polar ice cap with
the coming of northern spring. On Earth, stormy weather means
cloudy skies, wind, and falling rain; on Mars, where no raindrop
falls, stormy weather means wind and dust.
Dust also plays a role in the ordinary daily weather on Mars.
Each afternoon, parcels of warm air rise from the heated surface
and form whirlwinds called dust devils. (A similar phenomenon
with the same name occurs in dry or desert terrain on Earth.)
Martian dust devils can reach an altitude of 6 km (20,000 ft) and
help spread dust particles across the planet’s surface. All three
landers measured changes in air pressure as dust devils swept
past. Often several of these would pass in a single afternoon. Dust
devils are large enough to be seen by spacecraft orbiting Mars
(Figure 11-32). As the sun sets and afternoon turns to evening,
the dust devils subside until the following day.
Airborne dust also affects the color of the Martian sky, shown
in Figure 11-31. The Earth’s largely dust-free sky is blue because

midwinter at the Viking Lander 2 site. Freezing carbon dioxide adheres to
water-ice crystals and dust grains in the atmosphere, causing them to fall
to the ground and coat the surface with frost. This frost lasted for about
a hundred days. (a: Dr. Edwin Bell II/NSSDC/GSFC/NASA; b: NASA/JPL)

Mercury, Venus, and Mars: Earthlike yet Unique

11-7 The atmospheres of Venus and Mars
were very different billions of years ago
Why do Earth, Venus, and Mars have such dramatically different
atmospheres? As we will see, the original atmospheres of all three
worlds were essentially the same.
However, each atmosphere evolved
in a unique way determined by the The early atmospheres
planet’s size and distance from the of Earth, Venus, and
Sun. The Cosmic Connections figure Mars were predominantly
summarizes the processes that led to water vapor and
the present-day atmospheres of the
carbon dioxide
three large terrestrial planets.

The Origin of Atmospheres on Earth, Venus, and Mars
The original atmospheres of Earth, Venus, and Mars all derived
from gases that were emitted, or outgassed, from volcanoes
(Figure 11-33). The gases released by present-day Earth volcanoes
are predominantly water vapor (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), sulfur dioxide (SO2), and nitrogen (N2). These gases should therefore have been important parts of the original atmospheres of all
three planets. Much of the water on all three planets is thought

283

to have come from impacts from comets, icy bodies from the
outer solar system (see Section 7-5 and Section 8-5).
In fact, water probably once dominated the atmospheres of
all three planets. Venus and the Earth are similar in size and mass,
so Venusian volcanoes may well have outgassed as much water
vapor as on the Earth, and both planets would have had about
the same number of comets strike their surfaces. Studies of how
stars evolve suggest that the early Sun was only about 70% as luminous as it is now, so the temperature in Venus’s early atmosphere must have been quite a bit lower. Water vapor may actually
have been able to liquefy and form oceans on Venus. Mars is
smaller than either Earth or Venus, but its large volcanoes could
also have emitted substantial amounts of water vapor. With a
thicker atmosphere and hence greater pressure, liquid water could
also have existed on Mars.

The Evolution of Earth’s Atmosphere
On the present-day Earth most of the water is in the oceans. Nitrogen, which is not very reactive, is still in the atmosphere. By contrast, carbon dioxide dissolves in water, which can fall as rain; as
a result, rain removed most of the H2O and CO2 out of our planet’s
atmosphere long ago. The dissolved CO2 reacted with rocks in
rivers and streams, and the residue was ultimately deposited on the
ocean floors, where it turned into carbonate rocks, such as limestone. Consequently, most of the Earth’s carbon dioxide is tied up
in the Earth’s crust, and only about 1 in every 3000 molecules in
our atmosphere is a CO2 molecule. If the Earth became as hot as
Venus, much of its CO2 would be boiled out of the oceans and
baked out of the crust, and our planet would soon develop a thick,
oppressive carbon dioxide atmosphere much like that of Venus.
The small amount of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere is
sustained in part by plate tectonics. Tectonic activity causes carbonate rocks to cycle through volcanoes, where they are heated
and forced to liberate their trapped CO2. This liberated gas then
rejoins the atmosphere. Without volcanoes, rainfall would remove all of the CO2 from our atmosphere in only a few thousand
years. This would dramatically reduce the greenhouse effect, our
planet’s surface temperature would drop precipitously, and the
oceans would freeze. Plate tectonics is thus essential for maintaining our planet’s livable temperatures.
The oxygen (O2) in our atmosphere is the result of photosynthesis by plant life, which absorbs CO2 and releases O2. The net
result is an atmosphere that is predominantly N2 and O2, with
enough pressure and a high enough temperature (thanks to the
greenhouse effect) for water to remain a liquid—and hence for
life, which requires liquid water, to exist.

A Runaway Greenhouse Effect

RI V UXG

A Volcanic Eruption on Earth The eruption of Mount St. Helens in
Washington state on May 18, 1980 released a plume of ash and gas
40 km (25 mi) high. Eruptions of this kind on Earth, Venus, and Mars
probably gave rise to those planets’ original atmospheres. (USGS)

When Venus was young and had liquid water, the amount of
atmospheric CO2 was kept in check much as on Earth today:
CO2 was released by volcanoes, then dissolved in the oceans and
bound up in carbonate rocks. Enough of the liquid water would
have vaporized to create a thick cover of water vapor clouds.
Since water vapor is a greenhouse gas, this humid atmosphere—
perhaps denser than the Earth’s present-day atmosphere, but far
less dense than the atmosphere that surrounds Venus today—

Earth, Venus, and Mars formed with similar original atmospheres.
However, these atmospheres changed dramatically over time due
to factors such as planetary size and distance from the Sun.

would have efficiently trapped heat from the Sun. At first, this
would have had little effect on the oceans of Venus. Although the
temperature would have climbed above 100°C, the boiling point
of water at sea level on the Earth, the added atmospheric pressure from water vapor would have kept the water in Venus’s
oceans in the liquid state.
This hot and humid state of affairs may have persisted for
several hundred million years. But as the Sun’s energy output
slowly increased over time, the temperature at the surface would
eventually have risen above 374°C (647 K, or 705°F). Above this
temperature, no matter what the atmospheric pressure, Venus’s
oceans would have begun to evaporate. The added water vapor
in the atmosphere would have increased the greenhouse effect,
making the temperature even higher and causing the oceans to
evaporate faster. That would have added even more water vapor
to the atmosphere, further intensifying the greenhouse effect and
making the temperature climb higher still. This is an example of
a runaway greenhouse effect, in which an increase in temperature
causes a further increase in temperature, and so on.

ANALOGY A runaway greenhouse effect is like a house in which
the thermostat has accidentally been connected backward. If the
temperature in such a house gets above the value set on the thermostat, the heater comes on and makes the house even hotter.
Once Venus’s oceans disappeared, so did the mechanism for
removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. With no oceans
to dissolve it, outgassed CO2 began to accumulate in the atmosphere, making the greenhouse effect “run away” even faster.
Temperatures eventually became high enough to “bake out” any
CO2 that was trapped in carbonate rocks. This liberated carbon
dioxide formed the thick atmosphere of present-day Venus.
Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is also a greenhouse gas released by volcanoes. Although present in far smaller amounts than carbon
dioxide, it would have contributed to Venus’s rising temperatures. Like CO2, it dissolves in water, a process that helps moderate the amount of sulfur dioxide in our atmosphere. But when
the oceans evaporated on Venus, the amount of atmospheric SO2
would have increased.
The temperature in Venus’s atmosphere would not have increased indefinitely. In time, solar ultraviolet radiation striking
molecules of water vapor—the dominant cause of the runaway
greenhouse effect—would have broken them into hydrogen and
oxygen atoms. The lightweight hydrogen atoms would have then
escaped into space (see Box 7-2 for a discussion of why lightweight atoms can escape a planet more easily than heavy atoms).
The remaining atoms of oxygen, which is one of the most chemically active elements, would have readily combined with other
substances in Venus’s atmosphere. Eventually, almost all of the
water vapor would have been irretrievably lost from Venus’s
atmosphere. With all the water vapor gone, and essentially all the
carbon dioxide removed from surface rocks, the greenhouse effect
would no longer have “run away,” and the rising temperature
would have leveled off.
Today, the infrared-absorbing properties of CO2 have stabilized Venus’s surface temperature at its present value of 460°C.
Only minuscule amounts of water vapor—about 30 parts per million, or 0.003%—remain in the atmosphere. As on Earth, volcanic

285

outgassing still adds small amounts of water vapor to the atmosphere, along with carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide. But on Venus,
these water molecules either combine with sulfur dioxide to form
sulfuric acid clouds or break apart due to solar ultraviolet radiation.
The great irony is that this state of affairs is the direct result of an
earlier Venusian atmosphere that was predominantly water vapor!

Mars probably had a thicker atmosphere 4 billion years ago.
Thanks to Mars’s greater distance from the Sun and hence less intense sunlight, temperatures would have been lower than on the
young Earth, and any water in the atmosphere would more easily have fallen as rain or snow. This would have washed much of
the planet’s carbon dioxide from its atmosphere, perhaps creating
carbonate minerals in which the CO2 is today chemically bound.
Measurements from Mars orbit show only small amounts of carbonate materials on the surface, suggesting that the amount of
atmospheric CO2 that rained out was small. Hence, even the original Martian atmosphere was relatively thin, though thicker than
the present-day atmosphere.
Because Mars is so small, it cooled early in its history and
volcanic activity came to an end. Thus, any solid carbonates were
not recycled through volcanoes as they are on Earth. The depletion of carbon dioxide from the Martian atmosphere into the surface would therefore have been permanent.
As the amount of atmospheric CO2 declined, the greenhouse
effect on Mars would have weakened and temperatures begun to
fall. This temperature decrease would have caused more water vapor to condense into rain or snow and fall to the surface, taking
even more CO2 with them and further weakening the greenhouse
effect. Thus, a decrease in temperature would have caused a further decrease in temperature—a phenomenon sometimes called a
runaway icehouse effect. (This is the reverse of the runaway greenhouse effect that has taken place on Venus.) Ultimately, both water vapor and most of the carbon dioxide would have been
removed from the Martian atmosphere. With only a very thin
CO2 atmosphere remaining, surface temperatures on Mars eventually stabilized at their present frigid values.
As both water vapor and carbon dioxide became depleted, ultraviolet light from the Sun could penetrate the thinning Martian
atmosphere to strip it of nitrogen. Nitrogen molecules (N2) normally do not have enough thermal energy to escape from Mars,
but they can acquire that energy from ultraviolet photons, which
break the molecules in two. Ultraviolet photons can also split carbon dioxide and water molecules, giving their atoms enough energy to escape (Figure 13-16b). Indeed, in 1971 the Soviet Mars
2 spacecraft found a stream of oxygen and hydrogen atoms (from
the breakup of water molecules) escaping into space. Oxygen
atoms that did not escape into space could have combined with
iron-bearing minerals in the surface, forming rustlike compounds.
Such compounds have a characteristic reddish-brown color and
may be responsible for the overall color of the planet.
Was the early Martian atmosphere thick enough and warm
enough for water to remain as a liquid on the planet’s surface?
As we will see in the next section, scientists have found evidence
on Mars that the answer is a qualified yes.

Landing on Mars

11-8 Rovers have found evidence of ancient
Martian water
Just as ancient fossils on Earth provide evidence of how life has
evolved on our planet, ancient rocks and geological formations
help us understand how our planet’s
surface and atmosphere have Parts of Mars are far
evolved. (For example, the oldest drier than a bone,
rocks on Earth have a chemical
while others had
structure which shows that they
formed in a time when there was lit- standing water for
tle oxygen in the atmosphere and extended periods
hence before the appearance of photosynthetic planet life.) Planetary scientists who want to learn
about the history of Venus and Mars are therefore very interested
in looking at ancient rocks on those worlds.
On Venus we cannot look very far into the past, since the
planet’s volcanic activity and flake tectonics has erased features
more than about 500 million years old (see Section 11-5). On
Mars, by contrast, we expect to find rocks that are billions of
years old: The thin atmosphere causes very little erosion, there
has been little recent volcanic activity to cover ancient rocks, and
there is no subduction to drag old surface features back into the
planet’s interior. (The heavy cratering of the southern highlands
bears testament to the great age of much of the Martian surface.)
In a quest to find these ancient rocks and learn about the early
history of Mars, scientists have sent spacecraft to land on the red
planet and explore it at close range.

As of this writing (2006) five spacecraft have successfully landed
on the Martian surface. Viking Lander 1 and Viking Lander 2,
which we first discussed in Section 11-6, touched down in 1976.
They had no capability to move around on the surface, and so
each Viking Lander could only study objects within reach of the
scoop at the end of its mechanical arm (Figure 11-34a). Figure
11-31 shows the view from the two Viking Lander sites.
Three more recent unmanned explorers, Mars Pathfinder
(landed 1997) and two Mars Exploration Rovers (landed 2004),
were equipped with electrically driven wheels that allow travel
over the surface (Figure 11-34b). Unlike the Viking Landers, these
rovers did not have a heavy and expensive rocket engine to lower
it gently to the Martian surface. Instead, the spacecraft was surrounded by airbags like those used in automobiles. Had there been
anyone to watch Mars Pathfinder or one of the Mars Exploration
Rovers land, they would have seen an oversized beach ball hit the
surface at 50 km/h (30 mi/h), then bounce for a kilometer before
finally rolling to a stop. Unharmed by its wild ride, the spacecraft
then deflated its airbags and began to study the geology of Mars.
Figure 11-20 shows the landing sites of the Mars Pathfinder
rover (named Sojourner) and the two Mars Exploration Rovers
(named Spirit and Opportunity). Following directions from Earth,
Sojourner spent three months exploring the rocks around its landing site. The Mars Exploration Rovers were also designed for a
three-month lifetime, but both were still functioning more than
21⁄2 years after landing. Over that time Spirit and Opportunity
had each traveled several kilometers over the Martian surface.

Mercury, Venus, and Mars: Earthlike yet Unique

In addition to cameras, all five landers carried a device called
an X-ray spectrometer to measure the chemical composition of
rock samples. Spirit and Opportunity also carried a tool designed
to grind holes into rocks, thus revealing parts of the rock’s interior that have not been weathered by exposure to the Martian
atmosphere.

The Martian Regolith
The Viking Landers were the first to reveal the nature of the Martian regolith, or surface material. The scoop on the extendable
arm (Figure 11-34a) was used to dig into the regolith and retrieve
samples for analysis. Bits of the regolith clung to a magnet
mounted on the scoop, indicating that the regolith contains iron.
The X-ray spectrometers showed that samples collected at both
Viking Lander sites were rich in iron, silicon, and sulfur.
The Viking Landers each carried a miniature chemistry laboratory for analyzing the regolith. Curiously, when a small amount
of water was added to a sample of regolith, the sample began to
fizz and release oxygen. This experiment indicated that the regolith contains unstable chemicals called peroxides and superoxides, which break down in the presence of water to release oxygen gas.
The unstable chemistry of the Martian regolith probably
comes from solar ultraviolet radiation that beats down on the
planet’s surface. (Unlike Earth, Mars has no ozone layer to screen
out ultraviolet light.) Ultraviolet photons easily break apart molecules of carbon dioxide (CO2) and water vapor (H2O) by knocking off oxygen atoms, which then become loosely attached to
chemicals in the regolith. Ultraviolet photons also produce highly
reactive ozone (O3) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), which also
become incorporated in the regolith.

287

Among the most important scientific goals of the Viking Landers was to search for evidence of life on Mars. Although it was
clear that Mars has neither civilizations nor vast fields of plants,
it still seemed possible that simple microorganisms could have
evolved on Mars during its early brief epoch of Earthlike climate.
If so, perhaps some species had survived to the present day. To
test this idea, the Viking Landers looked for biologically significant chemical reactions in samples of the Martian regolith, but
they failed to detect any reactions of this type. Perhaps life never
existed on Mars, or perhaps it existed once but was destroyed by
the presence of peroxides and superoxides in the regolith.
On Earth, hydrogen peroxide is commonly used as an antiseptic. When poured on a wound, it fizzes and froths as it reacts
with organic material and destroys germs. Thus, the Viking Landers may have failed to detect any biochemistry on Mars because
the regolith has literally been sterilized! Hence, we cannot yet tell
whether life ever existed on Mars, or whether it might yet exist
elsewhere on or beneath the planet’s surface. (In Chapter 28 we
discuss the Viking Lander experiments in detail, as well as the
controversial proposal that fossil Martian microorganisms may
have traveled to Earth aboard meteorites.)

Exploring Martian Rocks
Images made from Mars orbit show a number of features that
suggest water flowed there in the past (Figure 11-35). To investigate these, Mars Pathfinder landed in an area of the northern
lowlands called Ares Valles, which appears to be an ancient flood
plain. Figure 11-35b shows a portion of this plain. Flood waters
can carry rocks of all kinds great distances from their original locations, so scientists expected that this landing site (Figure 11-36)
would show great geologic diversity. They were not disappointed.

Many of the rocks appeared to be igneous rock produced by volcanic action. Other rocks, which resemble the impact breccias
found in the ancient highlands of the Moon (see Figure 10-15),
appear to have come from areas that were struck by craterforming meteoroids. Still others have a layered structure like sedimentary rocks on Earth (see Figure 9-19b). Such rocks form

(a) Volcanic rocks

Figure 11-37

The two Mars Exploration Rovers also landed in sites that were
suspected to have been under water in the distant past. Spirit
touched down in Gusev Crater, a large impact basin. A valley
opens into this crater, resembling a river that runs into a lake. The
destination for Opportunity was the flat plain of Sinus Meridianii, where orbiting spectrometers had spotted evidence of
hematite—a type of iron oxide that, on Earth, tends to form in
wet locations.
Contrary to expectations, most of the rocks encountered by
Spirit show no evidence that they have been exposed to water.
The volcanic rocks found in and around Gusev Crater (Figure
11-37a) are composed of the minerals olivine and pyroxene,
which break down if they are exposed to liquid water. In a few
locations Spirit found deposits of sulfur salts, which can be formed
by the action of water (Figure 11-37b). However, olivine and pyroxene were still found among the sulfur salts. While it remains
a possibility that Gusev Crater was once a river-fed lake, the results from Spirit show that for the past billion years this region has
been drier than any desert on Earth.
The results from Opportunity were entirely different. This
rover discovered outcrops of sedimentary rocks on the plains of
Sinus Meridianii (Figure 11-38). These rocks are heavily laden
with sulfur compounds, strongly suggesting that they were produced by the evaporation of sulfur-rich water. Opportunity also
found millimeter-sized spheres of hematite that, like analogous
spheres found on Earth, probably formed from iron-rich water
circulating through sediment. These observations suggest Sinus

nuclei of atoms in the soil and knock out neutrons. (Recall from
Section 5-7 that atomic nuclei contain both positively charged
protons and electrically neutral neutrons.) If the ejected neutrons
originate within a meter or so of the surface, they can penetrate
through the regolith and escape into space. However, if there are
water molecules (H2O) in the surface, the nuclei of the hydrogen
atoms in these molecules will absorb the neutrons and prevent
them from escaping. An instrument on board Mars Odyssey detects neutrons coming from Mars; where the instrument finds a
deficiency of neutrons is where the soil contains hydrogen and,
presumably, water.
The results from the Mars Odyssey neutron measurements
show that there is abundant water beneath the surface at both
Martian poles (Figure 11-39). But they also show a surprising
amount of subsurface water in two regions near the equator, Arabia Terra (see Figure 11-17a and Figure 11-20) and another region on the opposite side of the planet. One possible explanation
is that about a million years ago, gravitational forces from other
planets caused a temporary change in the tilt of Mars’s rotation
axis. The ice caps were then exposed to more direct sunlight,
causing some of the water to evaporate and eventually refreeze
elsewhere on the planet.

Meridianii, which is among the flattest places known in the solar
system, was once a lake bed. It is not known how long ago this
area was under water, but the density of craters found there suggests that the surface formed 3 to 4 billion years ago.
When combined with observations from Mars orbit, the Spirit
and Opportunity results show that ancient Mars was a very diverse planet. Most of the planet was probably very dry, like
Gusev Crater, but there were isolated areas like Sinus Meridianii
that had liquid water for some period of time. It remains a challenge to planetary scientists to explain why liquid water appeared
on Mars only in certain places and at certain times.

Where Is the Water Now?
Whatever liquid water once coursed over parts of the Martian
surface is presumably now frozen, either at the polar ice caps or
beneath the planet’s surface. To check this idea, scientists used a
device on board the Mars Odyssey orbiter to measure the result
of cosmic rays hitting Mars.
Cosmic rays are fast-moving subatomic particles that enter
our solar system from interstellar space. When these particles
strike and penetrate into the Martian soil, they collide with the

Martian Gullies When the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft looked
straight down into this crater in the Martian southern hemisphere, it saw
a series of gullies along the crater wall. These gullies may have formed by
subsurface water seeping out to the surface, or by the melting of snow
that fell on crater walls. (NASA/JPL/Malin Space Science Systems)

11-9 The two Martian moons

LINK 11

Two moons move around Mars in orbits close to the
planet’s surface. These satellites are so tiny that they
were not discovered until the favorable opposition of
1877. While Schiaparelli was seeing canals, the American astronomer Asaph Hall spotted the two moons, which orbit almost
directly above its equator. He named them Phobos (“fear”) and
Deimos (“panic”), after the mythical horses that drew the chariot of the Greek god of war.
.18

There are other surprising features on Mars related to the
presence of water. A number of Mars Global Surveyor images
show gullies apparently carved by water flowing down the walls
of pits or craters (Figure 11-40). These could have formed when
water trapped underground—where the pressure is greater and
water can remain a liquid—seeped onto the surface. The gullies
appear to be geologically young, so it is possible that even today
some liquid water survives below the Martian surface. Alternatively, these gullies may have formed during periods when the
Martian climate was colder than usual and the slopes of craters
were covered with a layer of dust and snow. Melting snow on the
underside of this layer could have carved out gullies, which were
later exposed when the climate warmed and the snow evaporated.
The total amount of water on Mars is not known. But by examining flood channels at various locations around Mars, Michael
Carr of the U.S. Geological Survey has estimated that there is
enough water to cover the planet to a depth of 500 meters
(1500 ft). (By comparison, Earth has enough water to cover our
planet to a depth of 2700 meters, or 8900 ft.) Thus, while the total amount of water on Mars is less than on Earth, there may be
enough to have once formed lakes or seas—one of which may
have covered the plains of Sinus Meridianii and produced the sedimentary rocks shown in Figure 11-38. Future missions to Mars
will delve more deeply into the past climate and geology of the
red planet.

The Orbits of Phobos and Deimos
Phobos is the inner and larger of the Martian moons. It circles
Mars in just 7 hours and 39 minutes at an average distance of
only 9378 km (5828 mi) from the
center of Mars. (Recall that our As seen from Mars,
Moon orbits at an average distance
Deimos rises in the
of 384,400 km from the Earth’s center.) This orbital period is much east but Phobos rises in
shorter than the Martian day; hence, the west
Phobos rises in the west and gallops
across the sky in only 51⁄2 hours, as viewed by an observer near
the Martian equator. During this time, Phobos appears several
times brighter in the Martian sky than Venus does from the Earth.
Deimos, which is farther from Mars and somewhat smaller
than Phobos, appears about as bright from Mars as Venus
does from the Earth. Deimos orbits at an average distance of
23,460 km (14,580 mi) from the center of Mars, slightly beyond
the right distance for a synchronous orbit—an orbit in which a
satellite seems to hover above a single location on the planet’s
equator. As seen from the Martian surface, Deimos rises in the
east and takes about 3 full days to creep slowly from one horizon to the other. (Figure 11-41a).
Images from spacecraft in Mars’s orbit reveal Phobos and
Deimos to be jagged and heavily cratered (Figure 11-41b). Both
moons are somewhat elongated from a spherical shape: Phobos is
approximately 28 by 23 by 20 km in size, while Deimos is slightly
smaller, roughly 16 by 12 by 10 km. Observations from the
Viking Orbiters showed that Phobos and Deimos are both in synchronous rotation. The tidal forces that Mars exerts on these
elongated moons cause them to always keep the same sides toward Mars, just as the Earth’s tidal forces ensure that the same
side of the Moon always faces us (see Section 4-8).
We saw in Section 10-5 that the Moon raises a tidal bulge on
the Earth. Because the Earth rotates on its axis more rapidly than
the Moon orbits the Earth, this bulge is dragged ahead of a line
connecting the Earth and Moon (see Figure 10-17). The gravitational force of this bulge pulls the Moon into an ever larger orbit. In the same way, and for the same reason, Deimos is slowly
moving away from Mars. But for fast-moving Phobos, the situation is reversed: Mars rotates on its axis more slowly than Phobos moves around Mars. This slow rotation holds back the tidal
bulge that Phobos raises in the solid body of Mars, and this bulge
thus is behind a line connecting the centers of Mars and Phobos.
(Imagine that the bulge in Figure 10-17 is tilted clockwise rather
than counterclockwise.) This bulge exerts a gravitational force on

Phobos that pulls it back, slowing the moon’s motion and making it slowly spiral inward toward Mars. This inward spiral will
cease in about 40 million years when Phobos smashes into the
Martian surface.

The Nature of the Martian Moons
The origin of the Martian moons is unknown. One idea is that
they are asteroids that Mars captured from the nearby asteroid
belt (see Section 7-5). Like Phobos and Deimos, many asteroids
reflect very little sunlight (typically less than 10%) because of a
high carbon content. Phobos and Deimos also have very low densities (1900 kg/m3 and 1760 kg/m3, respectively), which are also
characteristic of carbon-rich asteroids. Perhaps two of these asteroids wandered close enough to Mars to become permanently
trapped by the planet’s gravitational field. Alternatively, Phobos
and Deimos may have formed in orbit around Mars out of debris
left over from the formation of the planets. Some of this debris
might have come from the asteroid belt, giving these two moons
an asteroidlike character. Future measurements of the composition of the Martian moons—perhaps by landing spacecraft on
their surfaces—may shed light on their origin.

Future Exploration of Mars
The exploration of Mars and its two moons has really just begun. Recent discoveries from orbiters and landers have only
whetted our appetite to know more about Mars. Fortunately,
every 25 months the Earth and Mars are ideally placed for sending a spacecraft from one planet to another with the minimum
thrust. For the next several years, one or more spacecraft will be
launched toward Mars at each of these opportunities. One of
these spacecraft may land on Mars, collect samples with an advanced rover, and return those samples to Earth. Detailed analy-

the top of the image of Deimos is actually a side view of an impact crater
10 km across, comparable to the Moon’s 22-km average diameter. An
only slightly more powerful impact would have broken Deimos apart.

sis of Martian samples in laboratories on Earth could answer
many open questions about the red planet, its formation, and its
evolution.
It is ironic that at the end of the nineteenth century, the English novelist H. G. Wells envisioned a fleet of Martian spaceships
coming to Earth on a mission of conquest. In the twenty-first century, it is we on Earth who are sending robotic spacecraft on a
peaceful scientific “invasion” of Mars.

292

Chapter 11

• At their greatest eastern and western elongations, Mercury is
only 28° from the Sun and Venus is only 47° from the Sun.
• The best Earth-based views of Mars are obtained at favorable
oppositions, when Mars is simultaneously at opposition and near
perihelion.
Rotation of Mercury, Venus, and Mars: Poor telescopic views of
Mercury’s surface led to the mistaken impression that the planet
always keeps the same face toward the Sun (1-to-1 spin-orbit
coupling).
• Radio and radar observations revealed that Mercury in fact has
3-to-2 spin-orbit coupling: The planet rotates on its axis three
times every two orbits.
• Venus rotates slowly in a retrograde direction. Its rotation period is longer than its orbital period.
• Mars rotates at almost the same rate as the Earth, and its rotation axis is tilted by almost the same angle as the Earth’s axis.
Mercury’s Surface, Interior, and Magnetic Field: The Mercurian
surface is pocked with craters, but there are extensive smooth
plains between these craters.
• Long cliffs called scarps meander across the surface of Mercury.
These probably formed as the planet’s crust cooled, solidified,
and shrank.
• Mercury has an iron core with a diameter equal to about 3⁄4 of
the planet’s diameter. By contrast, the diameter of the Earth’s
core is only slightly more than 1⁄2 of Earth’s diameter.
• Mercury has a weak magnetic field, which indicates that at least
part of the iron core is liquid.
Comparing Venus and Mars: Most of the surface of Venus is at
about the same elevation, with just a few elevated regions. On
Mars, the southern highlands rise several kilometers above the
northern lowlands.
• Venus has a thick atmosphere and a volcanically active surface.
Mars has a very thin atmosphere and little or no current volcanism.
• There is no evidence of plate tectonics on either Venus or Mars.
On Venus, there is vigorous convection in the planet’s interior,
but the crust is too thin to move around in plates; instead, it wrinkles and flakes. On Mars, the planet’s smaller size means the crust
has cooled and become too thick to undergo subduction.
• Volcanoes on both Venus and Mars were produced by hot spots
in the planet’s interior.
• The entire Venusian surface is about 500 million years old and
has relatively few craters. By contrast, most of the Martian surface is cratered and is probably billions of years old. The southern highlands on Mars are the most heavily cratered and hence
the oldest part off the planet’s surface.
The Atmospheres of Venus and Mars: Both planetary atmospheres
are over 95% carbon dioxide, with a few percent of nitrogen.
• The pressure at the surface of Venus is about 90 atmospheres.
The greenhouse effect is very strong, which raises the surface temperature to 460°C. The pressure at the surface of Mars is only
0.006 atmosphere, and the greenhouse effect is very weak.

• The permanent high-altitude clouds on Venus are made primarily of sulfuric acid. By contrast, the few clouds in the Martian
atmosphere are composed of water ice and carbon dioxide ice.
• The circulation of the Venusian atmosphere is dominated by
two huge convection currents in the cloud layers, one in the northern hemisphere and one in the southern hemisphere. The upper
cloud layers of the Venusian atmosphere move rapidly around the
planet in a retrograde direction, with a period of only about 4
Earth days.
• Weather on Mars is dominated by the north and south flow of
carbon dioxide from pole to pole with the changing seasons. This
can trigger planetwide dust storms.
Evolution of Atmospheres: Earth, Venus and Mars all began with
relatively thick atmospheres of carbon dioxide, water vapor, and
sulfur dioxide.
• On Earth, most of the carbon dioxide went into carbonate
rocks and most of the water into the oceans. Ongoing plate tectonics recycles atmospheric gases through the crust.
• On Venus, more intense sunlight and the absence of plate tectonics led to a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere and a runaway
greenhouse effect.
• On Mars, a runaway icehouse effect resulted from weaker sunlight and the absence of plate tectonics.
Water on Mars: Liquid water cannot exist on present-day Mars
because the atmosphere is too thin and cold. But there is evidence
for frozen water at the polar ice caps and beneath the surface of
the regolith.
• Geological evidence from unmanned rovers shows that much of
the Martian surface has been dry for billions of years, but some
regions had substantial amounts of water.
The Moons of Mars: Mars has two small, football-shaped satellites that move in orbits close to the surface of the planet. They
may be captured asteroids or may have formed in orbit around
Mars out of solar system debris.

Advanced Questions
Problem-solving tips and tools
We discussed the relationship between angular distance and
linear distance in Box 1-1 and the idea of angular resolution
in Section 6-3. You may need to refresh your memory about
Kepler’s third law, described in Section 4-4. You may also
need to review the form of Kepler’s third law that explicitly
includes mass (see Section 4-7 and Box 4-4). Box 4-1 describes the relationship between a planet’s sidereal orbital period and its synodic period (the time from one inferior
conjunction to the next). You should recall that Wien’s law
(Section 5-4) relates the temperature of a blackbody to ␭max,
its wavelength of maximum emission. Section 5-9 and Box
5-6 explain the Doppler effect and how to do calculations using it. The linear speed of a point on a planet’s equator is the
planet’s circumference divided by its rotation period; Recall
that the circumference of a circle of radius r is 2␲r. The volume of a sphere of radius r is 4␲r3/3. The speed of light is
given in Appendix 7.

41. Figure 11-1 shows Mercury with a greatest eastern elongation of 18° and a greatest western elongation of 28°. On
November 25, 2006, Mercury was at a greatest western elongation of 20°. Was Mercury at perihelion, aphelion, or some
other point on its orbit? Explain.
42. Venus takes 440 days to move from greatest western elongation to greatest eastern elongation, but it needs only 144 days
to go from greatest eastern elongation to greatest western
elongation. With the aid of a diagram like Figure 11-1, explain why.
43. Venus’s sidereal rotation period is 243.01 days and its orbital
period is 224.70 days. Use these data to prove that a solar
day on Venus lasts 116.8 days. (Hint: Develop a formula relating Venus’s solar day to its sidereal rotation period and orbital period similar to the first formula in Box 4-1.)
44. In Section 11-2 we described the relationship between the
length of Venus’s synodic period and the length of an apparent solar day on Venus. Using this and a diagram, explain
why at each inferior conjunction the same side of Venus is
turned toward the Earth.
45. This time-lapse photograph was taken on May 7, 2003, during a solar transit of Mercury. Over a period of 5 hours and
19 minutes, Mercury appeared to move across the face of the
Sun. Such solar transits of Mercury occur 13 or 14 times each
century; they do not happen each time that Mercury is at inferior conjunction. Explain why not. (Hint: For a solar transit to occur, the Sun, Mercury, and the Earth must be in a
nearly perfect alignment. Does the orbit of Mercury lie in the
plane of the ecliptic?)

46. Find the largest angular size that Mercury can have as seen
from the Earth. In order for Mercury to have this apparent
size, at what point in its orbit must it be?
47. (a) Suppose you have a telescope with an angular resolution
of 1 arcsec. What is the size (in kilometers) of the smallest
feature you could have seen on the Martian surface during
the opposition of 2005, when Mars was 0.464 AU from

56.

57.

Earth? (b) Suppose you had access to the Hubble Space
Telescope, which has an angular resolution of 0.1 arcsec.
What is the size (in kilometers) of the smallest feature you
could have seen on Mars with the HST during the 2005
opposition?
For a planet to appear to the naked eye as a disk rather than
as a point of light, its angular size would have to be 1 arcmin,
or 60 arcsec. (This is the same as the angular separation between lines in the bottom row of an optometrist’s eye chart.)
(a) How close would you have to be to Mars in order to see
it as a disk with the naked eye? Does Mars ever get this close
to Earth? (b) Would the Earth ever be visible as a disk to an
astronaut on Mars? Would she be able to see the Earth and
the Moon separately, or would they always appear as a single object? Explain.
Using Figure 11-3, explain why oppositions of Mars are most
favorable when they occur in August.
Imagine that you are part of the scientific team monitoring a
spacecraft that has landed on Mars. At 5:00 P.M. in your control room on Earth, the spacecraft reports that the Sun is
highest in the sky as seen from its location on Mars. When
the Sun is next at its highest point as seen from the spacecraft, what time will it be in the control room on Earth?
(a) Mercury has a 58.646-day rotation period. What is the
speed at which a point on the planet’s equator moves due to
this rotation? (Hint: Remember that speed is distance divided
by time. What distance does a point on Mercury’s equator
travel as the planet makes one rotation?) (b) Use your answer
to (a) to answer the following: As a result of rotation, what
difference in wavelength is observed for a radio wave of
wavelength 12.5 cm (such as is actually used in radar studies
of Mercury) emitted from either the approaching or receding
edge of the planet?
The orbital period of Mariner 10 is twice that of Mercury.
Use this fact to calculate the length of the semimajor axis of
the spacecraft’s orbit.
Much of the area shown in Figure 11-10 is pockmarked with
small impact craters. By contrast, there are very few small
craters within the large crater at the upper right of this figure.
Explain why this suggests that the interior of this crater was
flooded with lava while the area outside the crater was not.
Consider the idea that Mercury has a solid iron-bearing mantle that is permanently magnetized like a giant bar magnet.
Using the fact that iron demagnetizes at temperatures above
770°C, present an argument against this explanation of Mercury’s magnetic field.
(a) At what wavelength does Venus’s surface emit the most
radiation? (b) Do astronomers have telescopes that can detect
this radiation? (c) Why can’t we use such telescopes to view
the planet’s surface?
The Mariner 2 spacecraft detected more microwave radiation
when its instruments looked at the center of Venus’s disk
than when it looked at the edge, or limb, of the planet. (This
effect is called limb darkening.) Explain how these observations show that the microwaves are emitted by the planet’s
surface rather than its atmosphere.

tinuous rainfall except for one day every few years when the
clouds part and the Sun comes out for an hour or so. Discuss
how our understanding of Venus’s atmosphere has evolved
since this story was first published in 1954.
Suppose that Venus had no atmosphere at all. How would
the albedo of Venus then compare with that of Mercury or
the Moon? Explain your answer.
A hypothetical planet has an atmosphere that is opaque to
visible light but transparent to infrared radiation. How would
this affect the planet’s surface temperature? Contrast and
compare this hypothetical planet’s atmosphere with the greenhouse effect in Venus’s atmosphere.
The Earth’s northern hemisphere is 39% land and 61% water, while its southern hemisphere is only 19% land and 81%
water. Thus, the southern hemisphere could also be called the
“water hemisphere.” The Moon also has two distinct hemispheres, the near side (which has a number of maria) and the
far side (which has almost none). How are these hemispheric
differences on Earth and on the Moon similar to the Martian
crustal dichotomy? How are they different?
For a group of properly attired astronauts equipped with
oxygen tanks, a climb to the summit of Olympus Mons would
actually be a relatively easy (albeit long) hike rather than a
true mountain climb. Give two reasons why.
On Mars, the difference in elevation between the highest
point (the summit of Olympus Mons) and the lowest point
(the bottom of the Hellas Planitia basin) is 30 km. On Earth,
the corresponding elevation difference (from the peak of
Mount Everest to the bottom of the deepest ocean) is only
20 km. Discuss why the maximum elevation difference is so
much greater on Mars.
The Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) spacecraft is in a nearly
circular orbit around Mars with an orbital period of 117
minutes. (a) Using the data in Table 11-3, find the radius of
the orbit. (b) What is the average altitude of MGS above the
Martian surface? (c) The orbit of MGS passes over the north
and south poles of Mars. Explain how this makes it possible
for the spacecraft to observe the entire surface of the planet.
The elevations in Figure 11-20 were measured using an instrument called MOLA (Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter) on
board Mars Global Surveyor. MOLA fires a laser beam downward, then measures how long it takes for the beam to return
to the spacecraft after reflecting off the surface. Suppose
MOLA measures this round-trip time for the laser beam to
reflect off the summit of Olympus Mons, as well as the roundtrip time to reflect off the bottom of Hellas Planitia (see
Question 61). Which round-trip time is longer? How much
longer is it? Do you need to know the distance from Mars
Global Surveyor to the surface to answer this question?
(a) The Grand Canyon in Arizona was formed over 15 to 20
million years by the flowing waters of the Colorado River, as
well as by rain and wind. Contrast this formation scenario to
that of Valles Marineris on Mars. (b) Valles Marineris is
sometimes called “the Grand Canyon of Mars.” Is this an appropriate description? Why or why not?
Water has a density of 1000 kg/m3, so a column of water n

atmospheric pressure on Venus’s surface, 90 atm or 9 ⫻ 106
newtons per square meter. Give your answer in meters.
Marine organisms produce sulfur-bearing compounds, some
of which escape from the oceans into the Earth’s atmosphere.
(These compounds are largely responsible for the characteristic smell of the sea.) Even more sulfurous gases are injected
into our atmosphere by the burning of sulfur-rich fossil fuels,
such as coal, in electric power plants. Both of these processes
add more sulfur compounds to the atmosphere than do volcanic eruptions. On lifeless Venus, by contrast, volcanoes are
the only source for sulfurous atmospheric gases. Why, then,
are sulfur compounds so much rarer in our atmosphere than
in the Venusian atmosphere?
The classic 1950 science-fiction movie Rocketship X-M shows
astronauts on the Martian surface with oxygen masks for
breathing but wearing ordinary clothing. Would this be a
sensible choice of apparel for a walk on Mars? Why or why
not?
Suppose that the only information you had about Mars was
the images of the surface in Figure 11-31. Describe at least
two ways that you could tell from these images that Mars has
an atmosphere.
Although the Viking Lander 1 and Viking Lander 2 landing
sites are 6500 km apart and have different geologic histories,
the chemical compositions of the dust at both sites are nearly
identical. (a) What does this suggest about the ability of the
Martian winds to transport dust particles? (b) Would you expect that larger particles such as pebbles would also have
identical chemical compositions at the two Viking Lander
sites? Why or why not?
Why do you suppose that Phobos and Deimos are not round
like our Moon?
The orbit of Phobos has a semimajor axis of 9378 km. Use
this information and the orbital period given in the text to
calculate the mass of Mars. How does your answer compare
with the mass of Mars given in Table 11-3?
Calculate the angular sizes of Phobos and Deimos as they
pass overhead, as seen by an observer standing on the Martian equator. How do these sizes compare with that of the
Moon seen from the Earth’s surface? Would Phobos and
Deimos appear as impressive in the Martian sky as the Moon
does in our sky?
You are to put a spacecraft into a synchronous circular orbit
around the Martian equator, so that its orbital period is equal
to the planet’s rotation period. Such a spacecraft would always be over the same part of the Martian surface. (a) Find
the radius of the orbit and the altitude of the spacecraft above
the Martian surface. (b) Suppose Mars had a third moon that
was in a synchronous orbit. Would tidal forces make this
moon tend to move toward Mars, away from Mars, or neither? Explain.

umans are explorers by nature. The great quests of human history have presented grand challenges that by
necessity have inspired creative design of ships of
exploration. In the search to understand the history of water
on Mars, and its potential role in enabling the evolution of life
on the most Earthlike terrestrial planet, human imagination
has been no less bridled. Since humans cannot yet travel to
other planets, we have developed robots that can survive interplanetary travel and the harsh surface conditions on other
planets. These robotic explorers are designed to act as geologists, which was the case for the 2004 Mars Exploration Rover
mission.
In June 2003, two golf cart–sized rovers destined to land
on the Martian surface were launched from Cape Canaveral,
Florida, and began their 300-million-kilometer journey to the
Red Planet. This mission succeeded beyond anyone’s expectations, making 2004, 2005, and 2006 three of the greatest years
in the history of space exploration. The Mars Exploration
Rovers—Spirit and Opportunity—were designed to survive
3 months under the hostile Martian surface conditions and
drive no farther than 300 m. Remarkably, at the time this article was written, each rover has operated for more than two
and a half years, and driven a combined distance of more than
15 km! The rovers have had to survive nighttime temperatures
below –150 °C, dust devils that could have tipped them over,
global dust storms that diminished their solar power, and
drives along rocky slopes of almost 30° and through piles of

John Grotzinger is a field geologist interested in the
evolution of Earth’s surficial environments and
biosphere. He received a B.S. in geoscience from Hobart
College in 1979, an M.S. in geology from University of Montana in
1981, and a Ph.D. in geology from Virginia Tech in 1985. He
currently works as a geologist on the Mars Exploration Rover team.
This mission is the first to conduct ground-based exploration of
the bedrock geology of another planet, resulting in the discovery
of sedimentary rocks formed in aqueous depositional
environments.

treacherous windblown sand and dust. The rovers have also
discovered a treasure trove of geologic wonders. These discoveries include compelling evidence for water on the ancient
Martian surface—a necessary condition for life, at least as it
exists on Earth, and can be contemplated for Mars.
In particular, the rover Opportunity has discovered evidence from the Meridiani Planum area that water may have
pooled in shallow lakes, known as playas, and infiltrated pores
in sediments and soils to cause aqueous alteration. So we now
know that water was present in the shallow subsurface environment and was at least intermittently present at the surface
as shallow lakes and streams. But the evidence for water alone
is not enough to demonstrate that life may have existed. One
must also ask if the water would have had physical attributes
that would have allowed life to develop.
Mars today is a forbidding place. Temperature and atmospheric pressure are so low that liquid water is not stable on
the present-day Martian surface. The surface is also chemically
harsh and subject to strong radiation. It is doubtful that organisms thrive today at the Martian surface. Opportunity’s discoveries indicate that surface environments may have,
unfortunately, been biologically challenging for most of Mars’s
history. The salty and transient streams and lakes that covered
Meridiani 3 to 4 billion years ago indicate that while chemical
weathering and erosion provided many of the elements required for life, ambient environments were arid, acidic, and
oxidizing. Terrestrial ecology suggests that microorganisms
could survive many aspects of the inferred Meridiani environment, but habitability would depend critically on the time scale
of sufficiently high water activity to support cell biology—a
time scale that is currently unknown.
Whether Meridiani is broadly representative of the Martian surface 3 to 4 billion years ago is unknown, but remote
sensing from orbiting spacecraft suggests that it could be. The
sulfate minerals that are so widespread at Meridiani seem to
be widespread in others areas of the planet, particularly the
equatorial lowlands. However, there appear to be hints that
other combinations of minerals—some dominated by clays—
may be associated with the oldest rocks on Mars. From an
astrobiological perspective this is encouraging because it allows for less acidic conditions. All considered, the formerly

water-drenched rocks at Meridiani are biologically permissive,
but may record the close of a biologically favorable window in
the history of Mars, not its beginning.
For future missions, such as the Mars Science Laboratory
rover, due to launch in 2009, the most promising places to
look for evidence of Mars surface life are probably sedimentary basins that preserve a record of Mars’s earliest history,
when water was most abundant and persistent, and both oxi-

dation and acidity were least developed. Mars Science Laboratory will come with a science payload that is designed to search
for large organic molecules that would provide unambiguous
tests for past life. If present, their discovery would surely rank
as one of the greatest benchmarks in the history of scientific
exploration and would no doubt significantly influence the
way that we think about the origin and evolution of life in the
universe as a whole.

mong the most remarkable sights in our solar system are
the colorful, turbulent atmosphere of Jupiter and the ethereal beauty of Saturn’s rings. Both of these giant worlds
dwarf our own planet: More than 1200 Earths would fit inside
Jupiter’s immense bulk, and more than 700 Earths inside Saturn.
Unlike the Earth, both Jupiter and Saturn are composed primarily of the lightweight elements hydrogen and helium, in abundances very similar to those in the Sun.
As these images show, the rapid rotations of both Jupiter and
Saturn stretch their weather systems into colorful bands that extend completely around each planet. Both planets also have intense magnetic fields that are generated in their interiors, where
hydrogen is so highly compressed that it becomes a metal.
Saturn is not merely a miniature version of Jupiter, however.
Its muted colors and more flattened shape are clues that Saturn’s
atmosphere and interior have important differences from those of

A

Jupiter. The most striking difference is Saturn’s elaborate system
of rings, composed of countless numbers of icy fragments orbiting in the plane of the planet’s equator. The rings display a complex and elegant structure, which is shaped by subtle gravitational
influences from Saturn’s retinue of moons. Jupiter, too, has rings,
but they are made of dark, dustlike particles that reflect little
light. These systems of rings, along with the distinctive properties
of the planets themselves, make Jupiter and Saturn highlights of
our tour of the solar system.

the huge diameters and immense masses of these two planets.
Given the distance to each planet and their angular sizes, they
used the small-angle formula (Box 1-1) to calculate that Jupiter is
about 11 times larger in diameter than Earth, while Saturn’s diameter is about 9 times larger than Earth’s (see Figure 7-2). By
observing the orbits of Jupiter’s four large moons and Saturn’s
large moon Titan (see Table 7-2) and applying Newton’s form of
Kepler’s third law (see Section 4-7 and Box 4-4), astronomers also
determined that Jupiter and Saturn are, respectively, 318 times

Through a telescope, Jupiter at opposition presents a
disk nearly 50 arcsec in diameter, approximately twice
the angular diameter of Mars under the most favorable
conditions (Figure 12-1a). Because Jupiter takes almost a dozen
Earth years to orbit the Sun, it appears to meander slowly across
the 12 constellations of the zodiac at the rate of approximately
one constellation per year. Successive oppositions occur at intervals of about 13 months.

Saturn’s orbital period is even longer, more than 29
Earth years, so it moves even more slowly across the
zodiac. If Saturn did not move at all, successive oppositions would occur exactly one Earth year apart; thanks to its
slow motion, Saturn’s oppositions occur at intervals of about one
year and two weeks. At opposition Saturn appears as a disk about
20 arcsec in diameter, with a dramatic difference from Jupiter: Sat- Even a small telescope

Jupiter from a spacecraft (Figure 12-2a) show alternating dark
and light bands parallel to Jupiter’s equator in subtle tones of red,
orange, brown, and yellow. The dark, reddish bands are called

Saturn in Figure 12-2b shows similar features, but with colors
that are much less pronounced. (We will see in Section 12-4 how
differences between the atmospheres of Jupiter and Saturn can explain Saturn’s washed-out appearance.)
In addition to these conspicuous stripes, a huge, red-orange
oval called the Great Red Spot is often visible in Jupiter’s southern hemisphere. This remarkable feature was first seen by the
English scientist Robert Hooke in 1664 but may be much older.

ANALOGY You can see this kind of rotation, called differential

12-2 Unlike the terrestrial planets, Jupiter
and Saturn exhibit differential rotation
Observations of features like the Great Red Spot and smaller
storms allow astronomers to determine how rapidly Jupiter and
Saturn rotate. At its equator, Jupiter completes a full rotation in
only 9 hours, 50 minutes, and 28 seconds, making it not only the
largest and most massive planet in the solar system but also the
one with the fastest rotation. However, Jupiter rotates in a strikingly different way from the Earth, the Moon, Mercury, Venus,
or Mars.

Differential Rotation
If Jupiter were a solid body like a terrestrial planet (or, for that
matter, a billiard ball), all parts of Jupiter’s surface would rotate
through one complete circle in this same amount of time (Figure
12-3a). But by watching features in Jupiter’s cloud cover, Gian
Domenico Cassini discovered in 1690 that the polar regions of
the planet rotate a little more slowly than do the equatorial regions. (You may recall this Italian astronomer from Section 11-2
as the gifted observer who first determined Mars’s rate of rotation.) Near the poles, the rotation period of Jupiter’s atmosphere
is about 9 hours, 55 minutes, and 41 seconds. Saturn, too, has a

rotation, in the kitchen. As you stir the water in a pot, different
parts of the liquid take different amounts of time to make one
“rotation” around the center of the pot (Figure 12-3b). Differential rotation shows that neither Jupiter nor Saturn can be solid
throughout their volumes: They must be at least partially fluid,
like water in a pot.

The Compositions of Jupiter and Saturn
If Jupiter and Saturn have partially fluid interiors, they cannot be
made of the rocky materials that constitute the terrestrial planets.
An important clue to the compositions of Jupiter and Saturn are
their average densities, which are only 1326 kg/m3 for Jupiter and
687 kg/m3 for Saturn. (By comparison, the Earth’s average density is 5515 kg/m3.) To explain these low average densities,
Rupert Wildt of the University of Göttingen in Germany suggested in the 1930s that Jupiter and Saturn are composed mostly
of hydrogen and helium atoms—the two lightest elements in the
universe—held together by their mutual gravitational attraction
to form a planet. Wildt was motivated in part by his observations
of prominent absorption lines of methane and ammonia in
Jupiter’s spectrum. (We saw in Section 7-3 how spectroscopy plays
an important role in understanding the planets.) A molecule of
methane (CH4) contains four hydrogen atoms, and a molecule of
ammonia (NH3) contains three. The presence of these hydrogenrich molecules was strong, but indirect, evidence of abundant hydrogen in Jupiter’s atmosphere.
Direct evidence for hydrogen and helium in Jupiter’s atmosphere, however, was slow in coming. The problem was that neither gas produces prominent spectral lines in the visible sunlight
reflected from the planet. To show the presence of these elements
conclusively, astronomers had to look for spectral lines in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. These lines are very difficult to
measure from the Earth, because almost no ultraviolet light penetrates Spacecraft observations
our atmosphere (see Figure 6-25).
were needed to
Astronomers first detected the weak

presence of helium on Jupiter and and Saturn
Saturn was finally confirmed in the
1970s and 1980s, when spacecraft first flew past these planets
and measured their hydrogen spectra in detail. (Collisions between helium and hydrogen atoms cause small but measurable
changes in the hydrogen spectrum, which is what the spacecraft
instruments detected.)
Today we know that the chemical composition of Jupiter’s
atmosphere is 86.2% hydrogen molecules (H2), 13.6% helium
atoms, and 0.2% methane, ammonia, water vapor, and other
gases. The percentages in terms of mass are somewhat different
because a helium atom is twice as massive as a hydrogen molecule. Hence, by mass, Jupiter’s atmosphere is approximately 75%
hydrogen, 24% helium, and 1% other substances, quite similar to

Chapter 12

that of the Sun. We will see evidence in Section 12-6 that Jupiter
has a large rocky core made of heavier elements. It is estimated
that the breakdown by mass of the planet as a whole (atmosphere
plus interior) is approximately 71% hydrogen, 24% helium, and
5% all heavier elements.

Saturn’s Missing Helium

ANALOGY An analogy to helium “rainfall” within Saturn is
what happens when you try to sweeten tea by adding sugar. If
the tea is cold, the sugar does not dissolve well and tends to sink
to the bottom of the glass even if you stir the tea with a spoon.
But if the tea is hot, the sugar dissolves with only a little stirring. In the same way, it is thought that the descending helium
droplets once again dissolve in hydrogen once they reach the
warmer depths of Saturn’s interior.
In this scenario, Jupiter and Saturn both have about the same
overall chemical composition. But Saturn’s smaller mass, less than
a third that of Jupiter, means that there is less gravitational force
tending to compress its hydrogen and helium. This explains why
Saturn’s density is only about half that of Jupiter, and is in fact
the lowest of any planet in the solar system.

CAUTION! Because Jupiter and Saturn are almost entirely hydrogen and helium, it would be impossible to land a spacecraft
on either planet. An astronaut foolish enough to try would notice the hydrogen and helium around the spacecraft becoming
denser, the temperature rising, and the pressure increasing as the
spacecraft descended. But the hydrogen and helium would never
solidify into a surface on which the spacecraft could touch down.
Long before reaching the planet’s rocky core, the pressure of the
hydrogen and helium would reach such unimaginably high levels that any spacecraft, even one made of the strongest known
materials, would be crushed.

Most of our detailed understanding of Jupiter and Saturn comes
from a series of robotic spacecraft that have examined these remarkable planets at close range. They found striking evidence of
stable, large-scale weather patterns in both planets’ atmospheres,
as well as evidence of dynamic changes on smaller scales.

Spacecraft to Jupiter and Saturn
BL

INK 1

The first several spacecraft to visit Jupiter and Saturn
each made a single flyby of the planet. Pioneer 10 flew
past Jupiter in December 1973; it was followed a year
later by the nearly identical Pioneer 11, which went on to make
the first-ever flyby of Saturn in 1979. Also in 1979, another pair
of spacecraft, Voyager 1 and Voyager 2, sailed past Jupiter.
These spacecraft sent back spectacular close-up color pictures of
Jupiter’s dynamic atmosphere. Both Voyagers subsequently flew
past Saturn.
The first spacecraft to go into Jupiter orbit was Galileo,
which carried out an extensive program of observations from
1995 to 2003. The Cassini spacecraft went into orbit around Saturn in 2004. A cooperative project of NASA, the European Space
Agency, and the Italian Space Agency, this spacecraft is named for
astronomer Gian Domenico Cassini. On the way to its destination it viewed Jupiter at close range, recording detailed images
such as Figure 12-2a and the image of Jupiter that opens this
chapter.

Like Jupiter, Saturn is thought to have a large rocky core. But unlike Jupiter, data from Earth-based telescopes and spacecraft show
that the atmosphere of Saturn has a serious helium deficiency: Its
chemical composition is 96.3% hydrogen molecules, 3.3% helium, and 0.4% other substances (by mass, 92% hydrogen, 6%
helium, and 2% other substances). This is a puzzle because Jupiter
and Saturn are thought to have formed in similar ways from the
gases of the solar nebula (see Section 8-4), and so both planets
(and the Sun) should have essentially the same abundances of hydrogen and helium. So where did Saturn’s helium go?
The explanation may be simply that Saturn is smaller than
Jupiter, and as a result Saturn probably cooled more rapidly. (We
saw in Section 7-6 why a small world cools down faster than a
large one.) This cooling would have triggered a process analogous
to the way rain develops here on Earth. When the air is cool
enough, humidity in the Earth’s atmosphere condenses into raindrops that fall to the ground. On Saturn, however, it is droplets
of liquid helium that condense within the planet’s cold, hydrogenrich outer layers. In this scenario, helium is deficient in Saturn’s
upper atmosphere simply because it has fallen farther down into
the planet. By contrast, Jupiter’s helium has not rained out because its upper atmosphere is warmer and the helium does not
form droplets.

Observing Jupiter’s Dynamic Atmosphere
While the general pattern of Jupiter’s atmosphere stayed the same
during the four years between the Pioneer and Voyager flybys,
there were some remarkable changes in the area surrounding the
centuries-old Great Red Spot. During the Pioneer flybys, the Great
Red Spot was embedded in a broad white zone that dominated
the planet’s southern hemisphere (Figure 12-4a). By the time of
the Voyager missions, a dark belt
had broadened and encroached on

colliding weather systems in our last for months or years
atmosphere can produce strong
winds and turbulent air, the interaction in Jupiter’s atmosphere
between the belt and the Great Red Spot embroiled the entire region in turbulence (Figure 12-5). By 1995, the Great Red Spot
was once again centered within a white zone (Figure 12-4c); when
Cassini flew past Jupiter in 2000, the dark belt to the north of the
Great Red Spot embroiled the entire region in turbulence.
Over the past three centuries, Earth-based observers have reported many long-term variations in the Great Red Spot’s size
and color. At its largest, it measured 40,000 by 14,000 km—so
large that three Earths could fit side by side across it. At other
times (as in 1976 and 1977), the spot almost faded from view.
During the Voyager flybys of 1979, the Great Red Spot was comparable in size to the Earth (see Figure 12-5).
Clouds at different levels in Jupiter’s atmosphere reflect different wavelengths of infrared light. Using this effect, astronomers

used an infrared telescope on board the Galileo spacecraft to help
clarify the vertical structure of the Great Red Spot. Most of the
Great Red Spot is made of clouds at relatively high altitudes, surrounded by a collar of very low-level clouds about 50 km (30
miles, or 160,000 feet) below the high clouds at the center of the

spot. This same kind of structure is seen in high-pressure areas in
the Earth’s atmosphere, although on a very much smaller scale.
Cloud motions in and around the Great Red Spot reveal that
the spot rotates counterclockwise with a period of about six days.
Furthermore, winds to the north of the spot blow to the west, and
winds south of the spot move toward the east. The circulation
around the Great Red Spot is thus like a wheel spinning between
two oppositely moving surfaces (see Figure 12-5). Weather patterns on the Earth tend to change character and eventually dissipate when they move between plains and mountains or between
land and sea. But because no solid surface or ocean underlies
Jupiter’s clouds, no such changes can occur for the Great Red
Spot—which may explain how this wind pattern has survived for
at least three centuries.
Other persistent features in Jupiter’s atmosphere are the white
ovals. Several white ovals are visible in Figure 12-4b. As in the
Great Red Spot, wind flow in white ovals is counterclockwise.
White ovals are also apparently long-lived; Earth-based observers
have reported seeing them in the same location since 1938.
Most of the white ovals are observed in Jupiter’s southern
hemisphere, whereas brown ovals are more common in Jupiter’s
northern hemisphere. Brown ovals appear dark in a visible-light
image like Figure 12-4b, but they appear bright in an infrared image. For this reason, brown ovals are understood to be holes in
Jupiter’s cloud cover. They permit us to see into the depths of the
Jovian atmosphere, where the temperature is higher and the atmosphere emits infrared light more strongly. White ovals, by contrast, have relatively low temperatures. They are areas with cold,
high-altitude clouds that block our view of the lower levels of the
atmosphere.
Between 1998 and 2000 three white ovals merged in Jupiter’s
southern hemisphere. The merger of these ovals, each of which
had been observed for 60 years, led to the formation of a massive
storm about half the size of the Great Red Spot (Figure 12-6).
Time will tell whether this new feature is as long-lived as its larger
cousin.

Regularities in Jupiter’s Atmosphere
The Voyager, Galileo, and Cassini images might suggest a state
of incomprehensible turmoil, but, surprisingly, there is also great
regularity in the Jovian atmosphere. The views in Figure 12-7 (assembled from a large number of Cassini images) show how Jupiter
would look to someone located directly over either the planet’s
north pole or its south pole. Note the regular spacing of such
cloud features as ripples, plumes, colored wisps, and white ovals
in the southern hemisphere. These regularities are probably the
result of stable, large-scale weather patterns that encircle Jupiter.

and the heated surface in turn warms the atmosphere and stirs it
into motion (see Sections 9-1 and 9-5). The energy of sunlight
also powers the motions of the atmospheres of Venus and Mars
(see Section 11-6). On both Jupiter and Saturn, however, atmospheric motions are powered both by solar energy and by the internal energy of the planet.

Saturn’s storms are thought to form when warm atmospheric gases rise upward and cool, causing gaseous ammonia to solidify into crystals and form white clouds.
On Earth, similar rapid lifting of air occurs within thunderstorms
and can cause water droplets to solidify into hailstones. Earth
thunderstorms produce electrical discharges (lightning) that generate radio waves, which you hear as “static” on an AM radio.
Radio receivers on board Cassini have recorded similar “static”
emitted by storms on Saturn, which strongly reinforces the idea
that these storms are like thunderstorms on Earth.

12-4 The internal heat of Jupiter and
Saturn has a major effect on the
planets’ atmospheres
Weather patterns on Earth are the result of the motions of air
masses. Winter storms in the midwestern United States occur
when cold, moist air moves southward from Canada, and tropical storms in the southwest United States are caused by the northeastward motion of hot, moist air from Hawaii. All such motions,
as well as the overall global circulation of our atmosphere, are
powered by the Sun. Sunlight is absorbed by the Earth’s surface,

In the late 1960s, astronomers using Earth-based telescopes made
the remarkable discovery that Jupiter emits more energy in the
form of infrared radiation than it absorbs from sunlight—in fact,
about twice as much. (By comparison, the internal heat that the
Earth radiates into space is only about 0.005% of what it absorbs
from the Sun.) The excess heat presently escaping from Jupiter is
thought to be energy left over from the formation of the planet
4.56 billion years ago. As gases from the solar nebula fell into the
protoplanet, vast amounts of gravitational energy were converted
into thermal energy that heated the planet’s interior. Jupiter has
been slowly radiating this energy into space ever since. Because
Jupiter is so large, it has retained substantial thermal energy even
after billions of years, and so still has plenty of energy to emit as
infrared radiation.
Saturn, too, radiates into space more energy than it receives
as sunlight. Because Saturn is smaller than Jupiter, it should have
begun with less internal heat trapped inside, and it should have
radiated that heat away more rapidly. Hence, we would expect
Saturn to be radiating very little energy today. In fact, when we
take Saturn’s smaller mass into account, we find that Saturn releases about 25% more energy from its interior on a per-kilogram
basis than does Jupiter. The explanation for this seeming paradox
may be that helium is raining out of Saturn’s upper atmosphere,
as we described in Section 12-2. The helium condenses into
droplets at cold upper altitudes, but generates heat at lower altitudes due to friction between the falling droplets and the surrounding gases. This heat eventually escapes from the planet’s
surface as infrared radiation. This “raining out” of helium from
Saturn’s upper layers is calculated to have begun 2 billion years ago.
The amount of thermal energy released by this process adequately
accounts for the extra heat radiated by Saturn since that time.
Heat naturally flows from a hot place to a colder place, never
the other way around. Hence, in order for heat to flow upward
through the atmospheres of Jupiter and Saturn and radiate out
into space, the temperature must be warmer deep inside the atmosphere than it is at the cloudtops. Infrared measurements have
confirmed that the temperature within the atmospheres of both
planets does indeed increase with increasing depth (Figure 12-9).

ANALOGY You can understand the statement that “heat naturally flows from a hot place to a colder place” by visualizing an
ice cube placed on a hot frying pan. Experience tells you that
the hot frying pan cools down a little while the ice warms up
and melts. If heat were to flow the other way, the ice would get
colder and the frying pan would get hotter—which never happens in the real world.

planets’ cloud layers, the atmosphere is composed almost
entirely of hydrogen and helium. (Adapted from A. P. Ingersoll)

westward zonal winds. Wind speeds on Jupiter can exceed
500 km/h (300 mi/h). The Earth’s atmospheric circulation has a
similar pattern of eastward and westward flow (see Figure 9-24),
but with slower wind speeds. The faster winds on Jupiter presumably result from the planet’s more rapid rotation as well as the
substantial flow of heat from the planet’s interior.
The zonal winds on Jupiter are generally strongest at the
boundaries between belts and zones. Within a given belt or zone,
the wind reverses direction between the northern and southern
boundaries. As Figure 12-5 shows, such reversals in wind direction are associated with circulating storms such as the Great Red
Spot.
Saturn rotates at about the same rate as Jupiter, but its interior releases less heat and it receives only a quarter as much
energy in sunlight as does Jupiter. With less energy available to
power the motions of Saturn’s atmosphere, we would expect its
zonal winds to be slower than Jupiter’s. Surprisingly, Saturn’s
winds are faster! In 1980 the Voyager spacecraft measured
wind speeds near Saturn’s equator that approach 1800 km/h
(1100 mi/h), approximately two-thirds the speed of sound in
Saturn’s atmosphere and faster than winds on any other planet.
Since then the equatorial winds seem to have abated somewhat:
Between 1996 and 2004, astronomers using the Hubble Space
Telescope showed that the wind speed had slowed to about
1000 km/h, and in 2005 Cassini measured wind speeds of about
1350 km/h at the equator. (These changes may be due to seasonal variations or changes in Saturn’s clouds.) Why Saturn’s
winds should be even faster than Jupiter’s is not yet completely
understood.

distributed through the fluid is by the up-and-down motion called
convection. (We introduced the idea of convection in Section
9-1; see, in particular, Figure 9-5.) For many years it was thought
that Jupiter’s light-colored zones are regions where warm gas
from low levels is rising and cooling, forming high-altitude clouds,
while the dark-colored belts are regions where cool high-altitude
gas is descending and being heated. However, this picture has
been called into question by images made by Cassini during its
2000–2001 flyby of Jupiter, which showed details as small as
58 km (36 mi) across. The Cassini images revealed numerous
white cloud cells welling upward in Jupiter’s atmosphere, almost
all of which appeared in the dark belts.
One interpretation of these observations is that air is actually
rising in the belts and sinking in the zones. Another suggestion is
that air is rising in the zones and producing clouds, but these are
hidden from our view by a high-altitude layer of opaque white
ammonia crystals. In this model the belts are regions in which air
is descending except in the localized regions where the clouds seen
by Cassini are found.
One thing that is well known about Jupiter’s atmosphere is
that the belts are regions in which we can see into the atmosphere’s lower levels. You can see this in Figure 12-10, which
compares visible-light and infrared images of Jupiter. The cold
Jovian clouds emit radiation primarily at infrared wavelengths,
with an intensity that depends on the cloud temperature (see Section 5-4) and hence on the depth of the cloud within the atmosphere (see Figure 12-9a). The infrared image in Figure 12-10b
shows stronger emission from the belts, where we are looking at
lower-lying, warmer levels of Jupiter’s atmosphere.

In addition to the vertical motion of gases within the
belts and zones, the very rapid rotation of both Jupiter
and Saturn creates a global pattern of eastward and

From spectroscopic observations and calculations of atmospheric
temperature and pressure, scientists conclude that both Jupiter
and Saturn have three main cloud layers of differing chemical

composition. The uppermost cloud layer is composed of crystals
of frozen ammonia. Deeper in the atmosphere, ammonia (NH3)
and hydrogen sulfide (H2S)—a compound of hydrogen and
sulfur—combine to produce ammonium hydrosulfide (NH4SH)
crystals. At even greater depths, the clouds are composed of crystals of frozen water.
Jupiter’s strong surface gravity compresses these cloud layers
into a region just 75 km deep in the planet’s upper atmosphere
(Figure 12-9a). But Saturn has a smaller mass and hence weaker
surface gravity, so the atmosphere is less compressed and the
same three cloud layers are spread out over a range of nearly
300 km (Figure 12-9b). The colors of Saturn’s clouds are less dramatic than Jupiter’s (see Figure 12-2) because deeper cloud layers
are partially obscured by the hazy atmosphere above them.
The colors of clouds on Jupiter and Saturn depend on the
temperatures of the clouds and, therefore, on the depth of the
clouds within the atmosphere. Brown clouds are the warmest and
are thus the deepest layers that we can see. Whitish clouds form
the next layer up, followed by red clouds in the highest layer. The
whitish zones on each planet are therefore somewhat higher than
the brownish belts, while the red clouds in Jupiter’s Great Red
Spot are among the highest found anywhere on that planet.
Despite all the data from various spacecraft, we still do not
know what gives the clouds of Jupiter and Saturn their colors.
The crystals of NH3, NH4SH, and water ice in the three main
cloud layers are all white. Thus, other chemicals must cause the
browns, reds, and oranges. Certain molecules closely related to
ammonium hydrosulfide, which can form into long chains that
have a yellow-brown color, may play a role. Compounds of sulfur or phosphorus, which can assume many different colors, de-

pending on their temperature, might also be involved. The Sun’s
ultraviolet radiation may induce the chemical reactions that produce these colorful compounds.

12-5 A space probe has explored Jupiter’s
deep atmosphere
By observing Jupiter’s and Saturn’s cloud layers from a distance,
we have been able to learn a great deal about the atmospheres beneath the clouds. But there is no substitute for making measurements on site, and for many years scientists planned to send a
spacecraft to explore deep into Jupiter’s atmosphere. While still
81.52 million kilometers (50.66 million miles) from Jupiter, the
Galileo spacecraft released the Galileo Probe, a cone-shaped body
about the size of an office desk. While Galileo itself later fired its
rockets to place itself into an orbit around Jupiter, the Galileo
Probe continued on a course that led it on December 7, 1995, to
a point in Jupiter’s clouds just north of the planet’s equator.

Exploring Jupiter’s Atmosphere
A heat shield protected the Galileo Probe as air friction slowed
its descent speed from 171,000 km/h (106,000 mi/h) to 40 km/h
(25 mi/h) in just 3 minutes. The spacecraft then deployed a parachute and floated down through the atmosphere (Figure 12-11).
For the next hour, the probe observed its surroundings and radioed its findings back to the main Galileo spacecraft, which in
turn radioed them to Earth. The mission ceased at a point some
200 km (120 mi) below Jupiter’s upper cloud layer, where the

312

Chapter 12

break in the cloud cover allows a view of Jupiter’s warm interior
(see Figure 12-10b).
The Galileo Probe also made measurements of the chemical
composition of Jupiter’s atmosphere. These revealed that the relative proportions of hydrogen and helium are almost exactly the
same as in the Sun, in line with the accepted picture of how
Jupiter formed from the solar nebula (see Section 8-4). But a number of heavy elements, including carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur,
were found to be significantly more abundant on Jupiter than in
the Sun. This was an expected result. Over the past several billion years, Jupiter’s strong gravity should have pulled in many
pieces of interplanetary debris, thus building up a small but appreciable abundance of heavy elements.
Water is a major constituent of small bodies in the outer solar system and thus should likewise be present inside Jupiter in
noticeable quantities. Surprisingly, the amount of water actually
detected by the Galileo Probe was less than half the expected
amount. One proposed explanation for this disparity is that the
hot spot where the probe entered the atmosphere was also unusually dry. If this explanation is correct, Jupiter’s hot spots are analogous to hot, dry deserts on Earth. An alternative idea is that
more water than expected has rained out of Jupiter’s upper atmosphere and coalesced deep within the planet. For now, the enigma
of Jupiter’s missing water remains unresolved.

tremendous pressure (24 atmospheres) and high temperature
(152°C ⫽ 305°F) finally overwhelmed the probe’s electronics.
Although the Galileo Probe did not have a camera, it did
carry a variety of instruments that made several new discoveries.
A radio-emissions detector found evidence for lightning discharges
that, while less frequent than on Earth, are individually much
stronger than lightning bolts in our atmosphere. Other measurements showed that Jupiter’s winds, which are brisk in the atmosphere above the clouds, are even stronger beneath the clouds:
The Galileo Probe measured a nearly constant wind speed of
650 km/h (400 mi/h) throughout its descent. This shows convincingly that the energy source for the winds is Jupiter’s interior
heat. If the winds were driven primarily by solar heating, as is the
case on Earth, the wind speed would have decreased with increasing depth.
A central purpose of the Galileo Probe mission was to test
the three-layer cloud model depicted in Figure 12-9a by making
direct measurements of Jupiter’s clouds. But the probe saw only
traces of the NH3 and NH4SH cloud layers and found no sign at
all of the low-lying water clouds. One explanation of this surprising result is that the probe by sheer chance entered a hot spot, an
unusually warm and cloud-free part of Jupiter’s atmosphere. Indeed, observations from the Earth showed strong infrared emission from the probe entry site, as would be expected where a

Another surprising and potentially important result from the
Galileo Probe concerns three elements, argon (Ar), krypton (Kr),
and xenon (Xe). These elements are three of the so-called noble
gases, which do not combine with other atoms to form molecules.
(The noble gases, which also include helium, appear in the rightmost column of the periodic table in Box 5-5.) All three of these
elements appear in tiny amounts in the Earth’s atmosphere and in
the Sun, and so must also have been present in the solar nebula.
But the Galileo Probe found that argon, krypton, and xenon are
about 3 times as abundant in Jupiter’s atmosphere as in the Sun’s.
If these elements were incorporated into Jupiter directly from
the gases of the solar nebula, they should be equally as abundant
in Jupiter as in the Sun (which formed from the gas at the center
of the solar nebula; see Section 8-3). So, the excess amounts of
argon, krypton, and xenon must have entered Jupiter in the form
of solid planetesimals, just as did carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur.
But at Jupiter’s distance from the Sun, the presumed temperature
of the solar nebula was too high to permit argon, krypton, or
xenon to solidify. How, then, did
the excess amounts of these noble Measuring trace amounts

of rare gases on Jupiter
Several hypotheses have been
provides clues about the
proposed to explain these results.
One idea is that icy bodies, includ- origins of the planets
ing solid argon, krypton, and xenon,
formed in an interstellar cloud even before the cloud collapsed to
form the solar nebula. A second notion is that the solar nebula
may actually have been colder than previously thought. If either
of these ideas proves to be correct, it would mean that Jovian
planets can form closer to their stars than had heretofore been
thought. This would help to explain why astronomers find massive, presumably Jovian planets orbiting close to stars other than
the Sun (see Section 8-5).

Jupiter and Saturn: Lords of the Planets

A third hypothesis proposes that our models of the solar nebula are correct, but that Jupiter originally formed much farther
from the Sun. Out in the cold, remote reaches of the solar nebula, argon, krypton, and xenon could have solidified into icy particles and fallen into the young Jupiter, thus enriching it in those
elements. Interactions between Jupiter and the material of the solar nebula could then have forced the planet to spiral inward,
eventually reaching its present distance from the Sun. As we saw
in Section 8-5, a model of this kind has been proposed to explain
why extrasolar planets orbit so close to their stars. More research
will be needed to decide which of these hypotheses is closest to
the truth.
The story of the Galileo Probe exemplifies two of the most
remarkable aspects of scientific research. First, when new scientific observations are made, the results often pose many new questions at the same time that they provide answers to some old
ones. And second, it sometimes happens that investigating what
might seem to be trivial details—such as the abundances of trace
elements in Jupiter’s atmosphere—can reveal clues about truly
grand issues, such as how the planets formed.

313

Modeling Jupiter and Saturn’s Interiors
The oblateness of a planet depends both on its rotation rate and
on how the planet’s mass is distributed over its volume. The challenge to planetary scientists is to create a model of a planet’s mass
distribution that gives the right value for the oblateness. One such
model for Jupiter suggests that 2.6% of its mass is concentrated
in a dense, rocky core (Figure 12-12a). Although this core has about
8 times the mass of the Earth, the crushing weight of the remaining bulk of Jupiter compresses it to a diameter of just 11,000 km,
slightly smaller than the Earth’s diameter of 12,800 km. The pressure at the center of the core is estimated to be about 70 million
atmospheres, and the central temperature is probably about
22,000 K. By contrast, the temperature at Jupiter’s cloudtops is
only 165 K.
If Jupiter formed by accretion of gases onto a rocky “seed,”
the present-day core is presumably that very seed. However, additional amounts of rocky material were presumably added later

(a) Jupiter

12-6 The oblateness of Jupiter and Saturn
reveals their rocky cores
The Galileo Probe penetrated only a few hundred kilometers into
Jupiter’s atmosphere before being crushed. To learn about
Jupiter’s structure at greater depths as well as that of Saturn, astronomers must use indirect clues. The shapes of Jupiter and Saturn are important clues, since they indicate the size of the rocky
cores at the centers of the planets.

Oblateness and Rotation
Even a casual glance through a small telescope shows that Jupiter
and Saturn are not spherical but slightly flattened or oblate. (You
can see this in Figures 12-1 and 12-2.) The diameter across Jupiter’s
equator (142,980 km) is 6.5% larger than its diameter from pole
to pole (133,700 km). Thus, Jupiter is said to have an oblateness
of 6.5%, or 0.065. Saturn has an even larger oblateness of 9.8%,
or 0.098, making it the most oblate of all the planets. By comparison, the oblateness of the Earth is just 0.34%, or 0.0034.
If Jupiter and Saturn did not rotate, both would be perfect
spheres. A massive, nonrotating object naturally settles into a
spherical shape so that every atom on its surface experiences the
same gravitational pull aimed directly at the object’s center. Because Jupiter and Saturn do rotate, however, the body of each
planet tends to fly outward and away from the axis of rotation.

diagrams of the interiors of Jupiter and Saturn are drawn to
the same scale. Each planet’s rocky core is surrounded by an outer core of
liquid “ices,” a layer of helium and liquid metallic hydrogen, and a layer of
helium and ordinary molecular hydrogen (H2). Saturn’s rocky core contains
a larger fraction of the planet’s mass than does Jupiter’s, while Saturn has
a smaller volume of liquid metallic hydrogen than does Jupiter.

around. Your arms will naturally tend to fly outward, away
from the vertical axis of rotation of your body. Likewise, if you
drive your car around a circular road, you feel thrown toward
the outside of the circle; the car as a whole is rotating around
the center of the circle, and you tend to move away from the rotation axis. (We discussed the physical principles behind this in
Box 4-3.) For Jupiter and Saturn, this same effect deforms the
planets into their nonspherical, oblate shapes.

by meteoritic material that fell into the planet and sank to the
center. (If Jupiter formed directly from the gases of the solar nebula, this additional material makes up the present-day core.) Material from icy planetesimals, too, would have sunk deep within
Jupiter and added to the core. In the model we have been describing, these “ices”—principally water (H2O), methane (CH4), ammonia (NH3), and other molecules made by chemical reactions
among these substances—form a layer some 3000 km thick that
surrounds the rocky core. (Because these substances are less dense
than rock, they “float” on top of the rocky core.) Despite the high
pressures in this layer, the temperature is so high that the “ices”
are probably in a liquid state.
Saturn rotates at about the same rate as Jupiter but has less
mass, and therefore less gravity to pull its material inward. Hence,
Saturn’s rotation should cause material at its equator to bulge
outward more than on Jupiter, giving Saturn a greater oblateness.
In fact, if Saturn and Jupiter had the same internal structure, we
would actually expect Saturn to be even more oblate than it really is. We can account for this discrepancy if Saturn has a different mass distribution than Jupiter. Detailed calculations suggest
that about 10% of Saturn’s mass is contained in its rocky core,
compared to 2.6% for Jupiter’s rocky core (see Figure 12-12b).
As for Jupiter, the rocky core of Saturn is probably surrounded
by an outer core of liquid “ices.”

12-7 Metallic hydrogen inside Jupiter and
Saturn endows the planets with strong
magnetic fields
The oblateness of Jupiter and Saturn gives information about the
size of the planets’ rocky cores. It does not, however, provide
much insight into the planets’ bulk between their cores and their
colorful cloudtops. Most of our knowledge of these parts of the
interiors of Jupiter and Saturn comes from observations with radio telescopes. By using these telescopes to detect radio waves
from Jupiter and Saturn, astronomers have found evidence of
electric currents flowing within both planets’ hydrogen-rich
interiors.

Radio Emissions from Jupiter
Astronomers began discovering radio emissions coming from
Jupiter in the 1950s. A small portion of these emissions is thermal radiation, with the sort of spectrum that would be expected
from an opaque object due to its temperature. (We discussed the
electromagnetic radiation from heated objects in Sections 5-3 and
5-4.) However, most of the radio energy emitted from Jupiter is
nonthermal radiation. This has a very different sort of spectrum
from radiation from a heated object and is found in two distinct
wavelength ranges.
At wavelengths of a few meters, Jupiter emits sporadic bursts
of radio waves. This decametric (10-meter) radiation is probably
caused by electrical discharges associated with powerful electric
currents in Jupiter’s ionosphere. These discharges result from electromagnetic interactions between Jupiter and its large satellite Io.
At shorter wavelengths of a few tenths of a meter, Jupiter emits
a nearly constant stream of electromagnetic radiation. The prop-

erties of this decimetric (tenth-meter) radiation show that it is
emitted by electrons moving through a strong magnetic field at
speeds comparable to the speed of light. The magnetic field deflects the electrons into spiral-shaped trajectories, and the spiraling electrons radiate energy like miniature radio antennas. Energy
produced in this fashion is called synchrotron radiation. Astronomers now realize that synchrotron radiation is very important in a wide range of situations throughout the universe,
including radio emissions from entire galaxies.

Jupiter’s Magnetic Field
If some of Jupiter’s radiation is indeed synchrotron radiation,
then Jupiter must have a magnetic field. Measurements by the Pioneer and Voyager spacecraft verified this and indicated that the
field at Jupiter’s equator is 14 times stronger than at the Earth’s
equator. Like the Earth’s magnetic field, Jupiter’s field is thought
to be generated by motions of an electrically conducting fluid in
the planet’s interior. But wholly unlike Earth, the moving fluid
within Jupiter is an exotic form of hydrogen called liquid metallic hydrogen.
As we discussed in Section 7-7, hydrogen becomes a liquid
metal only when the pressure exceeds about 1.4 million atmospheres. This occurs at depths more than about 7000 km below
Jupiter’s cloudtops. Thus, the internal structure of Jupiter consists
of four distinct regions, as shown in Figure 12-12a: a rocky core,
a roughly 3000-km thick layer of liquid “ices,” a layer of helium
and liquid metallic hydrogen about 56,000 km thick, and a layer
of helium and ordinary hydrogen about 7000 km thick. The colorful cloud patterns that we can see through telescopes are located in the outermost 100 km of the outer layer.
Figure 12-12a shows that much of the enormous bulk of
Jupiter is composed of liquid metallic hydrogen. Jupiter’s rapid
rotation sets the liquid metallic hydrogen into motion, giving rise
to a powerful dynamo 20,000 times stronger than Earth’s and
generating an intense magnetic field.

Saturn’s Magnetic Field
Saturn also has a substantial magnetic field, but it pales by Jupiter
standards: Saturn’s internal dynamo is only 3% as strong as
Jupiter’s. (To be fair, it is still 600 times stronger than Earth’s dynamo.) This difference between the planets suggests that even
though Saturn rotates nearly as rapidly as Jupiter, there must be
far less liquid metallic hydrogen within Saturn to be stirred up by
the rotation and thereby generate a magnetic field. This makes
sense: Compared to Jupiter, Saturn has less mass, less gravity, and
less internal pressure to compress ordinary hydrogen into liquid
metallic hydrogen. As a consequence, as Figure 10-14b shows,
liquid metallic hydrogen probably makes up only a relatively
small fraction of Saturn’s bulk.

Jupiter’s Magnetosphere
Jupiter’s strong magnetic field surrounds the planet with a magnetosphere so large that it envelops the orbits of many of its
moons. The Pioneer and Voyager spacecraft, which carried instruments to detect charged particles and magnetic fields, revealed
the awesome dimensions of the Jovian magnetosphere. The shock
wave that surrounds Jupiter’s magnetosphere is nearly 30 million

smaller magnetosphere, shown in Both Jupiter and Saturn
Figure 9-19.)
have magnetospheres
The outer boundary of Jupiter’s
magnetosphere (on the left in Figure that are millions of
12-13) lies at distances ranging from kilometers across
3 to 7 million kilometers (2 to 4 million miles) above the planet. The “downstream” side of the magnetosphere (on the right in Figure 12-13) extends for more than
a billion kilometers (650 million miles), even beyond the orbit of
Saturn.
The inner regions of the Earth’s magnetosphere are dominated by two huge Van Allen belts (recall Figure 9-20), which are
filled with charged particles. In a similar manner, Jupiter entraps
immense quantities of charged particles in belts of its own. An astronaut venturing into these belts would quickly receive a lethal
dose of radiation. In addition, Jupiter’s rapid rotation spews the
charged particles out into a huge current sheet, which lies close
to the plane of Jupiter’s magnetic equator (see Figure 12-13).
Jupiter’s magnetic axis is inclined 11° from the planet’s axis of rotation, and the orientation of Jupiter’s magnetic field is the reverse of the Earth’s magnetic field—a compass would point toward
the south on Jupiter.
Figure 12-14 shows radio emissions from charged particles in
the densest regions of Jupiter’s magnetosphere. These emissions
vary slightly with a period of 9 hours, 55 minutes, and 30 seconds, as Jupiter’s rotation changes the angle at which we view its
magnetic field. Because the magnetic field is anchored deep within
the planet, this variation reveals Jupiter’s internal rotation period.
This period, indicative of the rotation of the bulk of the planet’s
mass, is slightly slower than the atmospheric rotation at the equator (period 9 hours, 50 minutes, 28 seconds) but about the same
as the atmospheric rotation at the poles (period 9 hours, 55 minutes, 41 seconds). The faster motion of the atmosphere at the
equator relative to the interior is driven by Jupiter’s internal heat.
The Voyager spacecraft discovered that the inner regions of
Jupiter’s magnetosphere contain a hot, gaslike mixture of charged
particles called a plasma. A plasma is formed when a gas is heated

to such extremely high temperatures that electrons are torn off
the atoms of the gas. As a result, a plasma is a mixture of positively charged ions and negatively charged electrons. The plasma
that envelops Jupiter consists primarily of electrons and protons,
with some ions of helium, sulfur, and oxygen. A major source of
these particles is Jupiter’s volcanically active moon Io (see Table
7-2), which lies deep within the magnetosphere. Io ejects a ton of
material into Jupiter’s magnetosphere each second from its surface and volcanic plumes. These charged particles are caught up
in Jupiter’s rapidly rotating magnetic field and are accelerated to
high speeds.
The fast-moving particles in Jupiter’s plasma exert a substantial pressure that holds off the solar wind. The Voyager data suggest that the pressure balance between the solar wind and the hot
plasma inside the Jovian magnetosphere is precarious. A gust in
the solar wind can blow away some of the plasma, at which point
the magnetosphere deflates rapidly to as little as one-half its

original size. However, additional electrons and ions accelerated
by Jupiter’s rotating magnetic field soon replenish the plasma,
and the magnetosphere expands again.

Saturn’s Magnetosphere
Saturn’s magnetosphere is similar to Jupiter’s, but is only about
10 to 20% as large and contains far fewer charged particles than
Jupiter’s. There are two reasons for this deficiency. First, Saturn
lacks a highly volcanic moon like Io to inject particles into the
magnetosphere. Second, and more important, many charged particles are absorbed by the icy particles that make up Saturn’s rings
(see Section 12-10). The charged particles that do exist in Saturn’s
magnetosphere are concentrated in radiation belts similar to the
Van Allen belts in the Earth’s magnetosphere.
Cassini measurements show, however, that the moons of Saturn do influence the magnetosphere. The inner magnetosphere is
dominated by water and atomic oxygen, material that is thought
to come from the planet’s icy moons (which we will discuss in
Chapter 13), as well as from Saturn’s rings (which we will learn
about later in this chapter).

As for Jupiter, the motion of Saturn’s magnetic field allows us to track the planet’s internal rotation. Voyager

measurements in 1980 showed Saturn is similar to Jupiter in that
its internal rotation period (10 hours, 39 minutes, and 25 seconds) is slower than the rotation period of the visible surface at
the equator (10 hours, 13 minutes, and 59 seconds). Surprisingly,
when Cassini repeated these measurements in 2003–2004, it found
that the magnetosphere’s rotation had slowed down: The new rotation period is 10 hours, 45 minutes, and 45 seconds, more than
6 minutes longer than in 1980. It seems unlikely that the rotation
of the planet’s interior could have slowed so much in such a short
time. Instead, the magnetic field inside Saturn may have slipped
and reattached itself at higher latitudes, where the differentially
rotating planet spins at a slower rate. The reason for this slippage
is not known.

Aurorae on Jupiter and Saturn
On Earth, particles trapped in our planet’s magnetic field stream
onto the north and south magnetic poles, creating the aurora (see
Section 9-4). The same effect takes place on both Jupiter and Saturn. Figure 12-15 shows images from the Hubble Space Telescope
that reveal glowing auroral rings centered on the north and south
magnetic poles of Jupiter and of Saturn. As on Earth, the emission comes from a region high in each planet’s atmosphere, hundreds of kilometers above the cloudtops.

12-8 Earth-based observations reveal three
broad rings encircling Saturn
Compared to Saturn, Jupiter is unquestionably larger, more massive, more colorful, and more dynamic in both its atmosphere and
magnetosphere. But as seen through even a small telescope, Saturn stands out as perhaps the most beautiful of all the worlds of
the solar system, thanks to its majestic rings (Figure 12-16). As
we will see in Section 12-9, Jupiter also has rings, but they are so
faint that they were not discovered until spacecraft could observe
Jupiter at close range.

317

As the quality of telescopes improved, astronomers realized
that Saturn’s “ring” is actually a system of rings, as Figure 12-16
shows. In 1675, the Italian astronomer Cassini discovered a dark
division in the ring. The Cassini division is an apparent gap about
4500 kilometers wide that separates the outer A ring from the
brighter B ring closer to the planet. In the mid-1800s, astronomers
managed to identify the faint C ring, or crepe ring, that lies just
inside the B ring.
Saturn and its rings are best seen when the planet is at or near
opposition. A modest telescope gives a good view of the A and B
rings, but a large telescope and excellent observing conditions are
needed to see the C ring.

Discovering Saturn’s Rings
In 1610, Galileo became the first person to see Saturn through a
telescope. He saw few details, but he did notice two puzzling
lumps protruding from opposite edges of the planet’s disk. Curiously, these lumps disappeared in 1612, only to reappear in 1613.
Other observers saw similar appearances and disappearances over
the next several decades.
In 1655, the Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens began to
observe Saturn with a better telescope than was available to any
of his predecessors. (We discussed in Section 11-2 how Huygens
used this same telescope to observe Mars.) On the basis of his observations, Huygens suggested that Saturn was surrounded by a
thin, flattened ring. At times this ring was edge-on as viewed from
the Earth, making it almost impossible to see. At other times
Earth observers viewed Saturn from an angle either above or below the plane of the ring, and the ring was visible, as in Figure
12-1. (The lumps that Galileo saw were the parts of the ring to
either side of Saturn, blurred by the poor resolution of his rather
small telescope.) Astronomers confirmed this brilliant deduction
over the next several years as they watched the ring’s appearance
change just as Huygens had predicted.

How the Rings Appear from Earth
Earth-based views of the Saturnian ring system change as Saturn
slowly orbits the Sun. Huygens was the first to understand that
this change occurs because the rings
lie in the plane of Saturn’s equator, As seen from Earth,
and this plane is tilted 27° from the
Saturn’s rings change
plane of Saturn’s orbit. As Saturn
their orientation as the
orbits the Sun, its rotation axis and
the plane of its equator maintain the planet orbits the Sun
same orientation in space. (The same
is true for the Earth; see Figure 2-12.) Hence, over the course of
a Saturnian year, an Earth-based observer views the rings from
various angles (Figure 12-17). At certain times Saturn’s north pole
is tilted toward the Earth and the observer looks “down” on the
“top side” of the rings. Half a Saturnian year later, Saturn’s south
pole is tilted toward us and the “underside” of the rings is exposed to our Earth-based view.
When our line of sight to Saturn is in the plane of the rings,
the rings are viewed edge-on and seem to disappear entirely (see the
images at the upper left and lower right corners of Figure 12-17).

The Changing Appearance of Saturn’s Rings Saturn’s

rings are aligned with its equator, which is tilted 27° from
Saturn’s orbital plane. As Saturn moves around its orbit, the rings
maintain the same orientation in space, so observers on Earth see the

This disappearance indicates that the rings are very thin. In fact,
they are thought to be only a few tens of meters thick. In proportion to their diameter, Saturn’s rings are thousands of times thinner than the sheets of paper used to print this book.
The last edge-on presentation of Saturn’s rings of the 20th
century was in 1995–1996; the first two of the 21st century are
in 2008–2009 and in 2025. From 1996 to 2008, we Earth observers see the “underside” of the rings (as in the image at the
lower left corner of Figure 12-17); from 2009 until 2025 we see
the “top” of the rings.

12-9 Saturn’s rings are composed of
numerous icy fragments, while Jupiter’s
rings are made of small rocky particles
Astronomers have long known that Saturn’s rings could not possibly be solid sheets of matter. In 1857, the Scottish physicist
James Clerk Maxwell (whom we last encountered in Section 5-2)
proved theoretically that if the rings were solid, differences in Saturn’s gravitational pull on different parts of the rings would cause
the rings to tear apart. He concluded that Saturn’s rings are made
of “an indefinite number of unconnected particles.”

Ring Particles
In 1895, James Keeler at the Allegheny Observatory in Pittsburgh
became the first to confirm by observation that the rings are not

rings at various angles. The accompanying Earth-based photographs
show Saturn at various points in its orbit. Note that the rings seem to
disappear entirely when viewed edge-on, which occurs about every
15 years. (Lowell Observatory)

rigid. He did this by photographing the spectrum of sunlight reflected from Saturn’s rings. As the rings orbit Saturn, the spectral
lines from the side approaching us are blueshifted by the Doppler
effect (recall Section 5-9, especially Figure 5-26). At the same
time, spectral lines from the receding side of the rings are redshifted. Keeler noted that the size of the wavelength shift increased inward across the rings—the closer to the planet, the
greater the shift. This variation in Doppler shift proved that the
inner portions of Saturn’s rings are moving around the planet
more rapidly than the outer portions. Indeed, the orbital speeds
across the rings are in complete agreement with Kepler’s third
law: The square of the orbital period about Saturn at any place
in the rings is proportional to the cube of the distance from Saturn’s center (see Section 4-7 and Box 4-4). This is exactly what
would be expected if the rings consisted of numerous tiny “moonlets,” or ring particles, each individually circling Saturn.
Saturn’s rings are quite bright; they reflect 80% of the sunlight that falls on them. (By comparison, Saturn itself reflects
46% of incoming sunlight.) Astronomers therefore long suspected
that the ring particles are made of ice and ice-coated rock. This
hunch was confirmed in the 1970s, when the American astronomers Gerard P. Kuiper and Carl Pilcher identified absorption features of frozen water in the rings’ near-infrared spectrum.
The Voyager and Cassini spacecraft have made even more detailed infrared measurements that indicate the temperature of the
rings ranges from –180°C (–290°F) in the sunshine to less than
–200°C (–330°F) in Saturn’s shadow. Water ice is in no danger
of melting or evaporating at these temperatures.

Jupiter and Saturn: Lords of the Planets

The Roche Limit
All of Saturn’s material may be ancient debris that failed to accrete (fall together) into satellites. The total amount of material
in the rings is quite small. If Saturn’s entire ring system were compressed together to make a satellite, it would be no more than
100 km (60 mi) in diameter. But, in fact, the ring particles are so
close to Saturn that they will never be able to form moons.
To see why, imagine a collection of small particles orbiting a
planet. Gravitational attraction between neighboring particles
tends to pull the particles together. However, because the various
particles are at differing distances from the parent planet, they
also experience different amounts of gravitational pull from the
planet. This difference in gravitational pull is a tidal force that
tends to keep the particles separated.
(We discussed tidal forces in detail Tidal forces prevent the
in Section 4-8. You may want to rematerial of Saturn’s
view that section, and in particular
rings from coalescing
Figure 4-24.)
The closer a pair of particles is into a moon
to the planet, the greater the tidal
force that tries to pull the pair apart. At a certain distance from
the planet’s center, called the Roche limit, the disruptive tidal
force is just as strong as the gravitational force between the particles. (The concept of this limit was developed in the mid-1800s
by the French mathematician Edouard Roche.) Inside the Roche
limit, the tidal force overwhelms the gravitational pull between
neighboring particles, and these particles cannot accrete to form
a larger body. Instead, they tend to spread out into a ring around
the planet. (The Cosmic Connections figure on the next page depicts this process.) Indeed, most of Saturn’s system of rings visible in Figure 12-16 lies within the planet’s Roche limit.
All large planetary satellites are found outside their planet’s
Roche limit. If any large satellite were to come inside its planet’s
Roche limit, the planet’s tidal forces would cause the satellite to
break up into fragments. We will see in Chapter 14 that such a
catastrophic tidal disruption may be the eventual fate of Neptune’s large satellite, Triton.

CAUTION! It may seem that it would be impossible for any object to hold together inside a planet’s Roche limit. But the ring
particles inside Saturn’s Roche limit survive and do not break
apart. The reason is that the Roche limit applies only to objects
held together by the gravitational attraction of each part of the
object for the other parts. By contrast, the forces that hold a
rock or a ball of ice together are chemical bonds between the
object’s atoms and molecules. These chemical forces are much
stronger than the disruptive tidal force of a nearby planet, so the

To determine the sizes of the particles that make up Saturn’s
rings, astronomers analyzed the radio signals received from a
spacecraft as it passes behind the rings. How easily radio waves
can travel through the rings depends on the relationship between
the wavelength and the particle size. The results show that most
of the particles range in size from pebble-sized fragments about
1 cm in diameter to chunks about 5 m across, the size of large
boulders. Most abundant are snowball-sized particles about 10 cm
in diameter.

Jupiter’s Main Ring This Galileo image shows Jupiter’s main
ring almost edge-on. The ring’s outer radius, about 129,000 km
from the center of Jupiter, is close to the orbit of Adrastea, the second
closest (after Metis) of Jupiter’s moons. Not shown is an even larger and
even more tenuous pair of “gossamer rings,” one of which extends out to

University)

rock or ball of ice does not break apart. In the same way, people walking around on the Earth’s surface (which is inside the
Earth’s Roche limit) are in no danger of coming apart, because
we are held together by comparatively strong chemical forces
rather than gravity.

Jupiter’s Ring and the Roche Limit
When the Voyager 1 spacecraft flew past Jupiter in 1979, it
trained its cameras not just on the planet but also on the space
around the planet’s equator. It discovered that Jupiter, too, has a
system of rings that lies within its Roche limit (Figure 12-18).
These rings differ from Saturn’s in two important ways. First,
Jupiter’s rings are composed of tiny particles of rock with an average size of only about 1 ␮m (⫽ 0.001 mm ⫽ 10⫺6 m) and that
reflect less than 5% of the sunlight that falls on them. Second,
there is very little material in the rings of Jupiter, less than
1/100,000 (10⫺5) the amount of material in Saturn’s rings. As a
result, Jupiter’s rings are extremely faint, which explains why
their presence was first revealed by a spacecraft rather than an
Earth-based telescope. The ring particles are thought to originate
from meteorite impacts on Jupiter’s four small, inner satellites,
two of which are visible in Figure 12-18.
We will see in Chapter 14 that the rings of Uranus and Neptune are also made of many individual particles orbiting inside
each planet’s Roche limit. Like the rings of Jupiter, these rings are
quite dim and difficult to see from Earth.

12-10 Saturn’s rings consist of thousands
of narrow, closely spaced ringlets
The photograph in Figure 12-1b, which was made in 1974, indicates what astronomers understood about the structure of Saturn’s rings in the mid-1970s. Each of the A, B, and C rings
appeared to be rather uniform, with little or no evidence of any
internal structure. Within a few years, however, close-up observations from spacecraft revealed the true complexity of the rings,
as well as their chemical composition.

If a small moon wanders too close to a planet, tidal forces tear the
moon into smaller particles. These particles form a ring around the
planet. The critical distance from the planet at which this happens
is called the Roche limit. This helps us understand why the rings of
Jupiter and Saturn are made of small particles, as are the rings of
Uranus and Neptune (discussed in Chapter 14).

Pioneer 11, Voyager 1, and Voyager 2 recorded images of Saturn’s rings during their flybys in 1979, 1980, and 1981 respectively. Pioneer 11 had only a relatively limited capability to make
images, but cameras on board the two Voyager spacecraft sent
back a number of pictures showing the detailed structure of Saturn’s rings. Since entering Saturn orbit in 2004, the Cassini spacecraft has provided scientists with even higher-resolution images of
the rings.
Figure 12-19 shows a Voyager 1 image. Some of the features
seen in this image were expected, including the Encke gap, a
270-km-wide division in the outer A ring observed by the German astronomer Johann Franz Encke in 1838. But to the amazement of scientists, images like the one in Figure 12-19 revealed
that the broad A, B, and C rings are not uniform at all but instead consist of hundreds upon hundreds of closely spaced bands
or ringlets. These ringlets are arrangements of ring particles that
have evolved from the combined gravitational forces of neighboring particles, of Saturn’s moons, and of the planet itself.
Pioneer 11 first detected the narrow F ring, which you can see
in Figure 12-19. It is only about 100 km wide and lies 4000 km
beyond the outer edge of the A ring. Close-up views from the
Voyagers and Cassini show that the F ring is made up of several
narrow ringlets. Small moons that orbit close to the F ring exert
gravitational forces on the ring particles, thus warping and deforming these ringlets (Figure 12-20).

Saturn’s F ring (compare Figure 12-19). The bright central
ringlet is about 50 km wide. As the small satellite Prometheus orbits
just inside the F ring, its gravitational pull causes disturbances called
“drapes” in the ringlets. The narrowness of the F ring is the result of
gravitational forces exerted by Prometheus and another small satellite
called Pandora (see Section 12-11). This image also shows two divisions
in the A ring, the Encke gap and the Keeler gap. (NASA/JPL/Space

Details of Saturn’s Rings The colors in this Voyager 1 image have been

the rings. The broad Cassini division is clearly visible, as is the narrow

the sunlit side of the rings. From this perspective, the B ring appears very bright, the A ring moderately bright, the C ring dim,
and the Cassini division dark (see Figure 12-19). The fraction of
sunlight reflected back toward the Sun (the albedo) is directly related to the concentration and size of the particles in the ring. The
B ring is bright because it has a high concentration of relatively
large, icy, reflective particles, whereas the darker Cassini division
has a lower concentration of such particles.
The Voyagers and Cassini have expanded our knowledge of
the ring particles by imaging the shaded side of the rings, which
cannot be seen from Earth. Figure 12-21 shows such an image.
Because the spacecraft was looking back toward the Sun, this
picture shows sunlight that has passed through the rings. The B
ring looks darkest in this image because little sunlight gets
through its dense collection of particles. If the Cassini division
were completely empty, it would look black, because we would
then see through it to the blackness of empty space. But the
Cassini division looks bright in Figure 12-21. This shows that
the Cassini division is not empty but contains a relatively small

The View from the Far Side of Saturn’s Rings This false-color view of
the side of the rings away from the Sun was taken by Voyager 1. The
Cassini division appears white, not black like the empty gap between the
A and F rings. Hence, the Cassini division cannot be empty, but must
contain a number of relatively small particles that scatter sunlight like
dust motes. (NASA/JPL)

number of particles. (In the same way, dust particles in the air
in your room become visible when a shaft of sunlight passes
through them.)
The process by which light bounces off particles in its path is
called light scattering. The proportion of light scattered in various directions depends upon both the size of the particles and the
wavelength of the light. (See Box 5-4 for examples of light scattering on Earth.) Because visible light has a much smaller wavelength than radio waves, light scattering allows scientists to
measure the sizes of particles too small to detect using the radio
technique described in Section 12-10. As an example, by measuring the amount of light scattered from the rings at various wave-

lengths and from different angles as the two Voyager spacecraft
sped past Saturn, scientists showed that the F ring contains a substantial number of tiny particles about 1 ␮m (⫽ 10–6 m) in diameter. This is about the same size as the particles found in smoke.
There are also subtle differences in color from one ring to
the next, as the computer-enhanced image in Figure 12-22 shows.
Although the main chemical constituent of the ring particles is
frozen water, trace amounts of other chemicals—perhaps coating the surfaces of the ice particles—are probably responsible
for the different colors. These trace chemicals have not yet been
identified.
The color variations in Figure 12-22 suggest that the icy particles do not migrate substantially from one ringlet to another.
Had such migration taken place, the color differences would have
been smeared out over time. The
color differences may also indicate

chemical composition
In this scenario, the rings did not all
form at the same time as Saturn but
were added to over an extended period. New ring material could
have come from small satellites that shattered after being hit by a
stray asteroid or comet.

Discovering New Ring Systems
In addition to revealing new details about the A, B, C, and F
rings, the Voyager cameras also discovered three new ring systems: the D, E, and G rings. The drawing in Figure 12-23 shows
the layout of all of Saturn’s known rings along with the orbits of
some of Saturn’s satellites. The D ring is Saturn’s innermost ring
system. It consists of a series of extremely faint ringlets located
between the inner edge of the C ring and the Saturnian cloudtops.
The E ring and the G ring both lie far from the planet, well beyond the narrow F ring. Both of these outer ring systems are extremely faint, fuzzy, and tenuous. Each lacks the ringlet structure
so prominent in the main ring systems. The E ring encloses the
orbit of Enceladus, one of Saturn’s icy satellites. Some scientists
suspect that water geysers on Enceladus are the source of ice particles in the E ring, much as Io’s volcanoes supply material to
Jupiter’s magnetosphere (see Section 12-8).

12-11 Saturn’s inner satellites affect the
appearance and structure of its rings
Why do Saturn’s rings have such a complex structure? The answer is that, like any object in the universe, the particles that
make up the rings are affected by the force of gravity. Saturn’s
gravitational pull keeps the ring particles in orbit around the
planet. But the satellites of Saturn also exert gravitational forces
on the rings. These forces can shape the orbits of the ring particles and help give rise to the rings’ structure.

confirmed by spacecraft flybys.

of the two satellites, moves around Saturn at a slightly slower
speed than the particles in the ring. As ring particles pass Pandora, they experience a tiny gravitational tug that slows them

Resonance and Shepherd Satellites
Astronomers have long known that one of Saturn’s moons,
Mimas, has a gravitational effect on its ring system. Mimas is a
moderate-sized satellite that orbits Saturn every 22.6 hours. According to Kepler’s third law, ring particles in the Cassini division
should orbit Saturn approximately every 11.3 hours. Consequently, a given set of ring particles in the Cassini division will
find itself between Saturn and Mimas on every second orbit (that
is, every 22.6 hours). In other words, particles in the Cassini division are in a 2-to-1 resonance with Mimas. Because of these repeated alignments, the combined gravitational forces of Saturn
and Mimas cause small particles to deviate from their original orbits, sweeping them out of the Cassini division. This helps explain
why the Cassini division is relatively empty (although not completely so, as Figure 12-21 shows).
While Mimas tends to spread ring particles apart, other satellites exert gravitational forces that herd particles together. The
Voyager spacecraft discovered two such satellites orbiting on ei-

Daphnis and the Keeler Gap This Cassini
spacecraft shows Saturn’s tiny moon Daphnis
orbiting within the Keeler gap (see also Figure 12-20).
Although it is just 7 km across, Daphnis exerts enough
gravitational force to keep the 42-km wide gap open and
induce wavelike disturbances in the two edges of the gap.

down slightly. Hence, these particles lose a little energy and fall
into orbits a bit closer to Saturn. At the same time, Prometheus,
the inner satellite, orbits the planet somewhat faster than the F
ring particles. The gravitational pull of Prometheus makes the
ring particles speed up a little, giving them some extra energy and
nudging them into slightly higher orbits. The competition between the pulls exerted by these two satellites focuses the F ring
particles into a well-defined, narrow band.
Because of their confining influence, Prometheus and Pandora are called shepherd satellites. We will see in Chapter 14 that
Uranus is encircled by narrow rings that are likewise kept confined by shepherd satellites.
An effect similar to shepherding explains two divisions in the
A ring, the Encke gap and the even narrower Keeler gap (Figure
12-20). In 2005, Cassini images revealed a miniature moon, Daphnis, which actually orbits inside the Keeler gap (Figure 12-25). In
a fashion similar to the F ring’s shepherds, Daphnis’s gravitational forces cause ring particles outside its orbit to move farther out and Gravitational effects
cause those inside its orbit to move
carve gaps in the rings
farther inward toward Saturn. In this
way, Daphnis helps to maintain a and focus ring particles
gap in the rings that is 42 km (26 into narrow ringlets
mi) wide, many times wider than
Daphnis’s 7-km (4-mi) diameter. In a similar way, a 20-km wide
moon called Pan orbits within and maintains the 270-km wide
Encke gap. Both of these moons cause wavelike disturbances in
the ring material on either side of the gap through which they
travel (see Figure 12-25).
In addition to their dynamic ring systems, Jupiter and Saturn
together have an exotic collection of moons. These include Saturn’s moon Titan, with a thick atmosphere rich in hydrocarbons;
Jupiter’s satellite Io, the most volcanic world in the solar system;
and Saturn’s satellite Enceladus, which has exotic geysers that
spew a mixture of water vapor and ice. We will examine these
alien worlds in Chapter 13.

Key Ideas
Composition and Structure: Jupiter and Saturn are both much
larger than Earth. Each is composed of 71% hydrogen, 24% helium, and 5% all other elements by mass. Both planets have a
higher percentage of heavy elements than does the Sun.
• Jupiter probably has a rocky core several times more massive
than the Earth. The core is surrounded by a layer of liquid “ices”
(water, ammonia, methane, and associated compounds). On top
of this is a layer of helium and liquid metallic hydrogen and an
outermost layer composed primarily of ordinary hydrogen and
helium. All of Jupiter’s visible features are near the top of this
outermost layer.
• Saturn’s internal structure is similar to that of Jupiter, but its
core makes up a larger fraction of its volume and its liquid metallic hydrogen mantle is shallower than that of Jupiter.
• Jupiter and Saturn both rotate so rapidly that the planets are
noticeably flattened. The rotation of both planets’ interiors is revealed by variations in the radio emissions from the planets.
• Both Jupiter and Saturn emit more energy than they receive
from the Sun. Presumably both planets are still cooling.

Atmospheres: The visible “surfaces” of Jupiter and Saturn are actually the tops of their clouds. The rapid rotation of the planets
twists the clouds into dark belts and light zones that run parallel
to the equator. Strong zonal winds run along the belts and zones.

Jupiter and Saturn: Lords of the Planets

• The outer layers of both planets’ atmospheres show differential
rotation: The equatorial regions rotate slightly faster than the polar regions. For both Jupiter and Saturn, the polar rotation rate
is nearly the same as the internal rotation rate.
• The colored ovals visible in the Jovian atmosphere represent gigantic storms. Some, such as the Great Red Spot, are quite stable
and persist for many years. Storms in Saturn’s atmosphere seem
to be shorter-lived.
• There are presumed to be three cloud layers in the atmospheres
of Jupiter and Saturn. The reasons for the distinctive colors of these
different layers are not yet known. The cloud layers in Saturn’s
atmosphere are spread out over a greater range of altitude than
those of Jupiter, giving Saturn a more washed-out appearance.

• Saturn’s atmosphere contains less helium than Jupiter’s atmosphere. This lower abundance may be the result of helium raining downward into the planet. Helium “rainfall” may also account
for Saturn’s surprisingly strong heat output.
Magnetic Fields and Magnetospheres: Jupiter has a strong magnetic field created by currents in the metallic hydrogen layer. Its
huge magnetosphere contains a vast current sheet of electrically
charged particles. Charged particles in the densest portions of
Jupiter’s magnetosphere emit synchrotron radiation at radio
wavelengths.
• The Jovian magnetosphere encloses a low-density plasma of
charged particles. The magnetosphere exists in a delicate balance
between pressures from the plasma and from the solar wind.
When this balance is disturbed, the size of the magnetosphere
fluctuates drastically.
• Saturn’s magnetic field and magnetosphere are much less extensive than Jupiter’s.
Rings: Saturn is circled by a system of thin, broad rings lying in
the plane of the planet’s equator. This system is tilted away from
the plane of Saturn’s orbit, which causes the rings to be seen at
various angles by an Earth-based observer over the course of a
Saturnian year.
Structure of the Rings: Saturn has three major, broad rings (A, B,
and C) that can be seen from Earth. Other, fainter rings were
found by the Voyager spacecraft.

• The principal rings of Saturn are composed of numerous particles of ice and ice-coated rock ranging in size from a few micrometers to about 10 m. Most of the rings exist inside the Roche
limit of Saturn, where disruptive tidal forces are stronger than the
gravitational forces attracting the ring particles to each other.

15.

• Each of Saturn’s major rings is composed of a great many narrow ringlets. The faint F ring, which is just outside the A ring, is
kept narrow by the gravitational pull of shepherd satellites.

17.

16.

• Jupiter’s faint rings are composed of a relatively small amount
of small, dark, rocky particles that reflect very little light.

Roughly speaking, Jupiter’s composition (by mass) is threequarters hydrogen and one-quarter helium. The mass of a
single hydrogen atom is given in Appendix 7; the mass of a
single helium atom is about 4 times greater. Use these numbers to calculate how many hydrogen atoms and how many
helium atoms there are in Jupiter.
Use the information given in Section 12-3 to estimate the
wind velocities in the Great Red Spot, which rotates with a

An astronaut floating above Saturn’s cloudtops would see a
blue sky, even though Saturn’s atmosphere has a very different chemical composition than Earth’s. Explain why. (Hint:
See Box 5-4.)
If Jupiter emitted just as much energy per second (as infrared
radiation) as it receives from the Sun, the average temperature of the planet’s cloudtops would be about 107 K. Given
that Jupiter actually emits twice this much energy per second,
calculate what the average temperature must actually be.
(a) From Figure 12-9a, by how much does the temperature

atmosphere to an altitude 100 km below that level? (b) Use
Figure 12-9b to answer the same question for Saturn’s atmosphere. (c) In the Earth’s troposphere (see Section 9-5), the
air temperature increases by 6.4°C for each kilometer that
you descend. In which planet’s atmosphere—Earth, Jupiter,
or Saturn—does the temperature increase most rapidly with
decreasing altitude?
Consider a hypothetical future spacecraft that would float,
suspended from a balloon, for extended periods in Jupiter’s
upper atmosphere. If we want this spacecraft to return to
Earth after completing its mission, calculate the speed at
which the spacecraft’s rocket motor would have to accelerate
it in order to escape Jupiter’s gravitational pull. Compare
with the escape speed from the Earth, equal to 11.2 km/s.
The Galileo Probe had a mass of 339 kg. On Earth, its weight

48. In the outermost part of Jupiter’s outer layer (shown in yellow in the upper part of Figure 12-12), hydrogen is principally in the form of molecules (H2). Deep within the liquid
metallic hydrogen layer (shown in orange in Figure 12-12),
hydrogen is in the form of single atoms. Recent laboratory
experiments suggest that there is a gradual transition between
these two states, and that the transition layer overlaps the
boundary between the ordinary hydrogen and liquid metallic
hydrogen layers. Use this information to redraw the upper
part of Figure 12-12 and to label the following regions in
Jupiter’s interior: (i) ordinary (nonmetallic) hydrogen molecules; (ii) nonmetallic hydrogen with a mixture of atoms and
molecules; (iii) liquid metallic hydrogen with a mixture of
atoms and molecules; (iv) liquid metallic hydrogen atoms.
49. When Saturn is at different points in its orbit, we see different
aspects of its rings because the planet has a 27° tilt. If the tilt
angle were different, would it be possible to see the upper and
lower sides of the rings at all points in Saturn’s orbit? If so,
what would the tilt angle have to be? Explain your answers.

he delicately colored world shown here is neither the
creation of an abstract artist nor the product of a science fiction writer’s imagination. It is Enceladus, a satellite of Saturn whose icy surface has a split personality: One
hemisphere is ancient and covered with impact craters, while
the other hemisphere is nearly crater-free and crisscrossed by
stress faults and fractures. The latter hemisphere is actually
the site of active volcanoes that eject icy particles rather
than lava.
Enceladus is not the only satellite of the giant planets to display exotic geologic activity. Io, a large satellite of Jupiter discovered by Galileo in 1610, is the most geologically active world in
the solar system. Its surface is covered with colorful sulfur compounds deposited by dozens of active volcanoes. Europa, another
of Jupiter’s large satellites, has no volcanoes but does have a
weirdly cracked surface of ice. Beneath Europa’s ice there may be
a worldwide ocean, within which there could possibly be singlecelled organisms.
No less exotic is Saturn’s large satellite Titan, which is enveloped by a thick, nitrogen-rich atmosphere from which liquid

Synchronous Rotation
The brightness of each satellite varies slightly as it orbits Jupiter.
This is because the satellites also spin on their axes as they orbit
Jupiter, and dark and light areas on their surfaces are alternately
exposed to and hidden from our view. Remarkably, each Galilean
satellite goes through one complete cycle of brightness during one
orbital period. This tells us that each satellite is in synchronous
rotation, so that it rotates exactly once on its axis during each trip
around its orbit (see Figure 3-4b). As we saw in Section 4-8, our
Moon’s synchronous rotation is the result of gravitational forces
exerted on the Moon by Earth. Likewise, Jupiter’s gravitational
forces keep the Galilean satellites in synchronous rotation.

TION
MA

Synchronous rotation means that the rotation period
and orbital period are in a 1-to-1 ratio for each Galilean
satellite. Remarkably, there is also a simple ratio of the
different orbital periods of the three inner Galilean satellites, Io,
Europa, and Ganymede. During the 7.155 days that Ganymede
takes to complete one orbit around Jupiter, Europa makes two
orbits and Io makes four orbits. Thus, the orbital periods of Io,
Europa, and Ganymede are in the ratio 1:2:4, which you can verify from the data in Table 13-1.
This special relationship among the satellites’ orbits is maintained by the gravitational forces that they exert on one another.
Those forces can be quite strong, because the three inner Galilean
satellites pass relatively close to one
another; at their closest approach, Gravitational interactions
Io and Europa are separated by only
between Io, Europa, and
two-thirds the distance from the
Ganymede induce a
Earth to the Moon. Such a close approach occurs once for every two of rhythmic relationship
Io’s orbits, so Europa’s gravitational among their orbits
pull acts on Io in a rhythmic way.
Indeed, Io, Europa, and Ganymede all exert rhythmic gravitational tugs on one another. Just as a drummer’s rhythm keeps
musicians on the same beat, this gravitational rhythm maintains
the simple ratio of orbital periods among the satellites.
By contrast, Callisto orbits at a relatively large distance from
the other three large satellites. Hence, the gravitational forces on
Callisto from the other satellites are relatively weak, and there is
no simple relationship between Callisto’s orbital period and the
period of Io, Europa, or Ganymede.

order to curry the favor of a wealthy Florentine patron of the arts
and sciences. We now call them the Galilean satellites. Individually, they are named Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto, after
four mythical lovers and companions of the god whom the Greeks
called Zeus and the Romans called Jupiter.
When viewed through an Earth-based telescope, the Galilean
satellites look like pinpoints of light (see Figure 4-16). All four
satellites orbit Jupiter in nearly the same plane as the planet’s
equator (Figure 13-1). From Earth, we always see that plane
nearly edge-on, so the satellites appear to move back and forth
relative to Jupiter (see Figure 4-17). The orbital periods are fairly
short, ranging from 1.8 (Earth) days for Io to 16.7 days for Callisto, so we can easily see the satellites move from one night to
the next and even during a single night. These motions led Galileo
to realize that he was seeing objects orbiting around Jupiter, in
much the same way that Copernicus said that planets move around
the Sun (see Section 4-2).
Each of the four Galilean satellites is bright enough to be visible to the naked eye. Why, then, did Galileo need a telescope to
discover them? The reason is that as seen from the Earth, the angular separation between Jupiter and the satellites is quite small—
never more than 10 arcminutes for Callisto and even less for the
other three Galilean satellites. To the naked eye, these satellites
are lost in the overwhelming glare of Jupiter. But a small telescope
or even binoculars increases the apparent angular separation by
enough to make the Galilean satellites visible.

orientation of the orbits depends on the relative positions of Earth and
Jupiter.

Transits, Eclipses, and Occultations
Because the orbital planes of the Galilean satellites are nearly
edge-on to our line of sight, we see these satellites undergoing
transits, eclipses, and occultations. In a transit, a satellite passes
between us and Jupiter, and we see the satellite’s shadow as a
black dot against the planet’s colorful cloudtops. (Figure 12-2a
shows Europa’s shadow on Jupiter.) In an eclipse, one of the
satellites disappears and then reappears as it passes into and out
of Jupiter’s enormous shadow. In an occultation, a satellite passes

completely behind Jupiter, and the satellite is temporarily blocked
from our Earth-based view. (The word occultation comes from a
Latin verb meaning “to cover.”)
Before spacecraft first ventured to Jupiter, astronomers used
eclipses to estimate the diameters of the Galilean satellites. When
a satellite emerges from Jupiter’s shadow, it does not blink on instantly. Instead, there is a brief interval during which the satellite
gets progressively brighter as more of its surface is exposed to
sunlight. The satellite’s diameter is calculated from the duration
of this interval and the satellite’s orbital speed (which is known
from Kepler’s laws).
Occultations can also be used to determine the diameter of
a satellite by measuring the time it takes to disappear behind

Jupiter or to reappear from behind the planet. In addition, the
Galilean satellites occasionally occult one another, because all
four orbit Jupiter in the plane of the planet’s equator. Every six
years, when the Earth passes through this equatorial plane, there
is a period of a few months during which Earth observers can
see mutual occultations of the satellites. Once again, timing the
occultations enables astronomers to calculate the diameters of
the satellites.
As Table 13-1 shows, the smallest Galilean satellite (Europa)
is slightly smaller than our Moon; the largest satellite (Ganymede)
is larger than Mercury and more than three-quarters the size of
Mars. Thus, the Galilean satellites truly are worlds in their own
right.

3.3

Even the finest images made with Earth-based telescopes have revealed relatively few details about the
Galilean satellites. Almost everything we know about
these satellites has come from observations made at close range
by spacecraft.
The first close-range observations of the Galilean satellites
were made by the Pioneer 10 and Pioneer 11 spacecraft as they
flew past Jupiter in 1973 and 1974. The images from these missions were of relatively low resolution, however, and much more
information has come from three subsequent missions. Voyager 1
and Voyager 2 flew past Jupiter in 1979 and recorded tens of
thousands of images, one of which is shown in Figure 13-2. The
Galileo spacecraft, which made 35 orbits around Jupiter between
1995 and 2003, carried out an even more extensive investigation
of Jupiter’s satellites.

Measuring Satellite Densities
One key goal of these missions was to determine the densities of
the Galilean satellites to very high accuracy. Given the density of
a planet or satellite, astronomers can draw conclusions about its
chemical composition and internal structure. To find the densities, scientists first determined the satellite masses. They did this
by measuring how the gravity of Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto deflected the trajectories of the Voyager and Galileo spacecraft. Given the masses and diameters of the satellites, they then
calculated each satellite’s average density (mass divided by volume). Table 13-1 lists our current knowledge about the sizes and
masses of the Galilean satellites.
Of the four Galilean satellites, Europa proves to be the least
massive: Its mass is only two-thirds that of our Moon. Ganymede

is by far the most massive of the four, with more than double the
mass of our Moon. In fact, Ganymede is the most massive satellite anywhere in the solar system. In second place is Callisto, with
about 11⁄2 times the Moon’s mass.
However, Ganymede and Callisto are not merely larger versions of our Moon. The reason is that both Ganymede and
Callisto have very low average densities of less than 2000 kg/m3.
By comparison, typical rocks in the Earth’s crust have densities
around 3000 kg/m3, and the average density of our Moon is
3344 kg/m3. The low densities of
Ganymede and Callisto mean that Three of the Galilean
these satellites cannot be composed
satellites are made of a
primarily of rock. Instead, they are
probably roughly equal parts of rock mixture of ice and rock;
and water ice. Water ice is substan- only Io is ice-free
tially less dense than rock, but it becomes as rigid as rock under high pressure (such as is found in
the interiors of the Galilean satellites). Furthermore, water molecules are relatively common in the solar system. Enough water
would have been available in the early solar system to make up
a substantial portion of a large satellite such as Ganymede or
Callisto.
Water ice cannot be a major constituent of the two inner
Galilean satellites, however. The innermost satellite, Io, has the
highest average density, 3529 kg/m3, slightly greater than the density of our Moon. The next satellite out, Europa, has an average
density of 3018 kg/m3. Both of these values are close to the densities of typical rocks in the Earth’s crust. Hence, it is reasonable
to suppose that both Io and Europa are made primarily of rocky
material.
The most definitive evidence for water ice on Jupiter’s satellites has come from spectroscopic observations. The spectra of
sunlight reflected from Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto show absorption at the infrared wavelengths characteristic of water ice
molecules. You can see this in Figure 7-4, which compares the
spectrum of Europa to the spectrum of ice. Europa’s density
shows that it is composed mostly of rock, so its ice must be limited to the satellite’s outer regions. Among the Galilean satellites,
only Io shows no trace of water ice on its surface or in its interior.

Io and Europa from Voyager 1 Voyager 1 recorded this image of
Jupiter and the Galilean satellites Io and Europa in February 1979, when it
was 20 million kilometers (12.4 million miles) from the giant planet. The
satellites are actually smaller than some of Jupiter’s cloud features, such
as the Great Red Spot (see Section 14-3). Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 also
recorded many images of the Galilean satellites at closer range. (NASA/JPL)

As Table 13-1 shows, the more distant a Galilean satellite is from
Jupiter, the greater the proportion of ice within the satellite and
the lower its average density. But why should this be? An important clue is that the average densities of the planets show a similar trend: Moving outward from the Sun, the average density of
the planets steadily decreases, from more than 5000 kg/m3 for
Mercury to less than 1000 kg/m3 for
Saturn (recall Table 7-1). The best The differences in
explanation for this similarity is that composition among the
the Galilean satellites formed around Galilean satellites mimic
Jupiter in much the same way that those among planets
the planets formed around the Sun,
orbiting the Sun
although on a much smaller scale.

In the inner parts of both the

rocky grains survive…

Proto-Jupiter

Protosun

…while in the outer reaches
of these nebulae, both ice
and rocky grains survive.

Figure 13-3
Formation of the Galilean Satellites Heat from the protosun made it
impossible for icy grains to survive within the innermost 2.5 to 4 AU of
the solar nebula. In the same way, Jupiter’s heat evaporated any icy
grains that were too close to the center of the “Jovian nebula.” Hence, the
two inner Galilean satellites were formed primarily from rock, while the
outer two incorporated both rock and ice.

The analogy between the solar nebula and the “Jovian nebula” is not exact. Unlike the Sun, Jupiter is a “failed star.” Its internal temperatures and pressures never became high enough to
ignite nuclear reactions that convert hydrogen into helium.
(Jupiter’s mass would have had to be about 80 times larger for
these reactions to have begun.) Furthermore, the icy worlds that
formed in the outer region of the “Jovian nebula”—namely,
Ganymede and Callisto—were of relatively small mass. Hence,
they were unable to attract gas from the nebula and become Jovian planets in their own right. Nonetheless, it is remarkable how
the main processes of “planet” formation seem to have occurred
twice in our solar system: once in the solar nebula around the
Sun, and once in microcosm in the gas cloud around Jupiter.
The diverse densities of the Galilean satellites suggest that
these four worlds may be equally diverse in their geology. This
turns out to be entirely correct. Because each of the Galilean satellites is unique, we devote the next several sections to each satellite in turn.

Before the two Voyager spacecraft flew past Jupiter,
the nature of Io was largely unknown. On the basis of
Io’s size and density, however, it was expected that Io
would be a world much like our own Moon—geologically dead,
with little internal heat available to power tectonic or volcanic activity (see Section 7-6). Hence, it was thought that Io’s surface
would be extensively cratered, because there would have been little geologic activity to erase those craters over the satellite’s
history.
Io proved to be utterly different from these naive predictions.
On March 5, 1979, Voyager 1 came within 21,000 kilometers
(13,000 miles) of Io and began sending back a series of bizarre
and unexpected pictures of the satellite (Figure 13-4). These images showed that Io has no impact craters at all! Instead, the surface is pockmarked by irregularly shaped pits and is blotched
with color.
The scientists were seeing confirmation of a prediction published in the journal Science just three days before Voyager 1 flew
past Io. In this article, Stanton Peale of the University of California, Santa Barbara, and Patrick Cassen and Ray Reynolds of
NASA’s Ames Research Center reported their conclusion that Io’s
interior must be kept hot by Jupiter’s tidal forces, and that this
should lead to intense volcanic activity.
3.4

We saw in Section 8-4 that dust grains in the solar nebula
played an important role in planet formation. In the inner parts
of the nebula, close to the glowing protosun, only dense, rocky
grains were able to survive. These accumulated over time into the
dense, rocky inner planets. But in the cold outer reaches of the
nebula, dust grains were able to retain icy coatings of low-density
material like water and ammonia. Hence, when the Jovian planets formed in the outer solar nebula and incorporated these icecoated grains, the planets ended up with both rock and ices in
their cores as well as substantial amounts of ammonia and water
throughout their interiors and atmospheres (see Section 14-1 and
Section 14-6).
As Jupiter coalesced, the gas accumulating around it formed
a rotating “Jovian nebula.” The central part of this nebula became the huge envelope of hydrogen and helium that makes up
most of Jupiter’s bulk. But in the outer parts of this nebula, dust
grains could have accreted to form small solid bodies. These grew
to become the Galilean satellites.
Although the “Jovian nebula” was far from the protosun, not
all of it was cold. Jupiter, like the protosun, must have emitted
substantial amounts of radiation due to Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction, which we discussed in Section 8-3. (We saw in Section
12-4 that even today, Jupiter emits more energy due to its internal heat than it absorbs from sunlight.) Hence, temperatures very
close to Jupiter must have been substantially higher than at locations farther from the planet. Calculations show that only rocky
material would condense at the orbital distances of Io and Europa, but frozen water could be retained and incorporated into
satellites at the distances of Ganymede and Callisto. In this way
Jupiter ended up with two distinct classes of Galilean satellites
(Figure 13-3).

333

Tidal Heating on Io
As we saw in Section 4-8, tidal forces are differences in the gravitational pull on different parts of a planet or satellite. These
forces tend to deform the shape of the planet or satellite (see Figure 4-25). Io, for example, is somewhat distorted from a spherical shape by tidal forces from Jupiter. If Io were in a perfectly
circular orbit so that it traveled around Jupiter at a steady speed,
Io’s rotation would always be in lockstep with its orbital motion.
In this case, Io would be in perfect synchronous rotation, with its
long axis always pointed directly toward Jupiter. But as Io moves

Io’s Active Volcanoes

The Nature of Io’s Volcanic Eruptions
An important clue about volcanism on Io came from the infrared
spectrometers aboard Voyager 1, which detected abundant sulfur
and sulfur dioxide in Io’s volcanic plumes. This led to the idea
that the plumes are actually more like geysers than volcanic eruptions. In a geyser on Earth, water seeps down to volcanically
heated rocks, where it changes to steam and erupts explosively
through a vent. Planetary geologists Susan Kieffer, Eugene Shoemaker, and Bradford Smith suggested that sulfur dioxide rather
than water could be the principal propulsive agent driving volcanic plumes on Io. Sulfur dioxide is a solid at the frigid temperatures found on most of Io’s surface, but it should be molten at
depths of only a few kilometers. Just as the explosive conversion
of water into steam produces a geyser on the Earth, the conversion of liquid sulfur dioxide into a high-pressure gas could result
in eruption velocities of up to 1000 m/s.

Io’s dramatic coloration (see Figure 13-4) is probably
due to sulfur and sulfur dioxide, which are ejected in
volcanic plumes and later fall back to the surface. Sulfur is normally bright yellow, which explains the dominant color
of Io’s surface. But if sulfur is heated and suddenly cooled, as
would happen if it were ejected from a volcanic vent and allowed
to fall to the surface, it can assume a range of colors from orange

No one expected that Voyager 1 would obtain images of erupting volcanoes on Io. After all, a spacecraft making a single trip
past the Earth would be highly unlikely to catch a large volcano
actually erupting. But, in fact, Voyager 1 images of Io revealed
eight different giant plumes of gas from volcanic eruptions. (Figure 13-5a shows two of these.) More recently, the Galileo spacecraft, which came as close as 200 km to Io’s surface during its
eight years in orbit around Jupiter, returned detailed images of

several such plumes (Figure 13-5b). These observations resoundingly confirm the Peale-Cassen-Reynolds prediction: Io is by far
the most volcanic world in the solar system.
Io’s volcanic plumes rise to astonishing heights of 70 to
280 km above Io’s surface. To reach such altitudes, the material
must emerge from volcanic vents with speeds between 300 and
1000 m/s (1100 to 3600 km/h, or 700 to 2200 mi/h). Even the
most violent terrestrial volcanoes have eruption speeds of only
around 100 m/s (360 km/h, or 220 mi/h). Scientists thus began to
suspect that Io’s volcanic activity must be fundamentally different
from volcanism here on Earth.

around its orbit, Europa and Ganymede exert gravitational tugs
on it in a regular, rhythmic fashion, thanks to the 1:2:4 ratio
among the orbital periods of these three satellites. These tugs distort Io’s orbit into an ellipse, and so its speed varies as it moves
around its orbit. Consequently, Io’s
long axis “nods” back and forth by

to this “nodding,” the tidal stresses
that Jupiter exerts on Io vary rhyth- volcanic nature
mically as Io moves around its orbit.
These varying tidal stresses alternately squeeze and flex Io. Just
as a ball of clay or bread dough gets warm as you knead it between your fingers, this squeezing and flexing causes tidal heating of Io’s interior. (The Earth’s Moon also “nods” as it orbits
our planet, but experiences almost no tidal heating because the
Earth’s tidal forces are very weak compared to those of massive
Jupiter.)
Tidal heating adds energy to Io at a rate of about 1014 watts,
equivalent to 24 tons of TNT exploding every second. As this energy makes its way to the satellite’s surface, it provides about
2.5 watts of power to each square meter of Io’s surface. By comparison, the average global heat flow through the Earth’s crust is
0.06 watts per square meter. Only in volcanically active areas on
Earth do we find heat flows that even come close to Io’s average.
Thus, Peale, Cassen, and Reynolds predicted “widespread and recurrent surface volcanism” on Io.

and red to black. Indeed, these colors are commonly found around
active volcanic vents (Figure 13-6). Whitish surface deposits (examine Figure 13-4 and Figure 13-6a), by contrast, are probably
due to sulfur dioxide (SO2). Volcanic vents on Earth commonly
discharge SO2 in the form of an acrid gas. But on Io, when hot
SO2 gas is released by an eruption into the cold vacuum of space,
it crystallizes into white snowflakes. This sulfur dioxide “snow”
then rains back onto Io’s surface.
The plumes are not the whole story of volcanism on Io, however. The sources of the plumes appear in Voyager images as
black spots 10 to 50 km in diameter, which are actually volcanic
vents (see Figure 13-4). Many of these black spots, which cover
5% of Io’s surface, are surrounded by dark lava flows. Figure 13-7
is a Galileo image of one of Io’s most active volcanic regions,
where in 1999 lava was found spouting to altitudes of thousands
of meters along a fissure 40 km (25 mi) in length. The glow from
this lava fountain was so intense that it was visible with Earth-

based telescopes. Thus, Io has two distinct styles of volcanic activity: unique geyserlike plumes and lava flows that are more dramatic versions of volcanic flows on Earth.
While sulfur and sulfur compounds are the key constituents
of Io’s volcanic plumes, the lava flows must be made of something else. Infrared measurements from the Galileo spacecraft
(Figure 13-8) show that lava flows on Io are at temperatures of
1700 to 2000 K (about 1450 to 1750°C, or 2600 to 3150°F). At
these temperatures sulfur could not remain molten but would
evaporate almost instantly. Io’s lavas are also unlikely to have the
same chemical composition as typical lavas on Earth, which have
temperatures of only 1300 to 1450 K. Instead, lavas on Io are
probably ultramafic lavas. These are enriched in magnesium and
iron, which give the lava a higher melting temperature.
Solidified ultramafic lavas are found on Earth, but primarily
in lava beds that formed billions of years ago when the Earth’s
interior was much hotter than today. The presence of molten

Io’s Lava Flows and a Curtain of Fire This mosaic of Galileo
spacecraft images shows a nested chain of volcanic calderas (pits) with
black lava flows. The red streak at upper left is a fissure in the surface
about 40 km (25 mi) long, through which lava is erupting upward in a
vertical sheet or curtain. The erupting lava reaches the amazing height of
1500 m (5000 ft). (University of Arizona/JPL/NASA)

ultramafic lava on Io suggests that its interior, too, is substantially
hotter than that of the present-day Earth. One model proposes
that Io has a 100-km (60-mi) thick crust floating atop a worldwide ocean of liquid magma 800 km (500 mi) deep. (As we saw
in Section 9-2, the mantle that lies underneath the Earth’s crust is

a plastic solid rather than a true liquid.) The global extent of this
“magma ocean” would explain why volcanic activity is found at
all points on Io’s surface, rather than being concentrated in pockets as on Earth (see Section 9-3). It could also explain the origin
of Io’s mountains, which reach heights up to 10 km (30,000 ft).
In this model, these mountains are blocks of Io’s crust that have
tilted before sinking into the depths of the magma ocean.
Io’s worldwide volcanic activity is remarkably persistent.
When Voyager 2 flew through the Jovian system in July 1979,
four months after Voyager 1, almost all of the volcanic plumes
seen by Voyager 1 were still active. And when Galileo first viewed
Io in 1996, about half of the volcanoes seen by the Voyager spacecraft were still ejecting material, while other, new volcanoes had
become active.
Io may have as many as 300 active volcanoes, each of which
ejects an estimated 10,000 tons of material per second. Altogether, volcanism on Io may eject as much as 1013 tons of matter each year. This is sufficient to cover the satellite’s entire surface
to a depth of 1 meter in a century, or to cover an area of 1000
square kilometers in a few weeks (see Figure 13-6). Thanks to this
continual “repaving” of the surface, there are probably no longlived features on Io, and any impact craters are quickly obliterated.

Most of the material ejected from Io’s volcanoes falls back onto

Io’s Glowing Volcanoes This false-color Galileo image

including Pele and Pillan (see Figure 13-6). These regions are substantially
hotter than typical lava flows on Earth. (Planetary Image Research
Laboratory/University of Arizona/JPL/NASA)

The Jovian magnetosphere contains charged particles, some of
which collide with Io and its volcanic plumes. The impact of these
collisions knocks ions out of the plumes and off the surface, and
these ions become part of Jupiter’s magnetosphere. Indeed, material from Io is the main source for Jupiter’s magnetosphere as a
whole. Some of the ejected material forms the Io torus, a huge
doughnut-shaped ring of ionized gas, or plasma (see Section 12-7),
that circles Jupiter at the distance of Io’s orbit. The plasma’s glow
can be detected from Earth (Figure 13-9a).
Jupiter’s magnetic field has
other remarkable effects on Io. As Jupiter and Io together
Jupiter rotates, its magnetic field ro- act like an immense
tates with it, and this field sweeps electric generator
over Io at high speed. This generates
a voltage of 400,000 volts across the satellite, which causes 5 million amperes of electric current to flow through Io.

The Io Torus (a) An Earth-based telescope recorded this falsecolor infrared image of Io’s plasma torus. Because of Jupiter’s
glare, only the outer edge of the torus could be photographed; an artist
added the visible-light picture of Jupiter and the yellow line indicating the

information is transmitted to the credit card company, which (it
is hoped) approves your purchase. An electric generator at a
power plant works in the same way. A coil of wire is moved
through a strong magnetic field, which makes current flow in
the coil. This current is delivered to transmission lines and eventually to your home.
In fact, a current flows not only through Io but also through the
sea of charged particles in Jupiter’s magnetosphere and through
Jupiter’s atmosphere. This forms a gigantic, oval-shaped electric
circuit that connects Io and Jupiter in the same way that wires
connect the battery and the lightbulb in a flashlight (Figure 13-9b).
Jupiter’s aurora, which we discussed in Section 12-7, is particularly strong at the locations where this current strikes the upper
atmosphere of Jupiter.
Part of the electric current that flows between Io and Jupiter
is made up of electrons that spiral around Jupiter’s magnetic field
lines. As they spiral, the electrons act like miniature antennas and
emit radio waves. This is the source of Jupiter’s bursts of decametric radio radiation, which we discussed in Section 12-7.

The electric current within and near Io also creates a weak magnetic field, which was first detected by Voyager 1. Remarkably,
measurements made by Galileo during its close approaches to Io
suggest that the magnetic field near Io may be too strong—
comparable to that of Mercury, although weaker than that of
Earth—to be generated by Io’s electric current alone. This has led
scientists to speculate that Io generates its own magnetic field
through the motions of molten material in its interior, just as the
Earth does (see Section 7-7 and Section 9-4). If these speculations
are correct, Io is the smallest world in the solar system to generate its own magnetic field.

Johnson, “The Galileo Mission to Jupiter and Its Moons,” Scientific American,
February 2000, p. 44)

If Io has undergone enough tidal heating to melt its interior,
chemical differentiation must have taken place and the satellite
should have a dense core. (We described chemical differentiation
in Box 7-1 and Section 8-4.) To test for this, scientists measured
how Io’s gravity deflected the trajectory of Galileo as the spacecraft flew past. From these measurements, they could determine
not only Io’s mass but also the satellite’s oblateness (how much
it deviates from a spherical shape because of its rotation). The
amount of oblateness indicates the size of the core; the greater the
fraction of the satellite’s mass contained in its core, the less oblate
the satellite will be. The Galileo observations suggest that Io has
a dense core composed of iron and iron sulfide (FeS), with a radius of about 900 km (about half the satellite’s overall radius).
Surrounding the core is a mantle of partially molten rock, on top
of which is Io’s visible crust.

Europa, the second of the Galilean satellites, is the
smoothest body in the solar system. There are no mountains and no surface features greater than a few hundred meters high (Figure 13-10). There are almost no craters,
indicating a young surface that has been reprocessed by geologic
activity. The dominant surface feature is a worldwide network of
stripes and cracks (Figure 13-11). Like Io, Europa is an exception
to the general rule that a small world should be cratered and geologically dead (see Section 7-6).

Europa Dark lines crisscross Europa’s smooth, icy surface in this falsecolor composite of visible and infrared images from Galileo. These are
fractures in Europa’s crust that can be as much as 20 to 40 km (12 to 25

made by Galileo. (Both Figure 13-10 and Figure 13-11 are Galileo
images.) But even before these spacecraft visited Jupiter, spectroscopic observations from Earth indicated that Europa’s surface is
almost pure frozen water (see Figure
7-4). This was confirmed by instru- Geology on Europa is
ments on board Galileo, which
based on solid ice and
showed that Europa’s infrared spectrum is a close match to that of a liquid water, not rock
thin layer of fine-grained water ice and molten magma
frost on top of a surface of pure water ice. (The brown areas in Figure 13-10 show where the icy surface contains deposits of rocky material from meteoritic impacts,
from Europa’s interior, or from a combination of these sources.)
The purity of Europa’s ice suggests that water is somehow
brought upward from the moon’s interior to the surface, where it
solidifies to make a fresh, smooth layer of ice. Indeed, some
Galileo images show what appear to be lava flows on Europa’s
surface, although the “lava” in this case is mostly ice. This idea
helps to explain why Europa has very few craters (any old ones
have simply been covered up) and why its surface is so smooth.
Europa’s surface may thus represent a water-and-ice version of
plate tectonics.
Although Europa’s surface is almost pure water ice, keep in
mind that Europa is not merely a giant ice ball. The satellite’s
density shows that rocky material makes up about 85 to 90% of

Europa’s mass. Hence, only a small fraction of the mass, about
10 to 15%, is water ice. Because the surface is icy, we can conclude that the rocky material is found within Europa’s interior.
Europa is too small to have retained much of the internal
heat that it had when it first formed. But there must be internal
heat nonetheless to power the geologic processes that erase craters
and bring fresh water to Europa’s surface. What keeps Europa’s
interior warm? The most likely answer, just as for Io, is heating
by Jupiter’s tidal forces. The rhythmic gravitational tugs exerted
by Io and Ganymede on Europa deform its orbit into an ellipse;
the varying speed of Europa as it goes around its orbit causes Europa to “nod” back and forth, causing variations in tidal stresses
that make Europa flex. But because it is farther from Jupiter, tidal
effects on Europa are only about one-fourth as strong as those on
Io, which may explain why no ongoing volcanic activity has yet
been seen on Europa.
Some features on Europa’s surface, such as the fracture patterns shown in Figure 13-11, may be the direct result of the crust
being stretched and compressed by tidal flexing. Figure 13-12
shows other features, such as networks of ridges and a young,
very smooth circular area, that were probably caused by the internal heat that tidal flexing generates. The rich variety of terrain
depicted in Figure 13-12, with stress ridges going in every direction, shows that Europa has a complex geologic history.
Among the unique structures found on Europa’s surface are
ice rafts. The area shown in Figure 13-13a was apparently subjected to folding, producing the same kind of linear features as
those in Figure 13-12. But a later tectonic disturbance broke the
surface into small chunks of crust a few kilometers across, which
then “rafted” into new positions. A similar sort of rafting hap-

pens in the Earth’s Arctic Ocean every spring, when the winter’s
accumulation of surface ice breaks up into drifting ice floes (Figure 13-13b). The existence of such structures on Europa strongly
suggests that there is a subsurface layer of liquid water or soft ice
over which the ice rafts can slide with little resistance.

The ridges, faults, ice rafts, and other features strongly suggest
that Europa has substantial amounts of internal heat. This heat
could prevent water from freezing beneath Europa’s surface, creating a worldwide ocean beneath the crust. If this picture is correct, geologic processes on Europa may be an exotic version of
those on Earth, with the roles of solid rock and molten magma
being played by solid ice and liquid water.
A future spacecraft may use radar to penetrate through Europa’s icy crust to search for definitive proof of liquid water beneath the surface. But magnetic field measurements made by the
Galileo spacecraft have already provided some key evidence favoring this picture. Unlike the Earth or Jupiter, Europa does not
seem to create a steady magnetic field of its own. But as Europa
moves through Jupiter’s intense magnetic field, electric currents
are induced within the satellite’s interior, just as they are within
Io (see Section 13-5), and these currents generate a weak but
measurable field. (The strength and direction of this induced field
vary as Europa moves through different parts of the Jovian
magnetosphere, which would not be the case if Europa generated
its field by itself.)
To explain these observations, there must be an electrically
conducting fluid beneath Europa’s crust—a perfect description of
an underground ocean of water with dissolved minerals. (Pure
water is a very poor conductor of electricity, so other substances
must be present to make the water conducting.) If some of this
water should penetrate upward to Europa’s surface through cracks
in the crust, it would vaporize and spread the dissolved minerals
across the terrain. This could explain the reddish-brown colors in
Figure 13-13a.

Ganymede is the largest satellite in our solar system
and is even larger than the planet Mercury. Like our
Moon, Ganymede has two distinct kinds of terrain,
called dark terrain and bright terrain (Figure 13-14). On the
Moon, the dark maria are younger than the light-colored lunar
highlands (see Section 10-1). On Ganymede, by contrast, the dark
terrain is older, as indicated by its higher density of craters. The
bright terrain is much less cratered and therefore younger. Because ice is more reflective than rock, even Ganymede’s dark terrain is substantially brighter than the lunar surface.
Voyager and Galileo images show noticeable differences between young and old impact craters on Ganymede. The youngest

By combining measurements of Europa’s induced magnetic
field, gravitational pull, and oblateness, scientists conclude that
Europa’s outermost 100 to 200 km are ice and water. (It is not
clear how much of this is liquid and how much solid.) Within this
outer shell is a rocky mantle surrounding a metallic core some
600 km (400 mi) in radius.
Remarkably, Europa also has an extremely thin atmosphere
of oxygen. (By Earth standards, this atmosphere would qualify as
a near-vacuum.) We saw in Section 9-5 that oxygen in the Earth’s
atmosphere is produced by plants through photosynthesis. But
Europa’s oxygen atmosphere is probably the result of ions from
Jupiter’s magnetosphere striking the satellite’s icy surface. These
collisions break apart water molecules, liberating atoms of hydrogen (which escape into space) and oxygen.
The existence of a warm, subsurface ocean on Europa, if
proved, would make Europa the only world in the solar system
other than the Earth on which there is liquid water. This would
have dramatic implications. On Earth, water and warmth are essentials for the existence of life. Perhaps single-celled organisms
have evolved in the water beneath Europa’s crust, where they
would use dissolved minerals and organic compounds as food
sources. In light of this possibility, NASA has taken steps to prevent biological contamination of Europa. At the end of the Galileo
mission in 2003, the spacecraft (which may have carried traces of
organisms from Earth) was sent to burn up in Jupiter’s atmosphere, rather than remaining in orbit where it might someday
crash into Europa. An appropriately sterilized spacecraft may one
day visit Europa and search for evidence of life within this exotic
satellite.

RI V UXG

Ganymede Two distinct types of terrain—one dark, heavily
cratered, and hence old, the other bright, less cratered, and
hence younger—are visible in this Galileo image of the hemisphere of
Ganymede that always faces away from Jupiter. Craters in general appear
bright, suggesting that the impacts that formed the craters excavated
the surface to reveal ice underneath. (NASA/JPL)

craters are surrounded by bright rays of freshly exposed ice
that has been excavated by the impact (see the lower left of Figure 13-14). Older craters are darker, perhaps because of chemical processes triggered by exposure to sunlight.
The close-up Galileo image in Figure 13-15 shows the contrast between dark and bright terrain. The area on the left-hand
side of this image is strewn with large and small craters, reinforcing the idea that the dark terrain is billions of years old. The dark
terrain is also marked by long, deep furrows. These are deformations of Ganymede’s crust that have partially erased some of the
oldest craters. Since other craters lie on top of the furrows, the
stresses that created the furrows must have occurred long ago.
Since geologic activity is a result of a planet or satellite’s internal
heat, this shows that Ganymede must have had a warm interior
in the distant past.
Linear features are also seen in the bright terrain on the right
in Figure 13-15. The Voyager missions discovered that the bright
terrain is marked by long grooves, some of which extend for hundreds of kilometers and are as much as a kilometer deep. Images
from Galileo show that some adjacent grooves run in different directions, indicating that the bright terrain has been subjected to a
variety of tectonic stresses. Galileo also found a number of small
craters overlying the grooves, some of which are visible in Figure
13-15. The density of craters shows that the bright terrain, while
younger than the dark terrain, is at least a billion years old.
After the Voyager missions, it was thought that the bright
terrain represented fresh ice that had flooded through cracks in

Evidence for Geologic Activity on Ganymede Stresses in Ganymede’s
crust have produced linear features that extend for hundreds of
kilometers across both the dark and bright terrain. These features must

Ganymede’s crust, analogous to the maria on our Moon (see Section 10-1). However, high-resolution Galileo images do not show
the kinds of surface features that would be expected if this terrain
was volcanic in origin. Yet there are several low-lying areas within
the bright terrain that appear to have been flooded by a watery
fluid that subsequently froze. These low-lying areas may be rift
valleys where the crust has been pulled apart, like Valles Marineris
on Mars (see Section 11-5). In order to flood the floors of these
valleys, there must have been liquid water beneath Ganymede’s
surface when the valleys formed. This is additional evidence that
Ganymede must have had a warm interior in the past, and that
this internal warmth persisted at least until the era when the
bright terrain formed a billion years ago. This is rather surprising, because Ganymede is too small to have retained much of the
heat left over from its formation or from radioactive elements,
and it orbits too far from Jupiter to have any substantial tidal
heating.

An equally great surprise from Galileo observations was the discovery that Ganymede has its own magnetic field, and that this
field is twice as strong as that of Mercury. This field is sufficiently
strong to trap charged particles, giving Ganymede its own “minimagnetosphere” within Jupiter’s much larger magnetosphere. The
presence of a magnetic field shows that electrically conducting
material must be in motion within Ganymede to act as a dynamo,
which means that the satellite must have substantial internal heat
even today. A warm interior causes differentiation, and Galileo
measurements indeed showed that Ganymede is highly differentiated. It has a metallic core some 500 km in radius, surrounded
by a rocky mantle and by an outer shell of ice some 800 km thick.
An even more surprising result is that Ganymede’s magnetic
field varies somewhat as it orbits Jupiter, and that these variations
are correlated with Ganymede’s location within Jupiter’s mag-

netic field. One explanation for this variation is that Ganymede
has a layer of salty, electrically conducting liquid water some
170 km beneath its surface. As the satellite moves through Jupiter’s
magnetic field, electric currents are induced in this layer just as
happens within Europa (see Section 13-6), and these currents generate a weak field that adds to the stronger field produced by
Ganymede’s dynamo.
A possible explanation for Ganymede’s internal heat is that
gravitational forces from the other Galilean satellites may have affected its orbit. While Ganymede’s present-day orbit around
Jupiter is quite circular, calculations show that the orbit could
have been more elliptical in the past. Just as for Io and Europa,
such an elliptical orbit would have given rise to substantial tidal
heating of Ganymede’s interior. It may have retained a substantial amount of that heat down to the present day.

Callisto’s Perplexing Surface

In marked contrast to Io, Europa, and Ganymede is
Callisto, Jupiter’s outermost Galilean satellite. Images
from Voyager showed that Callisto has numerous impact craters scattered over an icy crust (Figure 13-16). Callisto’s
ice is not as reflective as that on Europa or Ganymede, however;
the surface appears to be covered with some sort of dark mineral
deposit.

CAUTION! Figure 13-16, as well as the images that accompany
Table 13-1, shows that Callisto is the darkest of the Galilean
satellites. Nonetheless, its surface is actually more than twice as
reflective as that of our own Moon. Callisto’s surface may be
made of “dirty” ice, but even dirty ice reflects more light than
the gray rock found on the Moon. If you could somehow replace our own Moon with Callisto, a full moon as seen from
Earth would be 4 times brighter than it is now (thanks also in
part to Callisto’s larger size).

Close-up from Galileo

One curious discovery from Galileo is that while Callisto has
numerous large craters, there are very few with diameters less
than 1 km. Such small craters are abundant on Ganymede, which
has probably had the same impact history as Callisto. This implies that most of Callisto’s small craters have been eroded away.
How this could have happened is not known. Another surprising
result is that Callisto’s surface is covered by a blanket of dark,
dusty material (see the inset in Figure 13-16). Where this material
came from, and how it came to be distributed across the satellite’s surface, is not understood.

smallest craters in this close-up view have been completely obliterated,
and the terrain between the craters is blanketed by dark, dusty material.

The Voyager images led scientists to conclude that Callisto is a
dead world, with an ancient surface that has never been reshaped
by geologic processes. There is no simple relationship between
Callisto’s orbital period and those of the other Galilean satellites,
so it would seem that Callisto never experienced any tidal heating and hence was unable to power any geologic processes at its
surface. But once the Galileo spacecraft went into orbit around
Jupiter and began returning high-resolution images, scientists realized that Callisto’s nature is not so simple. In fact, Callisto
proves to be the most perplexing of the Galilean satellites.

Callisto’s most unexpected feature is that, like Europa and
Ganymede, it appears to have an induced magnetic field that
varies as the satellite moves through different parts of Jupiter’s
magnetosphere. Callisto must have a layer of electrically conducting material in order to generate such a field. One model suggests
that this material is in the form of a subsurface ocean like Europa’s but only about 10 km (6 mi) deep. However, without tidal
heating, Callisto’s interior is probably so cold that a layer of liquid water would quickly freeze. One proposed explanation is that
Callisto’s ocean is a mixture of water and a form of “antifreeze.”
In cold climates on Earth, antifreeze is added to the coolant in automobile radiators to lower the liquid’s freezing temperature and
prevent it from solidifying. Ammonia in Callisto’s proposed subsurface ocean could play the same role.
The presence of a liquid layer beneath Callisto’s surface is
difficult to understand. Even with ammonia acting as an antifreeze, this layer cannot be too cold or it would solidify. This
argues for a relatively warm interior. But Galileo measurements
suggest that Callisto’s interior is not highly differentiated. This

implies that the interior is cold, and may never have been heated
enough to undergo complete chemical differentiation. The full
story of Callisto’s interior, it would seem, has yet to be told.
Although Ganymede and Callisto have many differences, one
feature they share is an extremely thin and tenuous atmosphere.
The molecules that make up Ganymede’s atmosphere are oxygen
(O2) and ozone (O3). These are thought to be released from gas
bubbles trapped in Ganymede’s surface ice. On Callisto, by contrast, the atmosphere is composed of carbon dioxide (CO2). This
gas may have evaporated from Callisto’s poles, where temperatures are low enough to form CO2 ice.
The diagrams in Figure 13-17 summarize the probable interior structures of the Galilean satellites. They demonstrate the remarkable variety of these terrestrial worlds.

Unlike Jupiter, Saturn has only one large satellite that
is comparable in size to our own Moon. This satellite,
Titan, was discovered by Christiaan Huygens in 1665.
Titan’s diameter of 5150 km makes it second in size among satellites to Ganymede (Section 13.7). Like Ganymede, Titan has a
low density that suggests it is made of a mixture and ice and rock.
(See Table 7-2 for a comparison between Titan, the Moon, and
the Galilean satellites.) But unlike Ganymede or any other satellite in the solar system, Titan has a thick atmosphere with a
unique chemical composition.

Titan’s Atmosphere
By the early 1900s, scientists had begun to suspect that Titan
(Figure 13-18) might have an atmosphere, because it is cool
enough and massive enough to retain heavy gases. (Box 7-2 explains the criteria for a planet or satellite to retain an atmosphere.) These suspicions were confirmed in 1944, when Gerard

343

Kuiper discovered the spectral lines of methane in sunlight reflected from Titan. (We discussed Titan’s spectrum and its interpretation in Section 7-3.)
Because of its atmosphere, Titan was a primary target for the
Voyager missions. To the chagrin of mission scientists and engineers, however, Voyager 1 spent hour after precious hour of its
limited, preprogrammed observation time sending back featureless images like the one at the center of Figure 13-18. Titan’s
atmosphere is so thick—about 200 km (120 mi) deep, or about
10 times the depth of the Earth’s troposphere—that it blocked
Voyager’s view of the surface. The haze surrounding Titan is so
dense that little sunlight penetrates to the ground; noon on Titan
is only about 1/1000 as bright as noon on Earth, though still 350
times brighter than night on Earth under a full moon.
By examining how the radio signal from Voyager 1 was affected by passing through Titan’s atmosphere, scientists inferred
that the atmospheric pressure at Titan’s surface is 50% greater
than the atmospheric pressure at sea level on the Earth. Titan’s
surface gravity is weaker than that of Earth, so to produce this
pressure Titan must have considerably more gas in its atmosphere
than Earth. Indeed, calculations show that about 10 times more
gas (by mass) lies above a square meter of Titan’s surface than
above a square meter of Earth.
Voyager data show that more than 95% of Titan’s atmosphere is nitrogen. Most of this nitrogen probably came from ammonia (NH3), a compound of nitrogen and hydrogen that is quite
common in the outer solar system. Ammonia is easily broken into
hydrogen and nitrogen atoms by the Sun’s ultraviolet radiation.
Titan’s gravity is too weak to retain hydrogen atoms (see Box
7-2), so these atoms escape into space and leave the more massive nitrogen atoms behind.
The remainder of Titan’s atmosphere is predominantly
methane (CH4), which is the principal component of the “natural gas” used on Earth as fuel. The interaction of methane with
ultraviolet light from the Sun produces a variety of other carbonhydrogen compounds, or hydrocarbons. For example, the Voyager infrared spectrometers detected small amounts of ethane

(C2H6), acetylene (C2H2), ethylene (C2H4), and propane (C3H8)
in Titan’s atmosphere.
On Earth, water can be a gas (like water vapor in the atmosphere), a liquid (as in the oceans), or a solid (as in the polar ice
caps). On Titan, the atmospheric
pressure is so high and the surface A faint mist of methane
temperature is so low—about 95 K rain falls continually
(–178°C, or –288°F)—that any wa- on Titan
ter is frozen solid. But conditions on
Titan are just right for methane and ethane to exist as gases, liquids, or solids. This raises the tantalizing possibility that Titan
could have methane rain and lakes of liquid ethane.
Nitrogen in Titan’s atmosphere can combine with airborne
hydrocarbons to produce other compounds, such as hydrogen
cyanide (HCN). Hydrogen cyanide, along with other molecules,
can join together in long, repeating molecular chains to form substances called polymers. Droplets of some polymers remain suspended in the atmosphere, forming an aerosol. (Common aerosols
on the Earth include fog, mist, and paint sprayed from a can.) The
polymers in Titan’s airborne aerosol are thought to be responsible for the reddish-brown color seen in Figure 13-18.

Exploring Titan with Cassini and Huygens
The designers of the Cassini mission to Saturn made
the exploration of Titan a central goal. During its primary mission in Saturn orbit from 2004 to 2008, the

Cassini spacecraft will make 44 close flybys of Titan. Titan’s
atmosphere is more transparent to infrared wavelengths than to
visible light, so Cassini has used its infrared telescope to obtain
the first detailed images of the satellite’s surface (Figure 13-19a).
Most of the surface is light-colored, but a swath of dark terrain
extends around most of Titan’s equator.
Cassini has used its on-board radar to map the dark terrain.
(Like infrared light, radio waves can pass through Titan’s atmosphere.) These images reveal a series of long, parallel lines of sand
dunes about 1 to 2 km apart. These are aligned west to east, in
the same direction that winds blow at Titan’s equator, and so presumably formed by wind action. Unlike Earth sand, which is
made of small particles of silicate rock, sand on Titan is probably small particles of water ice combined with polymers that have
fallen from Titan’s atmosphere. These polymers give the dark terrain its color.
The infrared telescope aboard Cassini also detected a surface
feature that appears to be a volcano. The presence of volcanism
on Titan can explain why there is so much methane in the satellite’s atmosphere. Methane molecules are broken apart by ultraviolet photons from the Sun, and the hydrogen atoms escape into
space. This process would destroy all of Titan’s methane within
10 million years unless a fresh supply is added to the atmosphere
by volcanic activity. Volcanic activity can also explain the presence of isolated very bright patches on Titan’s surface (see Figure
13-19a). A volcanic eruption would outgas not just methane but

Jupiter and Saturn’s Satellites of Fire and Ice

also water vapor and carbon dioxide. These gases would quickly
freeze onto the surface, making a patch of highly reflective ice.
The most remarkable images of Titan’s surface have come
from Huygens, a small lander that Cassini carried on its journey
from Earth and released before entering Saturn orbit. Named for
the discoverer of Titan, Huygens entered Titan’s atmosphere on
January 14, 2005. The lander took 21⁄2 hours to descend to the surface under a parachute, during which time it made detailed
images of the terrain (see Figure 13-19b). After touchdown, Huygens continued to return data for another 70 minutes (see Figure
13-19c) before its batteries succumbed to Titan’s low temperatures.
Huygens images such as Figure 13-19b show that liquids
have indeed flowed on Titan like water on Earth. Yet none of the
images made by the lander during its descent or after touchdown
showed any evidence of standing liquid. There was nonetheless
evidence of recent methane rainfall at the Huygens landing site.
A lander instrument designed to measure atmospheric composition was equipped with a heater for its gas inlet. During the three
minutes it took to warm this inlet, the measured methane concentration jumped by 30% and then remained steady. The explanation is that the ground was soaked with liquid methane that had
fallen as rain and which evaporated as it was warmed by the
heater. Huygens measurements indicate that the average annual
methane rainfall on Titan is about 5 cm (2 in.), about the same
as the amount of water rain that falls each year at Death Valley
in California. The rivers and outflow channels that Huygens observed during its descent may date from an earlier period in Titan’s history when methane was more abundant and rainfall was
more intense.
Before the Cassini mission scientists expected to find lakes of
liquid ethane across Titan’s surface. As of this writing (2006) the
only location where Cassini appears to have located such lakes is
near Titan’s north pole (Figure 13-20). It is currently winter in
the northern hemisphere, so temperatures are lowest there. Scientists also expected to find extensive clouds of ethane in Titan’s
atmosphere; these, too, have only been found near the north pole.
Over the course of a Titan year (which, like that of its parent
planet Saturn, lasts 29.37 years) the supply of liquid ethane may
migrate with the seasons from pole to pole, much as frozen carbon dioxide migrates seasonally on Mars (see Section 11-6).
Impact craters are also conspicuously absent on Titan: Only
a handful of craters have been observed by Cassini. The majority

of craters may have been eroded by wind or rainfall, or covered
by material ejected from volcanoes.

Titan’s Geologic History
We have seen that Titan must have been volcanically active to
provide its atmosphere with methane. But what has powered the
volcanic activity? Titan is too small to have retained the internal
heat from its formation. Furthermore, although Titan’s rotation
is synchronous like that of Io, its orbit around Saturn is so circular that it cannot be heated by tidal flexing in the way that Io is
(see Section 13-4).
One explanation has been proposed by planetary scientists
Gabriel Tobie, Jonathan Lunine, and Christophe Sotin. In their
model, Titan developed a solid rocky core, a mantle of liquid water, and an icy crust soon after it formed some 4.5 billion years
ago. The internal heat left over from formation facilitated volcanic activity that outgassed Titan’s original complement of atmospheric methane molecules. Some of this methane was reabsorbed
into the interior; the rest was destroyed by ultraviolet light from
the Sun within the first billion years. From 3.5 billion to 2 billion
years ago, Titan’s atmosphere was essentially free of methane.
Over time, the rocky core increased in temperature due to the
decay of radioactive elements like uranium. (These elements are
concentrated in Titan’s core to a greater extent than on Earth,
which has rocky substances throughout its volume.) About 2 billion years ago, the core became warm enough to partially melt,
and convection began in the melted portion. This allowed heat to
flow from the core into the mantle, triggering a second episode of
methane outgassing. This, too, eventually came to an end, and
methane once again disappeared from Titan’s atmosphere.
The third and final release of methane began about 500 million years ago, as the last of Titan’s internal heat from radioactivity caused convection to take place in the satellite’s ice crust.
The amount of methane released during the current episode is
enough to sustain the gas in the atmosphere, but not enough to
provide extensive lakes of methane or ethane.
Within the next several hundred million years, methane outgassing on Titan will cease for good. In time, the hydrocarbon
haze will disappear, the skies will clear, and the surface of Titan
will be revealed to whatever outside observers may gaze upon it
in that distant era.

Hydrocarbon Seas on Titan? Cassini used its onboard
radar to record this view of a region near Titan’s north
pole. The dark regions show where the surface does not
reflect radio waves at all, which would be the case if these
regions were lakes filled with liquid methane or liquid
ethane. In support of this idea, many of the dark regions
appear to have liquid-carved inflow or outflow channels.

13-9 Jupiter has dozens of small satellites
that have different origins
LINK 13

WEB

.14

Besides the Galilean satellites, Jupiter has at least 59
other small satellites. Each is named for a mythological character associated with Jupiter. Appendix 3 gives
details of some of the satellites’ orbits. It is helpful to sort Jupiter’s
63 known satellites (as of 2006) into three groups according to
their sizes and orbits.
Four planet-sized satellites, Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto, can be thought of as four of the terrestrial worlds of the solar system. All are comparable in size to the planet Mercury (see
Table 13-1). The semimajor axes of their orbits range from 5.9
to 26 times the radius of Jupiter. (By comparison, the distance
from the Earth to the Moon is about 60 times the Earth’s radius.)
Four small inner satellites, Metis, Adrastea, Amalthea, and
Thebe, have orbital semimajor axes between 1.8 and 3.1 times the
radius of Jupiter. As Figure 13-21 shows, these satellites have irregular shapes, much like a potato (or an asteroid). The largest of
the inner satellites, Amalthea, measures about 270 by 150 km
(170 by 95 mi)—about 10 times larger than the moons of Mars,
but only about one-tenth the size of the Galilean satellites. Discovered in 1892, Amalthea has a distinct reddish color due to sulfur that Jupiter’s magnetosphere removed from Io’s volcanic
plumes, then deposited onto Amalthea’s surface. The three other
inner satellites are even smaller than Amalthea. They were first
discovered in images from Voyager 1 and Voyager 2.

Jupiter’s Four Inner Satellites First observed in 1892, Amalthea was
the last satellite of any planet to be discovered without the aid of
photography. Metis, Adrastea, and Thebe, by contrast, are so small that
they were not discovered until 1979. These images from the Galileo
spacecraft are the first to show these three satellites as anything more
than points of light. (NASA/JPL; Cornell University)

Fifty-five small outer satellites have diameters from 184 km
for the largest to about 1 km for the smallest. All orbit far beyond Callisto, with semimajor axes that range from about 100 to
360 times the radius of Jupiter. (Twenty-three of these satellites
were discovered in 2003 alone, and even more may be discovered
as telescope technology continues to evolve.)
The Galilean satellites and the four inner satellites all orbit
Jupiter in the plane of the planet’s equator. (The same is true of
Jupiter’s rings, discussed in Section 12-9.) Furthermore, these are
all prograde orbits, which means that these objects orbit Jupiter
in the same direction as Jupiter’s rotation. This is what we would ex- Only a few of Jupiter’s
pect if these satellites formed from
satellites orbit the planet
the same primordial, rotating cloud
as Jupiter itself. (In a similar way, in the same direction as
the planets all orbit the Sun in nearly Jupiter rotates
the same plane and in the same direction as the Sun’s rotation. As we saw in Section 8-3, this reinforces the idea that the Sun and planets formed from the same
solar nebula.)
In contrast, the 55 outer satellites all circle Jupiter along orbits that are inclined at steep angles to the planet’s equatorial
plane. These satellites are thought not to have formed along with
Jupiter; rather, they are probably wayward asteroids captured by
Jupiter’s powerful gravitational field. One piece of evidence for
this is that 48 of the outer satellites are in retrograde orbits: They
orbit Jupiter in a direction opposite the planet’s rotation. Calculations show that it is easier for Jupiter to capture a satellite into
a retrograde orbit than a prograde one.

13-10 The icy surfaces of Saturn’s six
moderate-sized moons provide clues
to their histories
Saturn, too, has an extensive collection of satellites: 56 were
known as of 2006. As we did for Jupiter’s satellites in Section
13-9, we can subdivide the satellites of Saturn into three categories based on their sizes and their orbits. (Appendix 3 has information about the orbits of all of Saturn’s satellites.) We will
see that while Saturn does not have a set of large moons like the
Galilean satellites of Jupiter, it does have a remarkably diverse
collection of moderate-sized satellites.

Saturn’s Retinue of Moons
One planet-sized satellite, Titan, is actually one of the terrestrial
worlds of our solar system. With its diameter of 5150 km, Titan
is intermediate in size between Mercury and Mars. Its prograde
orbit has a semimajor axis of just over 20 times the radius of
Saturn and lies in nearly the same plane as Saturn’s equator
and rings.
Six moderate-sized satellites were all discovered before 1800.
These six satellites have properties and diameters that lead us to
group them in pairs: Mimas and Enceladus (400 to 500 km in diameter), Tethys and Dione (roughly 1000 km in diameter), and
Rhea and Iapetus (about 1500 km in diameter). The semimajor
axes of their orbits range from 3.1 to 59 times the radius of

Jupiter and Saturn’s Satellites of Fire and Ice

Saturn. Like Titan, all of their orbits are prograde and close to
the plane of Saturn’s equator.
Forty-nine small satellites have sizes from 3 to 266 km. Some
are in prograde orbits as small as 2.2 times the radius of Saturn,
and lie within or close to the rings (see Figure 12-25). These may
be jagged fragments of ice and rock produced by impacts and collisions. The shepherd satellites that shape Saturn’s F ring (see Figure 12-24) may be such fragments. Others are in retrograde orbits
with semimajor axes as large as 380 times Saturn’s radius, and
may be captured asteroids.

Six Strange Satellites
The most curious and mysterious of these worlds may be Saturn’s
six moderate-sized satellites (Figure 13-22). These six satellites
have very low average densities of less than 1400 kg/m3. This implies that unlike the satellites of the inner solar system or the
Galilean satellites of Jupiter, they are composed primarily of ices
(mostly frozen water and ammonia) with very little rock. The motions of these mid-sized satellites are not surprising: All six orbit
the planet in the plane of Saturn’s equator and in the direction of

Large crater

the planet’s rotation, and all six exhibit synchronous rotation.
What is surprising is the curious variety of surface features that
the Voyager and Cassini spacecraft discovered on these satellites.
Mimas, the innermost of the six middle-sized moons, has the
heavily cratered surface we would expect on such a small world.
Its most remarkable feature is a crater so large (Figure 13-22a)
that the impact that formed it must have come close to shattering
Mimas into fragments.
In contrast to Mimas’s heavily cratered surface, its neighbor
and near twin, Enceladus, has extensive crater-free regions (Figure 13-22b). Some form of geologic
activity has resurfaced these areas Although just 500 km
within the past 100 million years,
across, Enceladus has
and may still be under way. Geologic activity may also explain why powerful volcanoes at its
Enceladus has an amazingly high south pole
albedo of 0.95, making it the most
reflective large object in our solar system. Some process has freed
Enceladus’s icy surface of rock and dust, whose presence on
the other icy satellites is the likeliest explanation for their lower
albedos. Most remarkably, Cassini discovered that Enceladus is

Figure 13-23a shows several distinct plumes ejecting icy particles
from near the satellite’s south pole, the same region where the
surface is laced with bluish stress cracks (see Figure 13-22b).
Some of the particles are ejected with such force that they escape
Enceladus altogether and go into orbit around Saturn, forming a
tenuous ring (Figure 13-23b).
What could be powering the geologic activity on Enceladus?
One guess is tidal heating, which provides the internal heat for
the inner Galilean satellites of Jupiter (see Section 13-4). The
satellite Dione orbits Saturn in 65.7 hours, almost exactly twice
Enceladus’s orbital period of 32.9 hours, and the 1:2 ratio of orbital periods should set Enceladus up to be caught in a tidal tugof-war between Saturn and Dione. Calculations suggest that the
amount of tidal heating produced in this way is modest, but
should be enough to melt the ices of Enceladus at least part of the
time. Curiously, there is also a 1:2 ratio between the orbital periods of Mimas and Saturn’s moon Tethys, but the cratered surface of Mimas shows no sign that this moon was ever tidally
heated.
Tethys and Dione are the next-largest pair of Saturn’s six
moderate-sized satellites. Most of Tethys, like Mimas, is heavily
cratered. But Tethys also has an immense rift valley called Ithaca
Chasma that extends for 2000 km, or about 3⁄4 of the way around
Tethys (Figure 13-22c). This rift may have formed when the water inside Tethys cooled and solidified, or it may be the result of
a shock wave that traveled through Tethys after an immense asteroid impact. (A large impact crater lies on the side of Tethys opposite Ithaca Chasma.) Dione, slightly larger than Tethys, has a
strange surface dichotomy: The surfaces of its leading hemisphere
(that is, the hemisphere facing toward its direction of orbital motion) and trailing hemisphere are quite different. Dione’s leading
hemisphere is heavily cratered, but its trailing hemisphere is cov-

tectonic activity (Figure 13-22d).
Because Tethys and Dione have about double the diameter of
Enceladus, the energy to power their geologic activity might have
come from within. These larger satellites retain heat more effectively, including heat from the decay of radioactive materials in
each satellite’s interior. Such materials are scarce within the icy
satellites of Saturn, but only relatively little heat is needed to
power ice volcanism.
Rhea and Iapetus are the largest and most distant of Saturn’s
moderate-sized moons. Rhea is heavily cratered, including a
bright, fresh-looking crater on its leading hemisphere (Figure
13-22e). This may be the result of a more recent impact than
those that formed most of Rhea’s craters.
Iapetus has been known to be unusual ever since its discovery in 1671: Unlike the other satellites, its brightness varies greatly
as it orbits Saturn. Images from Cassini show extreme differences
between the leading and trailing hemispheres of Iapetus (Figure
13-22f ). Most of the leading hemisphere is as black as asphalt
(albedo ⫽ 0.05), but the trailing hemisphere is highly reflective
(albedo ⫽ 0.50), like the surfaces of the other moderate-sized
moons.
What could account for the two-sided nature of Iapetus? One
possibility is that the dark material covering Iapetus’s leading
hemisphere may have come from Phoebe, a smaller satellite that
orbits about 31⁄2 times farther from Saturn than Iapetus. Phoebe
moves in a retrograde direction along an orbit tilted well away
from the plane of Saturn’s equator. This motion leads scientists
to suspect that Phoebe is a captured asteroid, and its dark surface
does indeed resemble the surfaces of a particular class of carbonrich asteroids. Bits and pieces of this dark charcoal-like material
drifting toward Saturn may have been swept up onto the leading
hemisphere of Iapetus. However, a sticking point with this sce-

Jupiter and Saturn’s Satellites of Fire and Ice

nario is that the dark material on Iapetus is reddish in color, while
Phoebe’s surface is not. An alternative explanation is that a large
portion of the leading hemisphere of Iapetus was coated with
methane ice, which darkened when exposed to solar radiation.

Nature of the Galilean Satellites: The four Galilean
satellites orbit Jupiter in the plane of its equator. All
are in synchronous rotation.

• The orbital periods of the three innermost Galilean satellites, Io,
Europa, and Ganymede, are in the ratio 1:2:4.
• The two innermost Galilean satellites, Io and Europa, have
roughly the same size and density as our Moon. They are composed principally of rocky material. The two outermost Galilean
satellites, Ganymede and Callisto, are roughly the size of Mercury. Lower in density than either the Moon or Mercury, they are
made of roughly equal parts ice and rock.
• The Galilean satellites probably formed in a similar fashion to
our solar system but on a smaller scale.
Io: Io is covered with a colorful layer of sulfur compounds deposited by frequent explosive eruptions from volcanic vents. These
eruptions resemble terrestrial geysers.
• The energy to heat Io’s interior and produce the satellite’s volcanic activity comes from tidal forces that flex the satellite. This
tidal flexing is aided by the 1:2:4 ratio of orbital periods among
the inner three Galilean satellites.
• The Io torus is a ring of electrically charged particles circling
Jupiter at the distance of Io’s orbit. Interactions between this ring
and Jupiter’s magnetic field produce strong radio emissions. Io
may also have a magnetic field of its own.

• Ganymede is highly differentiated, and probably has a metallic
core. It has a surprisingly strong magnetic field and a magnetosphere of its own.
• While there is at present little tidal heating of Ganymede, it may
have been heated in this fashion in the past. An induced magnetic
field suggests that it, too, has a layer of liquid water beneath the
surface.
Callisto: Callisto has a heavily cratered crust of water ice. The
surface shows little sign of geologic activity, because there was
never any significant tidal heating of Callisto. However, some unknown processes have erased the smallest craters and blanketed
the surface with a dark, dusty substance.
• Magnetic field data seem to suggest that Callisto has a shallow
subsurface ocean.
Titan: The largest Saturnian satellite, Titan, is a terrestrial world
with a dense nitrogen atmosphere. A variety of hydrocarbons are
produced there by the interaction of sunlight with methane. These
compounds form an aerosol layer in Titan’s atmosphere and fall
as a gentle rain on the surface.
• Titan’s surface shows that liquid hydrocarbons have flowed
over its surface, forming streams, rivers, and outflow channels.
Very little of this liquid appears to be present on Titan’s surface
today.
Other Satellites: As of 2006, Jupiter has a total of 63 known satellites and Saturn has a total of 56.
• In addition to the Galilean satellites, Jupiter has four small inner satellites that lie inside Io’s orbit. Like the Galilean satellites,
these orbit in the plane of Jupiter’s equator. The remaining satellites are small and move in much larger orbits that are noticeably
inclined to the plane of Jupiter’s equator. Many of these orbit in
the direction opposite to Jupiter’s rotation.
• In addition to Titan, six moderate-sized moons circle Saturn in
regular orbits: Mimas, Enceladus, Tethys, Dione, Rhea, and Iapetus. They are probably composed largely of ice, but their surface
features and histories vary significantly. The other, smaller moons
include shepherd satellites that control the shapes of Saturn’s
rings and captured asteroids in large retrograde orbits.

Questions
Review Questions

Europa: While composed primarily of rock, Europa is covered
with a smooth layer of water ice.

1.

• The surface has hardly any craters, indicating a geologically active history. Other indications are a worldwide network of long
cracks and ice rafts that indicate a subsurface layer of liquid water or soft ice. As for Io, tidal heating is responsible for Europa’s
internal heat.

2.
3.

• An ocean may lie beneath Europa’s frozen surface. Minerals dissolved in this ocean may explain Europa’s induced magnetic field.
Ganymede: Two types of terrain are found on the icy surface of
Ganymede: areas of dark, ancient, heavily cratered surface and regions of heavily grooved, lighter-colored, younger terrain.

Chapter 13

In the classic science-fiction film 2010: The Year We Make
Contact, an alien intelligence causes Jupiter to contract so
much that nuclear reactions begin at its center. As a result,
Jupiter becomes a star like the Sun. Is this possible in principle? Explain your answer.
All of the Galilean satellites orbit Jupiter in the same direction. Furthermore, the planes of their orbits all lie within 0.5°
of Jupiter’s equatorial plane. Explain why these observations
are consistent with the idea that the Galilean satellites formed
from a “Jovian nebula.”
What is the source of energy that powers Io’s volcanoes?
How is it related to the orbits of Io and the other Galilean
satellites?
Io has no impact craters on its surface, while our Moon is
covered with craters. What is the explanation for this difference?
Despite all the gases released from its interior by volcanic activity, Io does not possess a thick atmosphere. Explain why
not.
Long before the Voyager flybys, Earth-based astronomers reported that Io appeared brighter than usual for the few hours
after it emerged from Jupiter’s shadow. From what we know
about the material ejected from Io’s volcanoes, suggest an explanation for this brief brightening of Io.

What is the evidence for an ocean of liquid water beneath Europa’s icy surface? What is the evidence that substances other
than water are dissolved in this ocean?
What aspects of Europa lead scientists to speculate that life
may exist there? What precautions have been taken to prevent contaminating Europa with Earth organisms?
Why is ice an important constituent of Ganymede and Callisto, but not of the Earth’s Moon?
How do scientists know that the dark terrain on Ganymede
is younger than the bright terrain?
In what ways is Ganymede like our own Moon? In what
ways is it different? What are the reasons for the differences?
Why were scientists surprised to learn that Ganymede has a
magnetic field? What does this field tell us about Ganymede’s
history?
What leads scientists to suspect that there is liquid water beneath Ganymede’s surface?
Why are numerous impact craters found on Ganymede and

these come as a surprise?
Compare and contrast the surface features of the four Galilean

evolution of these four satellites.
The larger the orbit of a Galilean satellite, the less geologic

32. In what ways do hydrocarbons on Titan behave like water
on Earth?
33. Why does the presence of methane in Titan’s atmosphere imply that Titan has had recent volcanic activity?
34. What is the evidence that there were liquid hydrocarbons on
Titan in the past? That there are liquid hydrocarbons now?
35. How would you account for the existence of the satellites of
Jupiter other than the Galilean ones?
36. Which of Saturn’s moderate-sized satellites show evidence of
geologic activity? What might be the energy source for this
activity?
37. Explain why debris from Phoebe would be expected to pile
up only on the leading hemisphere of Iapetus. (Hint: How do
the orbits of these two satellites compare? How does the orbital motion of debris falling slowly inward toward Saturn
compare with the orbital motion of Iapetus?)
38. Saturn’s equator is tilted by 27° from the ecliptic, while
Jupiter’s equator is tilted by only 3°. Use these data to explain why we see fewer transits, eclipses, and occultations of
Saturn’s satellites than of the Galilean satellites.

Problem-solving tips and tools
Newton’s form of Kepler’s third law (Box 4-4) relates the
masses of two objects in orbit around each other to the period and size of the orbit. The small-angle formula is discussed in Box 1-1. The best seeing conditions on the Earth
give a limiting angular resolution of 1⁄4 arcsec. Because the orbits of the Galilean satellites are almost perfect circles, you
can easily calculate the orbital speeds of these satellites from
the data listed in Table 13-1. Data about Jupiter itself are
given in Table 12-1 and data about all of the satellites of
Jupiter and Saturn can be found in Appendix 3. For a discussion of escape speed and how planets retain their atmospheres, see Box 7-2.

39. Using the orbital data in Table 13-1, demonstrate that the
Galilean satellites obey Kepler’s third law.

see on a Galilean satellite through a large telescope under
conditions of excellent seeing when Jupiter is near opposition? How does this compare with the best Galileo images,
which have resolutions around 25 meters?

42. Explain why the volcanic plumes in Figure 13-5b have a
bluish color. (Hint: See Box 5-4.)
43. Jupiter, its magnetic field, and the charged particles that are
trapped in the magnetosphere all rotate together once every
10 hours. Io takes 1.77 days to complete one orbit. Using a
diagram, explain why particles from Jupiter’s magnetosphere
hit Io primarily from behind (that is, on the side of Io that
trails as it orbits the planet).
44. Assuming material is ejected from Io into Jupiter’s magnetosphere at the rate of 1 ton per second (1000 kg/s), how long
will it be before Io loses 10% of its mass? How does your
answer compare with the age of the solar system?
45. Volcanic eruptions from Io add about 1 ton of material to
Jupiter’s magnetosphere every second. Based on the information given in Section 13-4, what fraction of the material
ejected from Io’s volcanoes goes into Jupiter’s magnetosphere?
46. How long does it take for Ganymede to entirely enter or entirely leave Jupiter’s shadow? Assume that the shadow has a
sharp edge.
47. Figure 13-15 shows that Ganymede’s dark terrain has both
more craters and larger craters than the bright terrain. Explain what this tells you about the sizes of meteoroids present in the solar system in the distant past and in the more
recent past.
48. Put a few cubes of ice in a glass, then fill the glass with warm
water to make the ice cubes crack. The fracture lines in each
cube are clearly visible because they reflect light. Use this observation to suggest why Ganymede’s icy bright terrain, which
may have been badly fractured by the stresses that produced
the grooves (Figure 13-15), is 25% more reflective than the
dark terrain.

(Hint: Use the ideas presented in Box 7-2 and assume an average atmospheric temperature of 95 K.)
50. Many of the gases in the atmosphere of Titan, such as methane,
ethane, and acetylene, are highly flammable. Why, then,
doesn’t Titan’s atmosphere catch fire? (Hint: What gas in our
atmosphere is needed to make wood, coal, or gasoline burn?)
51. Suppose the Earth’s Moon were removed and replaced in its
orbit by Titan. What changes would you expect to occur in
Titan’s atmosphere? Would solar eclipses be more or less
common as seen from Earth? Explain your answers.
52. At infrared wavelengths, the Hubble Space Telescope can see
details on Titan’s surface as small as 580 km (360 mi) across.
Determine the angular resolution of the Hubble Space Telescope using infrared light. If visible light is used, is the angular

Observing tips and tools

You can easily find the apparent positions of the
Galilean satellites for any date and time using the
Starry Night Enthusiast™ software on the CD-ROM that accompanies certain printed copies of this textbook. For even
more detailed information about satellite positions, consult
the “Satellites of Jupiter” section in the Astronomical Almanac for the current year. If your goal is to view Saturn’s
satellites, consult the section entitled “Satellites of Saturn” in
the Astronomical Almanac for the current year. This includes
a diagram showing the orbits of Mimas, Enceladus, Tethys,
Dione, Rhea, Titan, and Hyperion. Plan your observing session by looking up the dates and times of the most recent
greatest eastern elongations of the various satellites. You will
have to convert from universal time (UT), also known as
Greenwich Mean Time, to your local time zone. Then, using
the tick marks along the orbits in the diagram, estimate the
positions of the satellites relative to Saturn at the time you
will be at the telescope. Another useful resource is the “Celestial Calendar” section of Sky & Telescope. During months
when Saturn is visible in the night sky, this section of the
magazine includes a chart of Saturn’s satellites.

eyond Saturn, in the cold, dark recesses of the solar system,
orbit three planets that have long been shrouded in mystery.
These planets—Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto (all shown here
to the same scale as the Earth)—are so distant, so dimly lit by the
Sun, and so slow in their motion against the stars that they were
unknown to ancient astronomers and were discovered only after
the invention of the telescope. Even then, little was known about
Uranus and Neptune until Voyager 2 flew past these planets during the 1980s.
Surrounded by a system of small moons and thin, dark rings,
Uranus is tipped on its side so that its axis of rotation lies nearly
in its orbital plane. This remarkable orientation suggests that
Uranus may have been the victim of a staggering impact by a mas-

sive planetesimal. Neptune is, at first glance, a denser, more massive version of Uranus, but it is a far more active world. It has an
internal energy source that Uranus seemingly lacks, as well as
atmospheric bands and storm activity resembling those on Jupiter.
Neptune also has dark rings, small, icy moons, and an intriguing large satellite, Triton, which is nearly devoid of impact
craters and has geysers that squirt nitrogen-rich vapors. Triton’s
retrograde orbit suggests that this strange world may have been
gravitationally captured by Neptune.
Close cousins of Triton are Pluto and thousands of other
trans-Neptunian objects, among the most remote members of the
solar system. These objects harbor many mysteries, in part because they have not yet been visited by a spacecraft.

14-1 Uranus was discovered by chance,
but Neptune’s existence was predicted
by applying Newtonian mechanics
Before the eighteenth century, only six planets were known to orbit the Sun: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn.
That state of affairs changed thanks to William Herschel, a
German-born musician who moved to England in 1757 and became fascinated by astronomy.

Discovering the “Georgian Star”
Using a telescope that he built himself, Herschel was systematically surveying the sky on March 13, 1781, when he noticed a
faint, fuzzy object that he first thought to be a distant comet. By
the end of 1781, however, his observations had revealed that the

object’s orbit was relatively circular and was larger than Saturn’s
orbit. Comets, by contrast, can normally be seen only when they
follow elliptical orbits that bring them much closer to the Sun.
Herschel had discovered the seventh planet from the Sun. In
doing so, he had doubled the radius of the known solar system

(the distance from the Sun to Uranus). Herschel originally named
his discovery Georgium Sidus (Latin for “Georgian star”) in honor
of the reigning monarch, George III. The name Uranus—in Greek
mythology, the personification of Heaven—came into currency
only some decades later.
Although Herschel received the credit for discovering Uranus,
he was by no means the first person to have seen it. At opposition, Uranus is just barely bright enough to be seen with the
naked eye under good observing conditions, so it was probably
seen by the ancients. Many other astronomers with telescopes had

sighted this planet before Herschel; it is plotted on at least 20 star
charts drawn between 1690 and 1781. But all these other observers mistook Uranus for a dim star. Herschel was the first to
track its motion relative to the stars and recognize it as a planet.
This was no small task, because Uranus moves very slowly on the
celestial sphere, just over 4° in the space of a year (compared to
about 12° for Saturn and about 35° for Jupiter).

The Discovery of Neptune
It was by carefully tracking Uranus’s slow motions that astronomers were led to discover Neptune. By the beginning of the
nineteenth century, it had become painfully clear to astronomers
that they could not accurately predict the orbit of Uranus using
Newtonian mechanics. By 1830 the discrepancy between the
planet’s predicted and observed positions had become large

enough (2 arcmin) that some scientists suspected that Newton’s
law of gravitation might not be accurate at great distances from
the Sun.
By the mid-1840s, two scientists working independently—the
French astronomer Urbain Jean Joseph Le Verrier and the English
mathematician John Couch Adams—were exploring an earlier
and sounder suggestion. Perhaps the gravitational pull of an as
yet undiscovered planet was causing Uranus to deviate slightly
from its predicted orbit. Calculations by both scientists concluded
that Uranus had indeed caught up with and had passed a more
distant planet. Uranus had accelerated slightly as it approached
the unknown planet, then decelerated slightly as it receded from
the planet.
Inspired by Le Verrier’s results, astronomers at Cambridge
University Observatory undertook a six-week search for the proposed new planet in the summer of 1846. They were unsuccessful,

Chapter 14

Observing Uranus and Neptune
Through a large, modern telescope, both Uranus and Neptune are
dim, uninspiring sights. Each planet appears as a hazy, featureless
disk with a faint greenish-blue tinge.
Although Uranus and Neptune are Uranus and Neptune are
both about 4 times larger in diamein such large orbits that
ter than Earth, they are so distant
that their angular diameters as seen they move very slowly on
from the Earth are tiny—no more the celestial sphere
than 4 arcsec for Uranus and just
over 2 arcsec for Neptune. To an Earth-based observer, Uranus
is roughly the size of a golf ball seen at a distance of 1 kilometer.
From 2007 through 2011, Uranus and Neptune are less than
40° apart in the sky in the adjacent constellations of Pisces, Aquarius, and Capricornus (the Sea Goat). During these years, the two
planets are at opposition in either August or September, which
are thus the best months to view them with a telescope. Table
14-1 and Table 14-2 give basic data about Uranus and Neptune,
respectively.

14-2 Uranus is nearly featureless and has an
unusually tilted axis of rotation
Scientists had hoped that Voyager 2 would reveal cloud patterns
in Uranus’s atmosphere when it flew past the planet in January
1986. But even images recorded at close range showed Uranus to
be remarkably featureless (Figure 14-1). Faint cloud markings became visible in images of Uranus only after extreme computer enhancement (Figure 14-2).

in part because they lacked accurate star maps of the part of the
sky being searched. The Cambridge astronomers also did not receive supporting information from Adams in a timely manner.
Meanwhile, Le Verrier wrote to Johann Gottfried Galle at the
Berlin Observatory with detailed predictions of where to search
for the new planet. Galle received the letter on September 23,
1846. That very night, aided by more complete star maps and after just a half-hour of searching, Galle and Heinrich d’Arrest located an uncharted star with the expected brightness in the
predicted location. Subsequent observations confirmed that this
new “star” showed a planetlike motion with respect to other
stars.
Le Verrier proposed that the planet be called Neptune. After
years of debate between English and French astronomers, the
credit for its discovery came to be divided between Adams and Le
Verrier. Neptune is thus the only planet whose existence was revealed by calculation rather than chance discovery.
At opposition, Neptune can be bright enough to be visible
through small telescopes. The first person thus to have seen it was
probably Galileo. His drawings from January 1613, when he was
using his telescope to observe Jupiter and its four large satellites,
show a “star” less than 1 arcmin from Neptune’s location. Galileo
even noted in his observation log that on one night this star
seemed to have moved in relation to the other stars. But Galileo
would have been hard pressed to identify Neptune as a planet, because its motion against the background stars is so slow (just over
2° per year).

Uranus from Voyager 2 This image looks nearly straight
down onto Uranus’s south pole, which was pointed almost
directly at the Sun when Voyager 2 flew past in 1986. None of the
Voyager 2 images of Uranus show any pronounced cloud patterns. The
color is due to methane in the planet’s atmosphere, which absorbs red
light but reflects green and blue. (JPL/NASA)

Uranus’s Atmosphere
Voyager 2 data confirmed that the Uranian atmosphere is dominated by hydrogen (82.5%) and helium (15.2%), similar to the
atmospheres of Jupiter and Saturn. Uranus differs, however, in
that 2.3% of its atmosphere is methane (CH4), which is 5 to 10
times the percentage found on Jupiter and Saturn. In fact, Uranus
has a higher percentage of all heavy elements—including carbon
atoms, which are found in molecules of methane—than Jupiter
and Saturn. (In Section 14-4 we will investigate how this could
have come about.)
Methane preferentially absorbs the longer wavelengths of visible light, so sunlight reflected from Uranus’s upper atmosphere
is depleted of its reds and yellows. This gives the planet its distinct greenish-blue appearance. As on Saturn’s moon Titan (see
Section 13-8), ultraviolet light from the Sun turns some of the
methane gas into a hydrocarbon haze, making it difficult to see
the lower levels of the atmosphere.
Ammonia (NH3), which constitutes 0.01 to 0.03% of the
atmospheres of Jupiter and Saturn, is almost completely absent
from the Uranian atmosphere. The reason is that Uranus is colder
than Jupiter or Saturn: The temperature in its upper atmosphere
is only 55 K (⫺218°C ⫽ ⫺360°F). Ammonia freezes at these very
low temperatures, so any ammonia has long since precipitated out
of the atmosphere and into the planet’s interior. For the same reason, Uranus’s atmosphere is also lacking in water. Hence, the substances that make up the clouds on Jupiter and Saturn—ammonia,
ammonium hydrosulfide (NH4SH), and water—are not available
on Uranus. This helps to explain the bland, uniform appearance
of the planet shown in Figure 14-1.
The few clouds found on Uranus are made primarily of
methane, which condenses into droplets only if the pressure is suf-

ficiently high. Hence, methane clouds form only at lower levels
within the atmosphere, where they are difficult to see.

Cloud bands

An Oddly Tilted Planet
The rotation period of Uranus’s atmosphere is about 16 hours.
Like Jupiter and Saturn, Uranus rotates differentially, so this period depends on the latitude. This can be measured by tracking
the motions of clouds. To determine the rotation period for the
underlying body of the planet, scientists looked to Uranus’s magnetic field, which is presumably anchored in the planet’s interior,
or at least in the deeper and denser layers of its atmosphere. Data
from Voyager 2 indicate that Uranus’s internal period of rotation
is 17.24 hours.
Voyager 2 also confirmed that Uranus’s rotation axis is tilted
in a unique and bizarre way. Herschel found the first evidence of
this in 1787, when he discovered two moons orbiting Uranus in
a plane that is almost perpendicular to the plane of the planet’s
orbit around the Sun. Because the large moons of Jupiter and Saturn were known to orbit in the same plane as their planet’s equator and in the same direction as their planet’s rotation, it was
thought that the same must be true for the moons of Uranus.
Thus, Uranus’s equator must be almost perpendicular to the plane
of its orbit, and its rotation axis must lie very nearly in that plane
(Figure 14-3).
Careful measurement shows that Uranus’s axis of rotation is
tilted by 98°, as compared to 231⁄2° for Earth (compare Figure
14-3 with Figure 2-12). A tilt angle greater than 90° means that

Exaggerated Seasons on Uranus For most planets, the

rotation axis is roughly perpendicular to the plane of the
planet’s orbit around the Sun. But for Uranus the rotation axis is tilted by
98° from the perpendicular. This causes severely exaggerated seasons.

For example, during midsummer at Uranus’s south pole, the Sun appears
nearly overhead for many Earth years, while the planet’s northern regions
are in continuous darkness. Half an orbit later, the seasons are reversed.

Chapter 14

By following the motions of clouds and storm systems on Uranus,
scientists find that the planet’s winds flow to the east—that is, in
the same direction as the planet’s rotation—at northern and southern latitudes, but to the west near the equator. This is quite unlike the situation on Jupiter and Saturn, where the zonal winds
alternate direction many times between the north and south poles
(see Section 12-4). The fastest Uranian winds (about 700 km/h,
or 440 mi/h) are found at the equator.
We saw in Section 12-4 that the internal heat of Jupiter and
Saturn plays a major role in driving atmospheric activity on those
worlds. Uranus is different: It appears to have little or no internal Unlike the other Jovian
source of thermal energy. Measureplanets, Uranus’s interior
ments to date show that unlike
Jupiter or Saturn, Uranus radiates heat has no effect on its
into space only as much energy as it atmosphere’s motions
receives from the Sun. With only feeble sunlight to provide energy to its atmosphere, Uranus lacks the
dramatic wind and cloud patterns found on Jupiter and Saturn.
It is not known why Uranus should be different from Jupiter and
Saturn.
Although Uranus’s equatorial region was receiving little sunlight at the time of the Voyager 2 flyby, the atmospheric temperature there (about 55 K ⫽ ⫺218°C ⫽ ⫺359°F) was not too
different from that at the sunlit pole. Heat must therefore be efficiently transported from the poles to the equator. This northsouth heat transport, which is perpendicular to the wind flow,
may have mixed and homogenized the atmosphere to make Uranus
nearly featureless.

At first glance, Neptune appears to be the twin of Uranus.
(See the image that opens this chapter, and compare Tables 14-1 and 14-2.) But these two planets are by no
means identical. While Neptune and Uranus have almost the same

The Voyager 2 data showed that Neptune has essentially the same
atmospheric composition as Uranus: 79% hydrogen, 18% helium, 3% methane, and almost no ammonia or water vapor. As
for Uranus, the presence of methane gives Neptune a characteristic bluish-green color. The temperature in the upper atmosphere
is also the same as on Uranus, about 55 K. That this should be
so, even though Neptune is much farther from the Sun, is further
evidence that Neptune has a strong internal heat source.
Unlike Uranus, however, Neptune has clearly visible cloud
patterns in its atmosphere. At the time that Voyager 2 flew past
Neptune, the most prominent feature in the planet’s atmosphere
was a giant storm called the Great
Dark Spot (Figure 14-4). The Great Unlike its close relative

diameter, Neptune is 18% more massive. Neptune’s axis of rotation also has a more modest 291⁄2° tilt. When Voyager 2 flew past
Neptune in August 1989, it revealed that the planet has a more
active and dynamic atmosphere than Uranus. This activity suggests that Neptune, unlike Uranus, has a powerful source of energy in its interior.

WE

Uranus exhibits retrograde (backward) rotation like that of Venus,
shown in Figure 11-7b. Astronomers suspect that Uranus might
have acquired its large tilt angle billions of years ago, when another massive body collided with Uranus while the planet was still
forming.
The radical tilt of its axis means that as Uranus moves along
its 84-year orbit, its north and south poles alternately point toward or away from the Sun. This produces highly exaggerated
seasonal changes. For example, when Voyager 2 flew by in 1986,
Uranus’s south pole was pointed toward the Sun. Most of the
planet’s southern hemisphere was bathed in continuous sunlight,
while most of the northern hemisphere was subjected to a continuous, frigid winter night. But over the following quarter of a
Uranian year later (21 of our years), sunlight has gradually been
returning to the northern hemisphere, triggering immense storms
there. Figure 14-2 shows some of these storms, which are much
more visible at infrared wavelengths than with visible light.

idence for this is that Neptune, like Jupiter and Saturn but unlike
Uranus, emits more energy than it receives from the Sun. The
combination of a warm interior and a cold outer atmosphere can
cause convection in Neptune’s atmosphere, producing the upand-down motion of gases that generates clouds and storms. Neptune also resembles Jupiter in having faint belts and zones parallel
to the planet’s equator (see Figure 14-6).
Like those on Uranus, most of Neptune’s clouds are probably made of droplets of liquid methane. Because these droplets
form fairly deep within the atmosphere, the clouds are more difficult to see than the ones on Jupiter. Hence, Neptune’s belts and
zones are less pronounced than Jupiter’s, although more so than
those on Uranus (thanks to the extra cloud-building energy from
Neptune’s interior). As described above, Neptune’s high-altitude
clouds (see Figure 14-5) are probably made of frozen methane.
Although Neptune displays more evidence of up-and-down
motion in its atmosphere than Uranus, the global pattern of east
and west winds is almost identical on the two planets. This is
rather strange. The two planets are heated very differently by the
Sun, thanks to their different distances from the Sun and the different tilts of their axes of rotation, so we might have expected
the wind patterns on Uranus and Neptune also to be different.
Perhaps the explanation of these wind patterns will involve understanding how heat is transported not only within the atmospheres of Uranus and Neptune but within their interiors as well.

Cirrus Clouds over Neptune Voyager 2 recorded this image of clouds
near Neptune’s terminator (the border between day and night on the
planet). Like wispy, high-altitude cirrus clouds in the Earth’s atmosphere,
these clouds are thought to be made of ice crystals. The difference is
that Neptune’s cirrus clouds are probably methane ice, not water ice as
on Earth. (NASA/JPL)

Thanks to its greater distance from the Sun, Neptune receives less
than half as much energy from the Sun as Uranus. But with less
solar energy available to power atmospheric motions, why are
there high-altitude clouds and huge, dark storms on Neptune but
not on Uranus? At least part of the answer is probably that Neptune is still slowly contracting, thus converting gravitational energy into thermal energy that heats the planet’s core. (The same
is true for Jupiter and Saturn, as we saw in Section 12-4.) The ev-

on both planets were comparable in size to the Earth’s diameter,
both appeared at about the same latitude in the southern hemisphere, and the winds in both storms circulated in a counterclockwise direction (see Figure 12-5). But Neptune’s Great Dark Spot
appears not to have been as long-lived as the Great Red Spot on
Jupiter. When the Hubble Space Telescope first viewed Neptune
in 1994, the Great Dark Spot had disappeared. Another dark
storm appeared in 1995 in Neptune’s northern hemisphere.
Voyager 2 also saw a few conspicuous whitish clouds on
Neptune. These clouds are thought to be produced when winds
carry methane gas into the cool, upper atmosphere, where it condenses into crystals of methane ice. Voyager 2 images show these
high-altitude clouds casting shadows onto lower levels of
Neptune’s atmosphere (Figure 14-5). Images from the Hubble
Space Telescope also show the presence of high-altitude clouds
(Figure 14-6).

Chapter 14

14-4 Uranus and Neptune contain a higher
proportion of heavy elements than Jupiter
and Saturn
At first glance, Uranus and Neptune might seem to be simply
smaller and less massive versions of Jupiter or Saturn (see Table
7-1). But like many first impressions, this one is misleading because it fails to take into account what lies beneath the surface.
We saw in Section 14-2 that the interiors of both Jupiter and Saturn are composed primarily of hydrogen and helium, in nearly the
same abundance as the Sun. But Uranus and Neptune must have a
different composition, because their average densities are too high.

Uranus and Neptune: Curiously Dense
If Uranus and Neptune had solar abundances of the elements, the
smaller masses of these planets would produce less gravitational
compression, and Uranus and Neptune would both have lower
average densities than Jupiter or Saturn. In fact, however, Uranus
and Neptune have average densities (1320 kg/m3 and 1640 kg/m3,
respectively) that are comparable to or greater than those of
Jupiter (1330 kg/m3) or Saturn (690 kg/m3). Therefore, we can
conclude that Uranus and Neptune contain greater proportions of
the heavier elements than do Jupiter or Saturn.
This picture is not what we might expect. According to our
discussion in Section 8-4 of how the solar system formed, hydrogen and helium should be relatively more abundant as distance
from the vaporizing heat of the Sun increases. But Uranus and
Neptune contain a greater percentage of heavy elements, and,
therefore, a smaller percentage of hydrogen and helium, than
Jupiter and Saturn.

A related problem is explaining the masses of Uranus and
Neptune. At the locations of Uranus (19 AU from the Sun) and
Neptune (30 AU from the Sun) the solar nebula was probably so
sparse that these planets would have taken tens of hundreds of
millions of years to grow to their present sizes around a core of
icy planetesimals. But protoplanetary disks observed around other
stars (see Section 8-3) do not appear to survive for that long before they dissipate. In other words, the problem is not how to explain why Uranus and Neptune are smaller than Jupiter and Saturn;
it is how to explain why Uranus and Neptune should exist at all!

Models of How Uranus and Neptune Formed
In one model for the origin of Uranus and Neptune, the planets
formed in denser regions of the solar nebula between 4 and 10
AU from the Sun. In this region they could have grown rapidly to
their present sizes. Had the planets remained at these locations,
they could eventually have accumulated enough hydrogen and helium to become as large as Jupiter or Saturn. But before that
could happen, gravitational interactions with Jupiter and Saturn would Explaining the origins

outward into their present large orposes a challenge to
bits. Because the solar nebula was
very sparse at those greater dis- planetary scientists
tances, Uranus and Neptune stopped
growing and remained at the sizes we see today.
An alternative idea is that Uranus and Neptune formed in
their present locations, not around a core of planetesimals but directly from the gases of the solar nebula. (We introduced this idea
in Section 8-4.) Once a ball of gas formed, icy particles within the
ball would have settled to its center, forming a solid core. This

Uranus, Neptune, Pluto, and the Kuiper Belt: Remote Worlds

of both Uranus and Neptune are tilted at steep angles to their
axes of rotation. Uranus’s magnetic axis, the line connecting its
north and south magnetic poles, is inclined by 59° from its axis
of rotation; Neptune’s magnetic axis is tilted by 47°. By contrast,
the magnetic axes of Earth, Jupiter, and Saturn are all nearly
aligned with their rotation axes; the angle between their magnetic
and rotation axes is 12° or less (Figure 14-8). Scientists were also
surprised to find that the magnetic fields of Uranus and Neptune
are offset from the centers of the planets.

process could have formed Uranus and Neptune in only a few
hundred years. In this model, Uranus and Neptune would actually have ended up larger than they are today, with substantially
more hydrogen and helium. But if there happened to be a hot star
relatively near the solar nebula, it would have emitted substantial
amounts of ultraviolet radiation (see Section 5-3 and Figure 5-11).
Ultraviolet photons have high energy (see Section 5-5), and a
shower of them could have stripped Uranus and Neptune of many
of their lightweight hydrogen and helium atoms, leaving shrunken
planets with a larger percentage of heavy elements. (In this picture, Jupiter and Saturn were protected from the star’s ultraviolet radiation because they were shrouded by the thicker clouds of
material in their part of the solar nebula.) More research will be
needed to better determine the origins of Uranus and Neptune.
Figure 14-7 shows one model for the present-day internal
structures of Uranus and Neptune. (Compare this to the internal
structures of Jupiter and Saturn, shown in Figure 12-12.) In this
model each planet has a rocky core roughly the size of Earth, although more massive. Each planet’s core is surrounded by a mantle of liquid water and ammonia. (This means that the mantle is
chemically similar to household window cleaning fluid.) Around
the mantle is a layer of liquid molecular hydrogen and liquid helium, with a small percentage of liquid methane. This layer is relatively shallow compared to those on Jupiter and Saturn, and the
pressure is not high enough to convert the liquid hydrogen into
liquid metallic hydrogen.

CAUTION! The drawing of the Earth’s magnetic field at the far
left of Figure 14-8 may seem to be mislabeled, because it shows
the south pole of a magnet at the Earth’s north pole. But, in fact,
this is correct, as you can understand by thinking about how
magnets work. On a magnet that is free to swivel, like the magnetized needle in a compass, the “north pole” is called that because it tends to point north on Earth. Likewise, a compass
needle’s south pole points toward the south on Earth. Furthermore, opposite magnetic poles attract. If you take two magnets
and put them next to each other, they try to align themselves so
that one magnet’s north pole is next to the other magnet’s south
pole. Now, if you think of a compass needle as one magnet and
the entire Earth as the other magnet, it makes sense that the
compass needle’s north pole is being drawn toward a magnetic
south pole—which happens to be located near the Earth’s geographic north pole. The Earth’s magnetic pole nearest its geographic North Pole is called the “magnetic north pole.” Note
that the magnets drawn inside Jupiter, Saturn, and Neptune are
oriented opposite to the Earth’s. On any of these planets, the
north pole of a compass needle would point south, not north!

Neptune are oriented at unusual angles

Chapter 14

magnetic fields might be undergoing a reversal; geological data
show that the Earth’s magnetic field has switched north to south
and back again many times in the past. Another possibility is that
the misalignments resulted from catastrophic collisions with
planet-sized bodies. As we discussed in Section 14-2, the tilt of
Uranus’s rotation axis and its system of moons suggest that such
collisions occurred long ago. As we will see in Section 14-7, Neptune may have gravitationally captured its largest moon, Triton,
but no one knows if that incident was responsible for offsetting
Neptune’s magnetic axis.
Because neither Uranus nor Neptune is massive enough to
compress hydrogen to a metallic state, their magnetic fields cannot be generated in the same way as
those of Jupiter and Saturn. Instead, Unlike any other planets,
under the high pressures found in Uranus and Neptune have
the watery mantles of Uranus and magnetic fields caused
Neptune, dissolved molecules such by ionized ammonia
as ammonia lose one or more electrons and become electrically charged (that is, they become ionized; see Section 5-8). Water is a good conductor of electricity
when it has such electrically charged molecules dissolved in it,
and electric currents in this fluid are probably the source of the
magnetic fields of Uranus and Neptune.

Path of starlight to Earth
when occultation begins

The Cosmic Connections figure summarizes the key properties of Uranus and Neptune and how they compare with those of
Jupiter and Saturn.

14-6 Uranus and Neptune each has a system
of thin, dark rings
On March 10, 1977, Uranus was scheduled to move in front of
a faint star, as seen from the Indian Ocean. A team of astronomers
headed by James L. Elliot of Cornell University observed this
event, called an occultation, from a NASA airplane equipped with
a telescope. They hoped that by measuring how long the star was
hidden, they could accurately measure Uranus’s size. In addition,
by carefully measuring how the starlight faded when Uranus
passed in front of the star, they planned to deduce important
properties of Uranus’s upper atmosphere.

Earth, Uranus occasionally appears to move in front of a
distant star. Such an event is called an occultation. The star’s light is

completely blocked when it is behind the planet. But before and after the
occultation by Uranus, the starlight dims temporarily as the rings pass in

Uranus’s Rings from the Hubble Space Telescope Several Hubble
Space Telescope images were assembled into this view of Uranus’s rings.
Relatively short exposure times reveal the planet and the inner rings,
while much longer exposure times were needed to reveal the outer rings.

concluded that Uranus must be surLike the planet itself, the

rings. In addition to these nine rings, rings of Uranus were
Voyager 2 discovered two others discovered by accident
that lie even closer to the cloudtops
of Uranus. Two other extremely faint rings, much larger in diameter than any of the others, were found in 2005 using the Hubble Space Telescope (Figure 14-10).
Unlike Saturn’s rings, the rings of Uranus are dark and narrow: Most are less than 10 km wide. Typical particles in Saturn’s
rings are chunks of reflective ice the size of snowballs (a few centimeters across), but typical particles in Uranus’s rings are 0.1 to
10 meters in size and are no more reflective than lumps of coal.
It is not surprising that these narrow, dark rings escaped detection for so long. Figure 14-11 is a Voyager 2 image of the rings
from the side of the planet away from the Sun, where light scattering from exceptionally small ring particles makes them more
visible. (We discussed light scattering in Section 5-6 and Box
5-4.) Figure 14-10 shows the Sun-facing side of the rings.
The Uranian rings are so dark because sunlight at Uranus is
only one-quarter as intense as at Saturn. As a result, Uranus’s ring
particles are so cold that they can retain methane ice. Scientists
speculate that eons of impacts by electrons trapped in the magnetospheres of the planets have converted this methane ice into dark
carbon compounds. This radiation darkening can account for the
low reflectivity of the rings.
Uranus’s major rings are located less than 2 Uranian radii
from the planet’s center, well within the planet’s Roche limit (see
Section 12-9). Some sort of mechanism, possibly one involving
shepherd satellites, efficiently confines particles to their narrow
orbits. (In Section 12-11 we discussed how shepherd satellites
help keep planetary rings narrow.) Voyager 2 searched for shepherd satellites but found only two. The others may be so small
and dark that they have simply escaped detection.

During these long exposures several of Uranus’s satellites moved
noticeably, leaving bright trails on the image. (NASA; ESA; and M. Showalter,
SETI Institute)

The two faint rings discovered in 2005 (see Figure 14-10) are
different: They lie well outside Uranus’s Roche limit. The outer
of these two rings owes its existence to a miniature satellite called
Mab (named for a diminutive fairy in English folklore) that orbits within this ring. Meteorites colliding with Mab knock dust
off the satellite’s surface. Since Mab is so small (just 36 km in diameter) and hence has little gravity, the ejected dust escapes from

The Shaded Side of Uranus’s Rings This view from Voyager 2, taken
when the spacecraft was in Uranus’s shadow, looks back toward the Sun.
Numerous fine-grained dust particles gleam in the spaces between the
main rings. This dust is probably debris from collisions between larger
particles in the main rings. The short horizontal streaks are star images
blurred by the spacecraft’s motion during the exposure. (NASA/JPL)

In 2002 and 2003, a team led by Imke de Pater of the University of California, Berkeley, used the 10-meter Keck telescope
in Hawaii to observe in detail the rings of Neptune. Remarkably,
they found that all of the rings had become fainter since the Voyager 2 flyby in 1989. Apparently, the rings are losing particles
faster then new ones are being added. If the rings continue to decay at the same rate, one of them may vanish completely within
a century. More research into the nature of Neptune’s rings is
needed to explain this curious and rapid decay.

The inner of the two faint rings may be formed in the same way;
however, no small satellite has yet been found within this ring.

The Decaying Rings of Neptune

Uranus’s Unusual Moderate-Sized Satellites
Umbriel and Oberon both appear to be geologically dead worlds,
with surfaces dominated by impact craters. By contrast, Ariel’s
surface appears to have been cracked at some time in the past, allowing some sort of ice lava to flood low-lying areas. A similar
process appears to have taken place on Titania. This geologic activity may be due to a combination of the satellites’ internal heat
and tidal heating like that which powers volcanism on Jupiter’s
satellite Io (see Section 13-4). Io’s tidal heating is only possible
because of the 1:2:4 ratio of the orbital periods of Io, Europa, and
Ganymede. While there are no such simple ratios between the

Like Uranus, Neptune is surrounded by a system of thin, dark
rings that were first detected in stellar occultations. Figure 14-12
is a Voyager 2 image of Neptune’s rings. The ring particles vary
in size from a few micrometers (1 ␮m ⫽ 10⫺6 m) to about 10 meters. As for Uranus’s rings, the particles that make up Neptune’s
rings reflect very little light because they have undergone radiation darkening.

Before the Voyager 2 flyby of Uranus, five moderate-sized
satellites—Titania, Oberon, Ariel, Umbriel, and Miranda—were
known to orbit the planet (Figure 14-13). Most are named after
sprites and spirits in Shakespeare’s plays. They range in diameter
from about 1600 km (1000 mi) for Titania and Oberon to less
than 500 km (300 mi) for Miranda. All these moons have average densities around 1500 kg/m3, which is consistent with a mixture of ice and rock.
Voyager 2 discovered 11 other small Uranian satellites, most
of which have diameters of less than 100 km (60 mi); 11 more
were found using ground-based telescopes and the Hubble Space
Telescope between 1997 and 2003. Only Jupiter and Saturn have
more known satellites than Uranus. Figure 14-14 shows several
of the smaller satellites. Appendix 3 summarizes information
about all 27 known moons of Uranus.

Uranus’s Rings and Small Satellites This false-color infrared image
from the Hubble Space Telescope shows eight of Uranus’s satellites, all of
which were discovered by Voyager 2 when it flew past Uranus in 1986.
They all lie within 86,000 km of the planet’s center (only about one-fifth
of the distance from the Earth to our Moon) and all are less than 160 km
(100 mi) in diameter. The arcs show how far each satellite moves around
its orbit in 90 minutes. (Erich Karkoschka, University of Arizona; and NASA)

present-day orbital periods of Uranus’s satellites, there may have
been in the past. If so, tidal heating could have helped reshape the
surfaces of some of the satellites.
Unique among Uranus’s satellites is Miranda, which has a
landscape unlike that of any other world in the solar system.
Much of the surface is heavily cratered, as we would expect for
a satellite only 470 km in diameter, but several regions have unusual and dramatic topography (Figure 14-15). Detailed analysis
of Miranda’s geology suggests that
this satellite’s orbital period was Uranus’s satellite
once in a whole-number ratio with
Miranda has cliffs twice
that of more massive Umbriel or
Ariel. The resulting tidal heating as high as Mount Everest
melted Miranda’s interior, causing
dense rocks in some locations on the surface to settle toward the
satellite’s center as blocks of less dense ice were forced upward
toward the surface, thus creating Miranda’s resurfaced terrain.
Tidal heating must have ceased before this process could run its
full course, which explains why some ancient, heavily cratered regions remain on Miranda’s surface.

Uranus’s Perplexing Small Satellites
While Uranus’s small satellites are unlikely to show the kind of
geology found in Miranda, some of them move in curious orbits.
Eight of the nine small satellites in large orbits beyond Oberon
are in retrograde orbits: They go around Uranus oppositely to the
direction in which Uranus rotates. Many of the small outer satellites of Jupiter and Saturn have retrograde orbits and are proba-

Miranda This composite of Voyager 2 images shows that part
of Miranda’s surface is ancient and heavily cratered, while
other parts are dominated by parallel networks of valleys and ridges. At
the very bottom of the image—where a “bite” seems to have been taken
out of Miranda—is a range of enormous cliffs that jut upward to an
elevation of 20 km, twice as high as Mount Everest. (NASA/JPL)

bly captured asteroids (see Section 13-9 and Section 13-10); the
same is probably true of the outer satellites of Uranus.
The 13 satellites that orbit closest to Uranus (inside the orbit
of Miranda) are all in prograde orbits, so they travel around
Uranus in the same direction as the planet rotates. However,
when Mark Showalter and Jack Lissauer compared 11 of these
satellites’ orbits in 2005 with their orbits in 1994, they found surprisingly large differences. (The other two inner satellites were
only discovered in 2003, so it is not known whether their orbits
underwent similar changes.) These satellites can pass within a few
thousand to a few hundred kilometers from each other, so they
can exert strong gravitational forces on each other. Over time
these forces can modify their orbits. The magnitude of the orbital
changes is such that the inner satellites will begin colliding with
each other within a few million years. If these inner satellites
are in such unstable orbits, is it possible that they have been in
orbit around Uranus since it formed more than 4.5 billion years
ago? Or did Uranus somehow acquire these satellites in the relatively recent past? More research will be needed to answer these
questions.

14-8 Neptune’s satellite Triton is an
icy world with a young surface and
a tenuous atmosphere
Neptune has 13 known satellites, listed in Appendix 3. They are
named for mythological beings related to bodies of water. (Neptune itself is named for the Roman god of the sea.) Most of these

Uranus, Neptune, Pluto, and the Kuiper Belt: Remote Worlds

worlds are small, icy bodies, probably similar to the smaller satellites of Uranus. The one striking exception is Triton, Neptune’s
largest satellite (see Table 7-2). In many ways Triton is quite unlike any other world in the solar system.

Triton’s Backward Orbit and Young Surface
Like many of the small satellites of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and
Neptune, Triton is in a retrograde orbit, so that it moves around
Neptune oppositely to the direction of Neptune’s rotation. Furthermore, the plane of Triton’s orbit is inclined by 23° from the
plane of Neptune’s equator. It is difficult to imagine how a satellite might form out of the same cloud of material as a planet and
end up orbiting in a direction opposite the planet’s rotation and
in such a tilted plane. Hence, Triton probably formed elsewhere
in the solar system, collided long ago with a now-vanished satellite of Neptune, and was captured by Neptune’s gravity. With a
diameter of 2706 km, a bit smaller than our Moon but much
larger than any other satellite in a retrograde orbit, Triton is certainly the largest captured satellite.
Figure 14-16 shows the icy, reflective surface of Triton as imaged by Voyager 2. There is a conspicuous absence of large craters,
which immediately tells us that Triton has a young surface on
which the scars of ancient impacts have largely been erased by
tectonic activity. There are areas that resemble frozen lakes and
may be the calderas of extinct ice volcanoes. Some of Triton’s sur-

Cantaloupe terrain

Dark, windblown

face features resemble the long cracks seen on Europa (Section
13-6) and Ganymede (Section 13-7). Still other features are unique
to Triton. For example, in the upper portion of Figure 14-16 you
can see dimpled, wrinkled terrain that resembles the skin of a
cantaloupe.
Triton’s tectonically active history is probably related to its
having been captured into orbit around Neptune. After its capture, Triton most likely started off in a highly elliptical orbit, but
today the satellite’s orbit is quite circular. The satellite’s original
elliptical orbit would have been made circular by tidal forces exerted on Triton by Neptune’s gravity. These tidal forces would
also have stretched and flexed Triton, causing enough tidal heating to melt much of the interior. The resulting volcanic activity
(with lavas made of ice rather than molten rock) would have
obliterated Triton’s original surface features, including craters.
There may still be warmth in Triton’s interior today. Voyager 2
observed plumes of dark material being ejected from the surface
to a height of 8 km (5 mi). These plumes may have been generated from a hot spot far below Triton’s surface, similar to geysers
on the Earth. Alternatively, the energy source for the plumes may
be sunlight that warms the surface, producing subsurface pockets
of gas and creating fissures in the icy surface through which the
gas can escape.
Triton’s surface temperature is only 38 K (⫺235°C ⫽
⫺391°F), the lowest of any world yet visited by spacecraft. This
temperature is low enough to solidify nitrogen, and indeed the
spectrum of sunlight reflected from Triton’s surface shows absorption lines due to nitrogen ice as well as methane ice. But Triton is also warm enough to allow some nitrogen to evaporate
from the surface, like the steam that rises from ice cubes when
you first take them out of the freezer. Voyager 2 confirmed that
Triton has a very thin nitrogen atmosphere with a surface pressure of only 1.6 ⫻ 10⫺5 atmosphere, about the same as at an altitude of 100 km above the Earth’s surface. Despite its thinness,
Triton’s atmosphere has noticeable effects. Voyager 2 saw areas
on Triton’s surface where dark material has been blown downwind by a steady breeze (see Figure 14-16). It also observed dark
material ejected from the geyserlike plumes being carried as far as
150 km by high-altitude winds.

Some of this presumably evaporates when summer comes to the south
pole; the northward flow of the evaporated gas may cause the dark
surface markings. Farther north is a brown area of “cantaloupe terrain”
that resembles the skin of a melon. (NASA/JPL)

Just as tidal forces presumably played a large role in Triton’s history, they also determine its future. Triton raises a tidal bulge
on Neptune, just as our Moon distorts the Earth (recall Figure
10-17). In the case of the Earth-Moon system, the gravitational
pull of the Earth’s tidal bulge causes the Moon to spiral away
from the Earth. But because Triton’s
orbit is retrograde, the tidal bulge Within 100 million years
on Neptune exerts a force on Triton
Triton will be torn apart
that makes the satellite slow down
rather than speed up. (In Figure by Neptune’s tidal forces
10-17, imagine that the moon is orbiting toward the bottom of the figure rather than toward the
top.) This is causing Triton to spiral gradually in toward Neptune. In approximately 100 million years, Triton will be inside
Neptune’s Roche limit, and the satellite will eventually be torn to
pieces by tidal forces. When this happens, the planet will develop

368

Chapter 14

a spectacular ring system—overshadowing by far its present-day
set of narrow rings—as rock fragments gradually spread out along
Triton’s former orbit.
Prior to Voyager 2, only one other satellite was known to orbit Neptune. Nereid, which was first sighted in 1949, is in a prograde orbit. Hence, it orbits Neptune in the direction opposite to
Triton. Nereid also has the most eccentric orbit of any satellite in
the solar system; its distance from Neptune varies from 1.4 million to 9.7 million kilometers. One possible explanation is that
when Triton was captured by Neptune’s gravity, the interplay of
gravitational forces exerted on Nereid by both Neptune and Triton moved Nereid from a relatively circular orbit (like those of
Neptune’s other, smaller moons) into its present elliptical one.

14-9 Pluto is smaller than any planet
Speculations about worlds beyond Neptune date back to the late
1800s, when a few astronomers suggested that Neptune’s orbit
was being perturbed by an unknown object. Encouraged by the
fame of Adams and Le Verrier, several people set out to discover
“Planet X.” Two prosperous Boston gentlemen, William Pickering and Percival Lowell, were prominent in this effort. (Lowell
also enthusiastically promoted the idea of canals on Mars; see
Section 11-4.) Modern calculations show that there are, in fact,
no unaccounted perturbations of Neptune’s orbit. It is thus not
surprising that no orbiting body was found at the positions predicted by Pickering, Lowell, and others. Yet the search continued.

Before he died in 1916, Lowell urged that a special
camera with a wide field of view be constructed to help
search for Planet X. After many delays, the camera was
finished in 1929 and installed at the Lowell Observatory in
Flagstaff, Arizona, where a young astronomer, Clyde W.
Tombaugh, had joined the staff to carry on the project. On February 18, 1930, Tombaugh finally discovered the long-sought object. It was disappointingly faint—a thousand times dimmer than
the dimmest object visible with the naked eye and 250 times dimmer than Neptune at opposition—and presented no discernible

disk. The new world was named for Pluto, the mythological god
of the underworld; fittingly, this name has Percival Lowell’s initials as its first two letters. The discovery was publicly announced
on March 13, 1930, the 149th anniversary of the discovery of
Uranus. The two photographs in Figure 14-17 show one day’s
motion of Pluto.
Pluto’s orbit about the Sun is more elliptical (eccentricity
0.2501) and more steeply inclined to the plane of the ecliptic
(17.15°) than the orbit of any of the planets. In fact, Pluto’s orbit is so eccentric that it is sometimes closer to the Sun than Neptune. This was the case from 1979 until 1999; indeed, when Pluto
was at perihelion in 1989, it was more than 108 km closer to the
Sun than was Neptune. Happily, the orbits of Neptune and Pluto
are such that the two worlds will never collide.
Pluto is so far away that it subtends only a very small angle
of 0.15 arcsec. Hence, it is extraordinarily difficult to resolve any
of its surface features. But by observing Pluto with the Hubble
Space Telescope over the course of a solar day on Pluto (6.3872
Earth days) and using computer image processing, Alan Stern and
Marc Buie generated the maps of Pluto’s surface shown in Figure
14-18. These maps show bright polar ice caps as well as regions
of different reflectivity near the planet’s equator. Observations of
Pluto’s rotation confirm that the planet’s rotation axis is tipped
by more than 90°, so that Pluto has retrograde rotation like
Uranus.

Pluto’s Satellites
In 1978, while examining some photographs of Pluto, James W.
Christy of the U.S. Naval Observatory noticed that the image of
the planet on a photographic plate appeared slightly elongated, as
though Pluto had a lump on one side. He promptly examined a
number of other photographs of Pluto, and found a series that
showed the lump moving clockwise around Pluto with a period
of about 6 days.
Christy concluded that the lump was actually a satellite of
Pluto. He proposed that the newly discovered moon be christened
Charon (pronounced KAR-en), after the mythical boatman who
ferried souls across the River Styx to Hades, the domain ruled by
Pluto. (Christy also chose the name because of its similarity to
Charlene, his wife’s name.) The average distance between Charon

Pluto’s Motion across the Sky Pluto was discovered in 1930 by
searching for a dim, starlike object that moves slowly in relation to the
background stars. These two photographs were taken one day apart. Even

when its apparent motion on the celestial sphere is fastest, Pluto moves
only about 1 arcmin per day relative to the stars. (Lick Observatory)

and Charon added together. The brightness variations during
eclipses suggest that Charon has a bright southern polar cap.
The average densities of Pluto and Charon, at about 2000
kg/m3, are essentially the same as that of Triton (2070 kg/m3). All
three worlds are therefore probably composed of a mixture of
rock and ice, as we might expect for small bodies that formed in
the cold outer reaches of the solar nebula.
Pluto’s spectrum shows absorption lines of various solid ices
that cover the planet’s surface, including nitrogen (N2), methane
(CH4), and carbon monoxide (CO). Stellar occultation measurements have shown that Pluto, like Triton, has a very thin atmosphere. Exposed to a daytime temperature of around 40 K, N2
and CO ices turn to gas more easily than frozen CH4. For this
reason, most of Pluto’s tenuous atmosphere probably consists of
N2 and CO. Charon’s weaker gravity has apparently allowed
most of the N2, CH4, and CO to escape into space; only water
ice is found on its surface.

The Origin of Pluto’s Satellites
Computer processing shows dark and
bright areas on the two hemispheres.

Pluto and Charon are remarkably like each other in mass, size,
and density. Throughout the rest of the solar system, planets are
many times larger and more massive than any of their satellites.

Pluto’s Surface The bright regions at the top and bottom of each of
Pluto’s hemispheres may be polar ice caps. The bright regions nearer the
equator may be impact basins where more reflective subsurface ice has
been exposed. (Alan Stern, Southwest Research Institute; Marc Buie, Lowell

and Pluto is a scant 19,640 km, less than 5% of the distance between the Earth and our Moon. The best pictures of Pluto and
Charon have been obtained using the Hubble Space Telescope
(HST). In 2005 a team of astronomers using HST discovered two
additional, smaller satellites that orbit Pluto at two to three times
the distance of Charon (Figure 14-19).
Observations show that Charon’s orbital period of 6.3872
days is the same as the rotational period of Pluto and the rotational period of Charon. In other
words, both Pluto and Charon ro- Pluto and its satellite
tate synchronously with their orbital
Charon both rotate in
motion, and so both always keep the
lockstep, always keeping
same face toward each other. As seen
from the Charon-facing side of the same faces toward
Pluto, the satellite remains perpetu- each other
ally suspended above the horizon.
Likewise, Pluto neither rises nor sets as seen from Charon.
Soon after the discovery of Charon, astronomers witnessed
an alignment that occurs only once every 124 years. From 1985
through 1990, Charon’s orbital plane appeared nearly edge-on as
seen from the Earth, allowing astronomers to view mutual eclipses
of Pluto and its moon. As the bodies passed in front of each other,
their combined brightness diminished in ways that revealed their
sizes and surface characteristics. Data from the eclipses combined
with subsequent measurements give Pluto’s diameter as about
2274 km and Charon’s as about 1190 km. For comparison, our
Moon’s diameter (3476 km) nearly equals the diameters of Pluto

Chapter 14

The exceptional similarities between Pluto and Charon suggest to
some astronomers that this binary system probably formed when
Pluto collided with a similar body. Perhaps chunks of matter were
stripped from the second body, leaving behind a mass, now called
Charon, that was captured into orbit by Pluto’s gravity. This
same collision probably also left behind the small satellites Nix
and Hydra shown in Figure 14-19.
In support of this model is the observation that all three satellites have almost the same color and reflection spectrum, suggesting a common origin. Pluto, by contrast, has a redder color than
its satellites, which is consistent with the idea that Pluto and the
satellites formed in different ways.
For this scenario to be feasible, there must have been many
Plutolike objects in the outer regions of the solar system. Astronomers estimate that in order for a collision or close encounter
between two of them to have occurred at least once since the solar system formed some 4.56 billion years ago, there must have
been at least a thousand Plutos. As we will see, astronomers have
begun to discover this population of Plutolike objects in the dark
recesses of the solar system beyond Neptune.

14-10 Pluto is just one of thousands of icy
objects that orbit the Sun beyond Neptune
For many years astronomers attempted to find other worlds beyond Neptune using the same technique used to discover Pluto
(see Figure 14-17). The first to succeed were David Jewitt and
Jane Luu, who in 1992 found an object with a semimajor axis of
42 AU and a diameter estimated to be only 240 km. This object,
named 1992 QB1, has a reddish color like Pluto, possibly because
frozen methane has been degraded by eons of radiation exposure.
As of this writing (2006), more than 1100 more trans-Neptunian
objects—icy worlds whose orbits have semimajor axes larger than
that of Neptune—have been discovered. Most of these are relatively small like 1992 QB1, but a number are larger than Charon
and one is larger than Pluto itself (Figure 14-20). Thus, Pluto is
by no means unique: We can best regard it as a particularly large
(but not the largest) trans-Neptunian object rather than a planet.
With improvements in the sensitivity of telescopes, new objects beyond Neptune are being discovered at a rapid pace; 67
new trans-Neptunian objects were found in 2005 alone. Based on
these observations, it is thought that there could be 35,000 or
more objects beyond Neptune with diameters greater than 100 km.
One of the larger objects could have collided with Pluto in the
past, giving rise to Pluto’s retinue of satellites (see Section 14-9).
At least 29 trans-Neptunian objects have satellites, which suggests
that such collisions have taken place many times.

Most of the trans-Neptunian objects lie within the
Kuiper belt, which extends from about 30 to 50 AU
from the Sun and is relatively close to the ecliptic.
When the solar system was young, a large number of icy planetesimals formed in the region beyond Jupiter. Over time, the gravitational forces of the massive Jovian planets pushed most of these
planetesimals beyond Neptune’s orbit, concentrating them into a

The Largest Trans-Neptunian Objects This artist’s impression depicts
the Earth and the largest objects known beyond Neptune (as of 2006)

2900 km versus 2274 km for Pluto. Note the differences in color among
these objects and that three of them (Eris, Pluto, and 2003 EL61) have
satellites of their own. Table 7-4 in Section 7-5 lists the properties of

belt centered on the plane of the ecliptic. Most of the transNeptunian objects within the belt are in orbits that are only
slightly inclined to the ecliptic; these are thought to have formed
beyond Neptune and to be in roughly their original orbits. Other
objects such as 2005 FY9 and 2003 EL61 (see Figure 14-20 and
Table 7-4) are in orbits that are inclined by about 30° from the
ecliptic. These are thought to have been pushed into their steeply
inclined orbits by gravitational interactions with Neptune.
The processes that gave rise to the Kuiper belt in our solar
system also appear to have taken place around other stars. Figure
14-21 shows a disk of material surrounding the young star HD
139664. This disk has dimensions comparable to our Kuiper belt.
A number of other young stars have been found with disks of this
same type.
There are relatively few members of the Kuiper belt between
the orbits of Neptune and Pluto. Remarkably, there are about
100 objects that have nearly the same semimajor axis as Pluto.
These so-called plutinos, which include Pluto itself, have the property that they complete nearly two
orbits around the Sun in the same Neptune’s gravity shapes
time that Neptune completes three
the orbits of many icy
orbits. The plutinos thus experience
rhythmic gravitational pulls from worlds, including Pluto
Neptune, and these pulls keep them
in their orbits. (In Section 13-1 we saw a similar relationship
among the orbital periods of Jupiter’s satellites Io, Europa, and
Ganymede, though the ratio of their orbital periods is 1:2:4 rather

A “Kuiper Belt” Around Another Star The star HD 139664 is only
slightly more massive than the Sun but is thought to be just 300 million
years old. This Hubble Space Telescope image shows a ring of material
around HD 139664 that is similar in size to the Kuiper belt in our solar

belt objects orbit at distances beyond the plutinos but within
about 50 AU from the Sun, at which distance an object completes
one orbit for every two orbits of Neptune. At this distance the
rhythmic gravitational forces of Neptune appear to pull small objects inward, giving the Kuiper belt a relatively sharp outer edge.

Two examples of trans-Neptunian objects that are
not members of the Kuiper belt are shown in Figure
14-20. Eris, the largest known trans-Neptunian object,
has a semimajor axis of more than 67 AU and an orbital eccentricity of 0.442. This orbit takes Eris from inside the orbit of
Pluto to far beyond the Kuiper belt. An even more extreme case
is Sedna: Its orbital semimajor axis is 489 AU, giving it an orbital
period of more than 10,000 years, and the orbital eccentricity has
the remarkably high value of 0.844. It is not well understood how
Sedna could have been moved into such an immense and elongated orbit.

Excitement about the worlds beyond Neptune has motivated the development of a spacecraft called New
Horizons. Launched in 2006, New Horizons swung by
Jupiter in 2007 and will make the first-ever flyby of Pluto and
Charon in 2015. It will then be aimed toward one or two other
targets in the Kuiper belt. The choice of targets will not be made
until a year before the Pluto-Charon flyby, giving astronomers extra time to discover new members of the Kuiper belt that might

Discovery of the Outer Planets: Uranus was discovered by chance,
while Neptune was discovered at a location predicted by applying Newtonian mechanics. Pluto was discovered after a long
search.
Atmospheres of Uranus and Neptune: Both Uranus and Neptune
have atmospheres composed primarily of hydrogen, helium, and
a few percent methane.
• Methane absorbs red light, giving Uranus and Neptune their
greenish-blue color.
• No white ammonia clouds are seen on Uranus or Neptune. Presumably the low temperatures have caused almost all the ammonia to precipitate into the interiors of the planets. All of these
planets’ clouds are composed of methane.
• Much more cloud activity is seen on Neptune than on Uranus.
This is because Uranus lacks a substantial internal heat source.
Interiors and Magnetic Fields of Uranus and Neptune: Both
Uranus and Neptune may have a rocky core surrounded by a
mantle of water and ammonia. Electric currents in these mantles
may generate the magnetic fields of the planets.
• The magnetic axes of both Uranus and Neptune are steeply inclined from their axes of rotation. The magnetic and rotational
axes of all the other planets are more nearly parallel. The magnetic fields of Uranus and Neptune are also offset from the centers of the planets.
Uranus’s Unusual Rotation: Uranus’s axis of rotation lies nearly
in the plane of its orbit, producing greatly exaggerated seasonal
changes on the planet.
• This unusual orientation may be the result of a collision with a
planetlike object early in the history of our solar system. Such a
collision could have knocked Uranus on its side.
Ring Systems of Uranus and Neptune: Uranus and Neptune are
both surrounded by systems of thin, dark rings. The low reflectivity of the ring particles may be due to radiation-darkened
methane ice.
Satellites of Uranus and Neptune: Uranus has five satellites similar to the moderate-sized moons of Saturn, plus at least 22 more
small satellites. Neptune has 13 satellites, one of which (Triton)
is comparable in size to our Moon or the Galilean satellites of
Jupiter.

• Triton has a young, icy surface indicative of tectonic activity.
The energy for this activity may have been provided by tidal heating that occurred when Triton was captured by Neptune’s gravity into a retrograde orbit.
• Triton has a tenuous nitrogen atmosphere.
Worlds Beyond Neptune: Pluto and its moon, Charon, move together in a highly elliptical orbit steeply inclined to the plane of
the ecliptic.
• More than a thousand icy worlds have been discovered beyond
Neptune. Pluto and Charon are part of this population.
• Most trans-Neptunian objects lie in a band called the Kuiper
belt that extends from 30 to 50 AU from the Sun. Neptune’s gravity shapes the orbits of objects within the Kuiper belt.

calculate the fraction by which the sunward gravitational pull
on Uranus is reduced by Neptune at that configuration. Based
on your calculations, do you expect that Neptune has a relatively large or relatively small effect on Uranus’s orbit?
At certain points in its orbit, a stellar occultation by Uranus
would not reveal the existence of the rings. What points are
those? How often does this circumstance arise? Explain using a diagram.
According to one model for the internal structure of Uranus,
the rocky core and the surrounding shell of water and methane
ices together make up 80% of the planet’s mass. This interior region extends from the center of Uranus to about 70%
of the planet’s radius. (a) Find the average density of this interior region. (b) How does your answer to (a) compare with
the average density of Uranus as a whole? Is this what you
would expect? Why?
Uranus’s epsilon (␧) ring has a radius of 51,150 km. (a) How
long does it take a particle in the ␧ ring to make one complete orbit of Uranus? (b) If you were riding on one of the
particles in the ␧ ring and watching a cloud near Uranus’s
equator, would the cloud appear to move eastward or westward as Uranus rotates? Explain your answer.
Suppose you were standing on Pluto. Describe the motions of
Charon relative to the Sun, the stars, and your own horizon.
Would you ever be able to see a total eclipse of the Sun?
(Hint: You will need to calculate the angles subtended by
Charon and by the Sun as seen by an observer on Pluto.) In
what circumstances would you never see Charon?
It is thought that Pluto’s tenuous atmosphere may become
even thinner as the planet moves toward aphelion (which it
will reach in 2113), then regain its present density as it again
moves toward perihelion. Why should this be?
The brightness of sunlight is inversely proportional to the
square of the distance from the Sun. For example, at a distance of 4 AU from the Sun, sunlight is only (1/4)2 ⫽ 1/16 ⫽
0.0625 as bright as at 1 AU. Compared with the brightness
of sunlight on the Earth, what is its brightness (a) on Pluto
at perihelion (29.649 AU from the Sun) and (b) on Pluto at
aphelion (49.425 AU from the Sun)? (c) How much brighter
is it on Pluto at perihelion compared with aphelion? (Even
this brightness is quite low. Noon on Pluto is about as dim
as it is on the Earth a half hour after sunset on a moonless
night.)
If Earth-based telescopes can resolve angles down to 0.25
arcsec, how large could a trans-Neptunian object be at Pluto’s
average distance from the Sun and still not present a resolvable disk?
The observations of Pluto shown in Figure 14-19 were made
using blue and ultraviolet light. What advantages does this
have over observations made with red or infrared light?
Calculate the maximum angular separation between Pluto
and Charon as seen from Earth. Assume that Pluto is at perihelion (29.649 AU from the Sun) and that Pluto is at opposition as seen from Earth.
Presumably Pluto and Charon raise tidal bulges on each other.
Explain why the average distance between Pluto and Charon
is probably constant, rather than increasing like the Earth-

answer.
(a) Find the semimajor axis of the orbit of an object whose
period is 3/2 of the orbital period of Neptune. How does
your result compare to the semimajor axis of Pluto’s orbit?
(b) A number of Kuiper belt objects called plutinos have been
discovered with the same orbital period and hence the same
semimajor axis as Pluto. Explain how these objects can avoid
colliding with Pluto.
Find the semimajor axis of the orbit of an object whose period is twice the orbital period of Neptune. How does your
result compare to the outer limit of the Kuiper belt?
Suppose you wanted to search for trans-Neptunian objects.
Why might it be advantageous to do your observations at infrared rather than visible wavelengths? (Hint: At visible wavelengths, the light we see from planets is reflected sunlight. At
what wavelengths would you expect distant planets to emit
their own light most strongly? Use Wien’s law to calculate
the wavelength range best suited for your search.) Could such
observations be done at an observatory on the Earth’s surface? Explain.
The New Horizons spacecraft will swing by Jupiter to get a
boost from that planet’s gravity, enabling it to reach Pluto
relatively quickly. To see what would happen if this technique were not used, consider a spacecraft trajectory that is
an elliptical orbit around the Sun. The perihelion of this orbit is at 1 AU from the Sun (at the Earth) and the aphelion
is at 30 AU (at Pluto’s position). Calculate how long it would
take a spacecraft in this orbit to make the one-way trip from
Earth to Pluto. Based on the information in Section 14-10,
how much time is saved by making a swing by Jupiter instead?

Discussion Questions

during the early history of our solar system.
45. Some scientists are discussing the possibility of placing spacecraft in orbit about Uranus and Neptune. What kinds of data
should be collected, and what questions would you like to see
answered by these missions?
46. If Triton had been formed along with Neptune rather than
having been captured, would you expect it to be in a prograde or retrograde orbit? Would you expect the satellite to
show signs of tectonic activity? Explain your answers.
47. Would you expect the surfaces of Pluto and Charon to be
heavily cratered? Explain why or why not.
48. Imagine that you are in charge of planning the New Horizons
flyby of Pluto and Charon. In your opinion, what data should
be collected and what kinds of questions should the mission
attempt to answer?
49. In 2006 the International Astronomical Union changed Pluto’s
designation from planet to dwarf planet. One criterion that
Pluto failed to meet was that a planet must have “cleared the
neighborhood” around its orbit. In what sense has Pluto not
done so? In what sense have the eight planets (Mercury

with this criterion?

After William Herschel’s discovery of Uranus in 1781 (which we
described in Section 14-1), many astronomers began to wonder if
there were other, as yet undiscovered, planets. If these planets
were too dim to be seen by the naked eye, they might still be visible through telescopes. These planets would presumably be found
close to the plane of the ecliptic, because all the other planets orbit the Sun in or near that plane (see Section 7-1). But how far
from the Sun might these additional planets be found?

fire, this “star” hung in the night sky for weeks. Some, including the English king Harold, may have taken it as an ill omen;
others, such as Harold’s rival William, Duke of Normandy, may
have regarded it as a sign of good fortune. Perhaps they were both
right, because by the end of the year Harold was dead and William
was installed on the English throne.
Neither man ever knew that he was actually seeing the trail
of a city-sized ball of ice and dust, part of which evaporated as it
rounded the Sun to produce a long tail. They were seeing a
comet—remarkably, the same Comet Halley that last appeared in
1986 and will next be seen in 2061. Although we now understand
that comets are natural phenomena rather than supernatural
omens, they still have the power to awe and inspire us, as did
Comet Hale-Bopp (shown here) in 1997.
While comets are made of ice and dust, asteroids are rocky
bits of the solar nebula that never formed into a full-sized planet.
Some asteroids break into fragments, as do some comets, and
some of these fragments fall to the Earth as meteorites. On extraordinarily rare occasions, an entire asteroid strikes Earth. Such

Ceres Compared with the Earth and Moon A drawing of Ceres, the
largest of the asteroids and the first one discovered, is shown here to

considered a planet, and it cannot be regarded as a moon because it
does not orbit any other body. To denote their status, asteroids are also

the ecliptic and is somewhat more eccentric. Pallas is even smaller
and dimmer than Ceres, with an estimated diameter of only
522 km. Obviously, Pallas was also not the missing planet.
Did the missing planet even exist? Some astronomers speculated that perhaps there had once been such a full-size planet, but
it had somehow broken apart or exploded to produce a population of asteroids orbiting between Mars and Jupiter. The search
was on to discover this population. Two more such asteroids
were discovered in the next few years, Juno in 1804 and Vesta in
1807. Several hundred more were discovered beginning in the
mid-1800s, by which time telescopic equipment and techniques
had improved.

An Abundance of Asteroids
The next major breakthrough came in 1891, when the German
astronomer Max Wolf began using photographic techniques to
search for asteroids. Before this, asteroids had to be painstakingly
discovered by scrutinizing the skies for faint, uncharted, starlike
objects whose positions move slightly from one night to the next.
With photography, an astronomer simply aims a camera-equipped
telescope at the stars and takes a long exposure. If an asteroid
happens to be in the field of view, its orbital motion during the
long exposure leaves a distinctive trail on the photographic
plate (Figure 15-2). Using this technique, Wolf alone discovered
228 asteroids.

Today, more than 300,000 asteroids have been discovered, of which 100,000 have been studied well enough
so that their orbits are known. About 5000 more are
discovered every month, some by amateur astronomers. After the
discoverer reports a new find to the Minor Planet Center of the
Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, the new asteroid is given

Ceres orbits the Sun once every 4.6 years at an average distance of 2.77 AU, just where astronomers had
expected to find the missing planet. But Ceres is very
small; its equatorial diameter is a mere 974.6 km (Figure 15-1).
(The pole-to-pole diameter is even smaller, just 909.4 km.) Hence,
Ceres reflects only a little sunlight, which is why it cannot be seen
with the naked eye even at opposition; it can be seen with binoculars, but it looks like just another faint star. Because of its small
size, it is known today as a minor planet, or asteroid.
On March 28, 1802, Heinrich Olbers discovered another
faint, starlike object that moved against the background stars. He
called it Pallas, after the Greek goddess of wisdom. Like Ceres,
Pallas orbits the Sun every 4.6 years at an average distance of
2.77 AU, but its orbit is more steeply inclined from the plane of

the next, the semimajor axis of the orbit increases by a factor between approximately 1.4 and 2. For example, the semimajor axis
of Mercury’s orbit is 0.39 AU. Venus’s orbit has a semimajor axis
of 0.72 AU, which is larger by a factor of (0.72)/(0.39) ⫽ 1.85.
(Unlike Newton’s laws, the Titius-Bode “Law” is not a fundamental law of nature. It is probably just a reflection of how our
solar system happened to form.)
The glaring exception is Jupiter (semimajor axis 5.20 AU),
which is more than 3 times farther from the Sun than Mars (semimajor axis 1.52 AU). Table 7-1 depicts this large space between
the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. If the rule of thumb is correct, astronomers reasoned, there should be a “missing planet” with an
orbit about 1.4 to 2 times larger than that of Mars. This planet
should therefore have a semimajor axis between 2 and 3 AU.
Six German astronomers, who jokingly called themselves the
“Celestial Police,” organized an international group to begin a
careful search for this missing planet. Before their search got under way, however, surprising news reached them from Giuseppe
Piazzi, a Sicilian astronomer. Piazzi had been carefully mapping
faint stars in the constellation of Taurus when on January 1,
1801, the first night of the nineteenth century, he noticed a dim,
previously uncharted star. This star’s position shifted slightly over
the next several nights. Suspecting that he might have found the
“missing planet,” Piazzi excitedly wrote to Johann Bode, the director of the Berlin Observatory and a member of the Celestial
Police.
Unfortunately, Piazzi’s letter did not reach Bode until late
March. By that time, the Earth had moved around its orbit so that
Piazzi’s object appeared too near the Sun to be visible in the night
sky. With no way of knowing where to look after it emerged from
the Sun’s glare, astronomers feared that Piazzi’s object might have
been lost.
Upon hearing of this dilemma, the brilliant young German
mathematician Karl Friedrich Gauss took up the challenge. He
developed a general method of computing an object’s orbit from
only three separate measurements of its position on the celestial
sphere. (With slight modifications, this same method is used by astronomers today.) In November 1801, Gauss predicted that Piazzi’s
object would be found in the predawn sky in the constellation of
Virgo. And indeed Piazzi’s object was sighted again on December
31, 1801, only a short distance from the position Gauss had calculated. Piazzi named the object Ceres (pronounced SEE-reez), after the patron goddess of Sicily in Roman mythology.

The Asteroid Belt
Like Ceres, Pallas, Vesta, and Juno, most asteroids orbit the Sun
at distances between 2 and 3.5 AU. This region of our solar system between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter is called the asteroid
belt (Figure 15-3).

The Trail of an Asteroid Telescopes used to photograph the stars are
motorized to follow the apparent motion of the celestial sphere. Because
asteroids orbit the Sun, their positions change with respect to the stars,
and they leave blurred trails on time exposure images of the stars. This
bluish asteroid trail was recorded quite by accident by the Hubble Space
Telescope. (R. Evans and K. Stapelfeldt, Jet Propulsion Laboratory; and NASA)

a provisional designation. For example, asteroid 1980 JE was the
fifth (“E”) to be discovered during the second half of May (the
tenth half-month of the year, “J”) 1980. The same scheme for
provisional designations is also used for small objects found in the
outer solar system beyond Neptune, or trans-Neptunian objects
(see Section 14-10).
If the asteroid is located again on at least four succeeding
oppositions—a process that can take decades—the asteroid is assigned an official sequential number (Ceres is 1, Pallas is 2, and
so forth), and the discoverer is given the privilege of suggesting a
name for the asteroid. The suggested name must then be approved by the International Astronomical Union. For example,
the asteroid 1980 JE was officially named 3834 Zappafrank (after the American musician Frank Zappa) in 1994.
Ceres—or, in modern nomenclature, 1 Ceres—is unquestionably the largest asteroid; it has about 25% of the mass of all the
asteroids combined. In recognition of its size, 1 Ceres is also
called a dwarf planet, a designation that it shares with the large
trans-Neptunian objects Eris and Pluto (see Section 14-10).
Besides 1 Ceres, only two asteroids—2 Pallas, and 4 Vesta—
have diameters greater than 300 km. Thirty other asteroids have
diameters between 200 and 300 km, and 200 more are bigger
than 100 km across. The vast majority of asteroids are less than
1 km across.

Voyager 2, Galileo, and Cassini were able to cross the asteroid
belt to reach Jupiter or Saturn. Aren’t asteroids hazards to space
navigation, as they are sometimes depicted in sciencefiction movies? Wouldn’t these spacecraft have been likely to
run into an asteroid? Happily, the
answer to both questions is no! Science-fiction movies to

than 105 asteroids, they are spread
over a belt with a total area (as are not hazards to space
seen from above the plane of navigation
the ecliptic) of about 1017 square
kilometers—about 108 times greater than the Earth’s entire surface area. Hence, the average distance between asteroids in the
ecliptic plane is about 106 kilometers, about twice the distance
between the Earth and Moon. Furthermore, many asteroids
have orbits that are tilted out of the ecliptic. The Galileo spacecraft did pass within a few thousand kilometers of two asteroids, but these passes were intentional and required that the
spacecraft be carefully aimed.

EX

A typical simulation starts off with a billion (109) or so planetesimals, each with a mass of 1015 kg or more, so that their combined mass equals that of the terrestrial planets. The computer
then follows these planetesimals as they collide and accrete to
form the planets. By selecting different speeds and positions for
the planetesimals at the start of the simulation, a scientist can
study alternative scenarios of the development of the inner solar
system.
If the effects of Jupiter’s gravity are not included in a simulation, an Earth-sized planet usually forms in the asteroid belt,
giving us five terrestrial planets instead of four. But when Jupiter’s

strong pull “clears out” the asteroid
belt by disrupting the orbits of planetesimals in the belt, ejecting
most of them from the solar system altogether. As a result, the asteroid belt becomes depleted of planetesimals before a planet has
a chance to form. The few planetesimals that remain in the
simulation—only a small fraction of those that originally orbited
between Mars and Jupiter—become the asteroids that we see today.
Jupiter’s gravitational influence, however, probably cannot
explain why asteroid orbits have the wide variety of semimajor
axes, eccentricities, and inclinations to the ecliptic shown in
Figure 15-3. Even with the influence of Jupiter, collisions between
planetesimals in the solar nebula would have left the asteroids in
roughly circular orbits close to the ecliptic plane, like the orbits
of the planets. Therefore, something else must have “stirred up”
the asteroids to put them into their current state. Recent analyses
suggest that one or more Mars-sized objects—that is, terrestrial
planets intermediate in size between the Earth and the Moon—
did in fact form within the asteroid belt. Planetesimals that passed
within close range of these Mars-sized objects would have experienced strong gravitational forces, and these forces could have
deflected the planetesimals into the eccentric or inclined orbits
that many asteroids follow today.

Orbit of Earth

Jupiter and the Formation of the Asteroid Belt

Jupiter’s gravity continues to influence the asteroid belt down to
the present day. The American astronomer Daniel Kirkwood
found the first evidence for this in 1867, when he discovered gaps
in the asteroid belt. These features, today called Kirkwood gaps,
can best be seen in a histogram like Figure 15-4, which shows asteroid orbital periods. The gaps in this histogram show regions
where there are relatively few asteroids. Curiously, these gaps occur for asteroid orbits whose periods are simple fractions (such as
1/3, 2/5, 3/7, and 1/2) of Jupiter’s orbital period.
To understand why the Kirkwood gaps exist, imagine an asteroid within the belt that circles the Sun once every 5.93 years,
exactly half of Jupiter’s orbital period. On every second trip
around the Sun, the asteroid finds itself lined up between Jupiter

ER

Where did the asteroid belt come from? Why did asteroids, rather
than a planet, form in the solar nebula (see Section 8-5) in the region between Mars and Jupiter? Important insights into these
questions come from supercomputer simulations of the formation
of the terrestrial planets, like the one depicted in Figure 8-12 but
more elaborate.

15-2 Jupiter’s gravity helped shape the
asteroid belt

Mars-sized objects would also have helped clear out the asteroid belt by deflecting planetesimals into orbits that crossed
Jupiter’s orbit. Once a planetesimal wandered close to Jupiter, it
could be ejected from the solar system by the giant planet’s gravitational force.
In this scheme, the Mars-sized objects disappeared when gravitational forces from Jupiter either accelerated them out of the solar system entirely or caused them to slow down and fall into the
Sun. A Mars-sized object colliding with the Earth is thought to
have produced the Moon (see Figure 10-18). Perhaps this object
was an “escapee” from the asteroid belt.

Number of known asteroids

What of the nineteenth-century notion of a missing planet?
This idea has long since been discarded, because the combined
matter of all the asteroids (including an estimate for those not yet
officially known) would produce an object barely 1500 km in diameter. This is considerably smaller than anything that could be
considered a missing planet. We now understand that asteroids
are actually debris left over from the formation of the solar
system.

and the Sun, always at the same location and with the same orientation. Because of these repeated alignments, called a 2-to-1
resonance, Jupiter’s gravity deflects the asteroid from its original
5.93-year orbit, ultimately ejecting it from the asteroid belt. Similar resonances help clear out the Cassini division in Saturn’s rings
(see Section 12-11), drive the tidal heating of Jupiter’s moon Io
(see Section 13-4), and give an outer edge to the Kuiper belt beyond Neptune (see Section 14-10). According to Kepler’s third
law, a period of 5.93 years corresponds to a semimajor axis of
3.28 AU. Because of Jupiter’s gravity, almost no asteroids orbit
the Sun at this average distance.
Another Kirkwood gap corresponds to an orbital period of
one-third Jupiter’s period, or 3.95 years (a 3-to-1 resonance). Additional gaps exist for other simple ratios between the periods of
asteroids and Jupiter. Any Mars-sized bodies that existed in the
asteroid belt were probably ejected after wandering into one of
the Kirkwood gaps.

State-of-the-art optical telescopes have good enough resolution to
reveal surface details on large asteroids such as 1 Ceres, 2 Pallas,
and 4 Vesta (Figure 15-5). These asteroids resemble miniature terrestrial planets. They have enough mass, and hence enough gravity, to pull themselves into roughly spherical shapes. These large
asteroids are likely to have extensively cratered surfaces due to
collisions with other asteroids in the asteroid belt.
Optical telescopes reveal much less detail about the smaller
asteroids. But by studying how the brightness of an asteroid
changes as it rotates, astronomers can infer the asteroid’s shape.
An elongated asteroid appears dimmest when its long axis points
toward the Sun so that it presents less of its surface to reflect sunlight. By contrast, a rotating spherical asteroid will have a more
constant brightness. Such observations show that most smaller asteroids are not spherical at all. Instead, they retain the odd shapes
produced by previous collisions with other asteroids.
An important recent innovation in studying asteroids has been
the use of radar. An intense radio beam is sent toward an asteroid, and the reflected signal is detected and analyzed to determine

ably a “rubble pile” of small fragments that fit together loosely.
Billions of years of impacts have totally shattered this asteroid.
But the impacts were sufficiently gentle that the resulting fragments drifted away relatively slowly, only to be pulled back onto
the asteroid by gravitational attraction.
Another surprising discovery is that some asteroids have extremely large craters, comparable in size to the asteroid itself. An
example is the immense crater on Mathilde, shown in Figure
15-7. The object that formed this crater probably collided with
Mathilde at a speed of 1 to 5 km/s (3600 to 18,000 km/h, or
2000 to 11,000 mi/h), which is more than sufficient to shatter
rock. Why didn’t this collision break the asteroid completely
apart, sending the pieces flying in all directions? The explanation
may be that the asteroid had already been broken into a loose collection of fragments before this major impact took place. Such a
fragmented asteroid can more easily absorb the energy of a collision than can a solid, rocky one.

ANALOGY If you fire a rifle bullet at a wine glass, the glass will
shatter into tiny pieces. But if you fire the same bullet into a bag

glass), the main damage will be a hole in the bag. In a similar
way, an asteroid that is a collection of small pieces can survive
a major impact more easily than can a solid asteroid.

later went into orbit around 433 Eros (see Figure 7-7) and touched
down on Eros in 2001. It was the first spacecraft to orbit and
land on an asteroid. A number of other spacecraft have since
made close flybys of asteroids.
One of the most ambitious asteroid missions to date is

2007 the Dawn spacecraft was scheduled to be launched on a
mission that would place it in orbit around 4 Vesta in 2011 and

Collisions and the Nature of Asteroids
What have spacecraft and Earth-based radar told us about the asteroids? To appreciate the answer, we should first consider what
scientists expected to find with these new tools. A few years ago,
the consensus among planetary scientists was that the smaller asteroids were solid, rocky objects. The surfaces were presumed to
be cratered by impacts, but only relatively small craters were expected. The reason is that an impact forceful enough to make a
very large crater would probably fracture a rocky asteroid into
two or more smaller asteroids.
The truth proves to be rather different. It is now suspected
that most asteroids larger than about a kilometer are not entirely
solid, but are actually composed of several pieces. An extreme example is Mathilde (see Figure 15-7). This asteroid has such a low
density (1300 kg/m3) that it cannot be made of solid rock, which
typically has densities of 2500 kg/m3 or higher. Instead, it is prob-

gether to capture asteroids at two locations outside the asteroid
belt called the stable Lagrange points. One of these points is onesixth of the way around Jupiter’s orbit ahead of the planet, while
the other point is the same distance behind the planet (Figure
15-9a). The French mathematician Joseph Louis Lagrange predicted the existence of these points in 1772; asteroids were first
discovered there in 1906.
The asteroids trapped at Jupiter’s Lagrange points are called
Trojan asteroids, named individually after heroes of the Trojan
War. More than 1600 Trojan asteroids have been catalogued so
far (see Figure 15-9b). (Four objects have also been found at the
Lagrange points of Neptune. These are icy trans-Neptunian objects rather than rocky asteroids.)

In some cases a collision that produces a rubble-pile asteroid
can eject a piece that goes into orbit around the asteroid. This
may explain why a handful of asteroids are known to have satellites. There is even one known case of an asteroid with two satellites, like a miniature planetary system (Figure 15-8).
If a collision is sufficiently energetic, it may shatter an asteroid permanently. Evidence for this was first pointed out in 1918
by the Japanese astronomer Kiyotsugu Hirayama. He drew attention to families of asteroids that share nearly identical orbits.
Each of these groupings, now called Hirayama families, presumably resulted from a parent asteroid that was broken into fragments by a high-speed, high-energy collision with another asteroid.

While the majority of asteroids lie within the asteroid belt, there
are some notable exceptions. A few actually share the same orbit
as Jupiter. Other asteroids venture well inside the orbit of Mars,
and can pose a serious threat to life on Earth.

The Lagrange Points and Trojan Asteroids

depletes certain orbits in the asteroid belt, forming the Kirkwood
gaps. But the gravitational forces of the Sun and Jupiter work to-

Some asteroids have highly elliptical orbits that bring
them into the inner regions of the solar system. Asteroids that cross Mars’s orbit, or whose orbits lie completely within that of Mars, are called near-Earth objects or NEOs.
These are shown in red in Figure 15-9b.
Occasionally, a near-Earth object may pass relatively close to
the Earth. On October 30, 1937, Hermes passed the Earth at a
distance of 900,000 km (560,000 mi), only a little more than
twice the distance to the Moon. One of the closest calls to date
occurred on December 9, 1994, when an asteroid called 1994

The Barringer Crater This 1.2-km-(3⁄4-mi-) wide crater was
formed by a meteoroid impact about 50,000 years ago. Fewer
than 200 other impact craters between 3 and 150 km across have been
identified on the Earth. None of these is more than 500 million years old,
because the reshaping of the Earth’s surface by erosion and by tectonic
processes tends to erase craters over time. (Meteor Crater Enterprises)

More than 4100 near-Earth objects are known, and there
may be thousands more that we have not yet detected. Fortunately, space is a big place and the Earth is a rather small target,
so asteroids strike the Earth only very rarely.
However, collisions between asteroids produce numerous
smaller chunks of rock, and many of these do eventually rain
down on the terrestrial planets. Fortunately for us, the majority
of these fragments, usually called meteoroids, are quite small. But
on rare occasions a large fragment collides with our planet. When
such a collision takes place, the result is an impact crater whose
diameter depends on the mass and speed of the impinging object.
A relatively young, pristine terrestrial impact crater is the
Barringer Crater near Winslow, Arizona (Figure 15-10). This
crater was formed 50,000 years ago when an iron-rich object approximately 50 m across struck the ground at a speed of more
than 11 km/s (40,000 km/h, or 25,000 mi/h). The resulting blast
was equivalent to the detonation of a 20-megaton hydrogen bomb
and left a crater 1.2 km (3⁄4 mi) wide and 200 m (650 ft) deep at
its center. (Figure 7-10b shows a much larger but much older
crater in Canada.)

Working at a site of exposed

Mountains in Italy, the Alvarez team probably ended the age
discovered an exceptionally high of dinosaurs 65 million
abundance of iridium in a dark- years ago
colored layer of clay between limestone strata (Figure 15-11). Since this discovery in 1979, a comparable layer of iridium-rich material has been uncovered at
numerous sites around the world. In every case, geological dating
reveals that this apparently worldwide layer of iridium-rich clay
was deposited about 65 million years ago.
Paleontologists were quick to realize the significance of this
date, because it was 65 million years ago that all the dinosaurs
rather suddenly became extinct. In fact, more than 75% of all the
species on the Earth disappeared within a relatively brief span
of time.
The Alvarez discovery suggests a startling explanation for
this dramatic mass extinction: Perhaps an asteroid hit the Earth
at that time. An asteroid 10 km in diameter slamming into our
planet would have produced a fiery plume that ignited tremendous wildfires, killing untold numbers of animals and consuming
much of the Earth’s vegetation. The dust thrown up from the impact and soot from wildfires hung in the atmosphere, blackening
the sky for months after the impact. The dust eventually drifted
to the ground, forming a worldwide layer of iridium-rich clay.
(Evidence for this picture is that a layer of soot 65 million years
old is also found at various sites around the world. From the
thickness of this layer, scientists calculate that the wildfires produced nearly 70 billion tons of soot.) Temperatures would have
plummeted due to the blocking out of sunlight by dust and soot,
only to increase later due to global warming brought on by greenhouse gases (see Section 9-1 and Section 9-7) released by the wildfires. The Cosmic Connections figure depicts the sequence of
events that may have followed the asteroid impact.

Iridium and the Demise of the Dinosaurs
Iron is an important constituent of asteroids and meteoroids. Another element, iridium, is common in iron-rich minerals but rare
in other types of rocks. Measurements of iridium in the Earth’s
crust can thus tell us the rate at which meteoritic material has
been deposited on the Earth over the ages. The geologist Walter
Alvarez and his physicist father, Luis Alvarez, from the University of California, Berkeley, made such measurements in the late
1970s.

There is compelling evidence that 65 million years ago the Earth was
struck by an asteroid about 10 km in diameter. This impact triggered a
biological cataclysm that wiped out 75 percent of all plant and animal
species on our planet. (From “The Day the World Burned” by D. A. Kring

The Day Before

Late Cretaceous swamps and rivers in North America
had a mix of coniferous, broad-leaved evergreen, and
deciduous trees. They formed canopied forests and
open woodlands with understories of ferns, aquatic
plants and flowering shrubs.
40 Minutes

The vapor-rich plume of material expanded to
envelop Earth. As material in that plume fell back to
the ground, it streaked through the atmosphere like
trillions of meteors, heating it in some places by
hundreds of degrees.

One Year

The postimpact environment was less diverse. Ferns
and algae were the first to recover. Plant species in
swamps and swamp margins generally survived
better than species in other types of ecosystems.
Conifers fared particularly badly.

Impact

The Chicxulub Impact occurred in a shallow sea and
immediately lofted rocky, molten and vaporous debris
into the atmosphere. The bulk of the debris rained
down on nearby continental regions, but much of it
rose all the way into space.
One Week

After fires had ravaged the landscape, only a few
stark trunks and skeletons remained. Soot from the
fires and dust from the impact slowly settled to the
ground. Sunlight was dramatically, if not totally,
attenuated for months.

50 Years

Shrubs took advantage of the vacant landscape and
began to cover it. Species pollinated by the wind did
better than those that relied on insects. Trees began
to grow, but it took years for forest canopies to
rebuild. The recovery time is uncertain.

Tiny rodentlike creatures capable of ferreting out seeds and
nuts were among the animals that managed to survive this catastrophe, setting the stage for the rise of mammals in the eons that
followed. As the dominant mammals on the planet, we may owe
our very existence to an ancient asteroid.

In 1992 a team of geologists suggested that this asteroid crashed into a site in Mexico. They based this conclusion on glassy debris and violently shocked grains
of rock ejected from the 180-km-diameter Chicxulub Crater on
the Yucatán Peninsula. Using radioactive dating techniques (see
Section 8-3 and Box 8-1), the scientists found that the asteroid
struck 64.98 million years ago, in remarkable agreement with the
age of the iridium-rich layer of clay.
Some geologists and paleontologists are not convinced that
an asteroid impact led to the extinction of the dinosaurs. But
many scientists agree that this hypothesis fits the available evidence better than any other explanation that has been offered
so far.

Tunguska and the Threat of Asteroid Impact
On June 30, 1908, a spectacular explosion occurred over the
Tunguska region of Siberia that released about 1015 joules of energy, equivalent to a nuclear detonation of several hundred kilotons. The blast knocked a man off his porch some 60 km away
and could be heard more than 1000 km away. Millions of tons
of dust were injected into the atmosphere, darkening the sky as
far away as California.
Preoccupied with political upheaval and World War I, Russia did not send a scientific expedition to the site until 1927. Researchers found that trees had been seared and felled radially
outward in an area about 50 km in diameter (Figure 15-12).
There was no clear evidence of a crater. In fact, the trees at
“ground zero” were left standing upright, although they were
completely stripped of branches and leaves.
Several teams of modern astronomers have argued that the
Tunguska explosion was caused by an asteroid traveling at supersonic speed. They arrived at this conclusion after assessing the effects of various impactor sizes, speeds, and compositions. Even
data from above-ground nuclear detonations of the 1940s and
1950s were worked into the calculations. The Tunguska event
is well-matched by an asteroid about 80 m (260 ft) in diameter
entering the Earth’s atmosphere at 22 km/s (80,000 km/h ⫽
50,000 mph).

Large objects, such as that which formed the Chicxulub Crater and may have led to the demise of the dinosaurs, occasionally strike the Earth with the
destructive force of as much as a million megatons of TNT. An
asteroid 1 or 2 kilometers in diameter, striking the Earth at
30 km/s, would destroy an area the size of California. Such an
impact would throw more than 1013 kg of microscopic dust particles into the atmosphere, which would decrease the amount of
sunlight reaching the Earth’s surface by enough to threaten the
health of the world’s agriculture. The loss of a year’s crops could
lead to the demise of a quarter of the world’s population and

would place our civilization—although perhaps not the survival
of our species—in grave jeopardy.
The good news is that such large objects strike the Earth very
infrequently. An asteroid 1 km in diameter might be expected to
hit the Earth only once every 300,000 years. Statistically, the
probability that an average person will die because of such an
event is about 1 in 20,000, or only about 1% as great as the probability of dying in an automobile accident. While the threat of asteroid or comet impact exists, a catastrophic impact is very
unlikely to occur in our lifetimes.

15-5 Meteorites are classified as stones,
stony irons, or irons, depending on
their composition
Asteroids can only be studied at close range using spacecraft. But
from time to time pieces of asteroids fall to Earth where they can
be examined by scientists. These asteroid fragments are called
meteorites.

Meteoroids, Meteors, and Meteorites
A meteoroid, like an asteroid, is a chunk of rock in space. There
is no official dividing line between meteoroids and asteroids, but
the term asteroid is generally applied only to objects larger than
50 m across.

remarked, “I could more easily believe that two Yankee professors could lie than that stones could fall from Heaven.” Although
several falling meteorites had been widely witnessed and specimens from them had been collected, many scientists were reluctant to accept the idea that rocks could fall to the Earth from
outer space. Conclusive evidence for the extraterrestrial origin of
meteorites came on April 26, 1803, when fragments pelted the
French town of L’Aigle. This event was analyzed by the noted
physicist Jean-Baptiste Biot, and his conclusions helped finally to
convince scientists that meteorites were indeed extraterrestrial.

Types of Meteorites

Figure 15-13

RI V UXG

A Meteor A meteor is produced when a meteoroid—a piece of
interplanetary rock or dust—strikes the Earth’s atmosphere at high speed
(typically 5 to 30 km/s). The heat of air friction makes the meteoroid
glow as it disintegrates. Most meteoroids burn up completely at altitudes
of 100 km (60 mi) or so. This long exposure (notice the star trails) shows
an exceptionally bright meteor called a fireball. (Courtesy of R. A. Oriti)

A meteor is the brief flash of light (sometimes called a shooting star) that is visible at night when a meteoroid enters the
Earth’s atmosphere (Figure 15-13). Frictional heat is generated as
the meteoroid plunges through the atmosphere, leaving a fiery
trail across the night sky.

If a piece of rock survives its fiery descent through the
atmosphere and reaches the ground, it is called a meteorite. As incredible as it may seem, an estimated total of 300 tons of extraterrestrial matter falls on the Earth each
day. Most of this is dust rather than meteorites, however, and is
hardly noticeable. It is fortunate that large meteorite falls are
rather rare events, because these fastmoving rock fragments can cause Studying meteorites

the ground (Figure 15-14). Because
they are so rare, meteorites are the asteroids from which
prized by scientists and collectors they came
alike. Almost all meteorites are asteroid fragments and thus provide information about the chemical composition of asteroids. A very few meteorites have been
identified as pieces of the Moon or Mars that were blasted off the
surfaces of those worlds by asteroid impacts and eventually landed
on the Earth.
People have been finding specimens of meteorites for thousands of years, and descriptions of them appear in ancient Chinese, Greek, and Roman literature. Many civilizations have
regarded meteorites as objects of veneration. The sacred Black
Stone, enshrined at the Ka’aba in the Great Mosque at Mecca,
may be a relic of a meteorite impact.
The extraterrestrial origin of meteorites was hotly debated
until as late as the eighteenth century. Upon hearing a lecture by
two Yale professors, President Thomas Jefferson is said to have

Meteorites are classified into three broad categories: stones, stony
irons, and irons. As their name suggests, stony meteorites, or
stones, look like ordinary rocks at first glance, but they are sometimes covered with a fusion crust (Figure 15-15a). This crust is
produced by the melting of the meteorite’s outer layers during its
fiery descent through the atmosphere. When a stony meteorite is
cut in two and polished, tiny flecks of iron can sometimes be
found in the rock (Figure 15-15b).
Although stony meteorites account for about 95% of all the
meteoritic material that falls to the Earth, they are the most difficult meteorite specimens to find. If they lie undiscovered and become exposed to the weather for a few years, they look almost
indistinguishable from common terrestrial rocks. (The asteroid
that caused the Tunguska explosion, described in Section 15-4,
was probably of stony composition—which would account for
the lack of obvious meteoritic debris on the ground.) Meteorites
with high iron content can be found much more easily, because
they can be located with a metal detector. Consequently, iron and
stony iron meteorites dominate most museum collections.

Stony Meteorites Of all meteorites that fall on the Earth, 95% are
stones. (a) Many freshly discovered specimens, like the one shown here,
are coated with dark fusion crusts. This particular stone fell in Texas.

Stony iron meteorites consist of roughly equal amounts of
rock and iron. Figure 15-16, for example, shows the mineral
olivine suspended in a matrix of iron. Only about 1% of the meteorites that fall to the Earth are stony irons.
Iron meteorites (Figure 15-17), or irons, account for about
4% of the material that falls on the Earth. Iron meteorites usually contain no stone, but many contain from 10% to 20% nickel.
Before humans began extracting iron from ores around 2000 B.C.,
the only source of the metal was from iron meteorites. Because
these are so rare, iron was regarded as a precious metal like gold
or silver.

collection of R. A. Oriti)

In 1808, Count Alois von Widmanstätten, director of the Imperial Porcelain Works in Vienna, discovered a conclusive test for
the most common type of iron meteorite. About 75% of all iron
meteorites have a unique crystalline structure. These Widmanstätten patterns (pronounced VIT-mahn-shtetten) become visible
when the meteorite is cut, polished, and briefly dipped into a dilute solution of acid (Figure 15-17b). Nickel-iron crystals of this
type can form only if the molten metal cools slowly over many
millions of years. Therefore, Widmanstätten patterns are never
found in counterfeit meteorites, or “meteorwrongs.”

Meteorites and the Early History of Asteroids
Widmanstätten patterns suggest that some asteroids were originally at least partly molten inside and remained partly molten
long after they were formed. As soon as an asteroid accreted from
planetesimals some 4.56 billion years ago, rapid decay of shortlived radioactive isotopes could have heated the asteroid’s interior
to temperatures above the melting point of rock. If the asteroid
was large enough—at least 200 to 400 km in diameter—to insulate the interior and prevent cooling, the interior would have remained molten over the next few million years and chemical
differentiation would have occurred (see Box 7-1 and Section
8-5). Iron and nickel would have sunk toward the asteroid’s center, forcing less dense rock upward toward the asteroid’s surface.
Like a terrestrial planet, such a differentiated asteroid would
have a distinct core and crust. After a differentiated asteroid
cooled and its core solidified, collisions with other asteroids would
have fragmented the parent body into meteoroids. Iron meteorites
are therefore specimens from a differentiated asteroid’s core, while
stony irons come from regions between a differentiated asteroid’s
core and its crust.
Unlike irons and stony irons, stony meteorites may or may
not come from differentiated asteroids. Smaller asteroids would

not have retained their internal heat long enough for chemical differentiation to occur. Some stony meteorites are fragments of
such undifferentiated asteroids (also called primitive asteroids),
while others are relics of the crust of differentiated asteroids.

15-6 Some meteorites retain traces of the
early solar system
A class of rare stony meteorites called carbonaceous chondrites
shows no evidence of ever having been melted as part of asteroids. As suggested by their name, carbonaceous chondrites contain substantial amounts of carbon and carbon compounds,
including complex organic molecules and as much as 20% water
bound into the minerals. These compounds would have been broken down and the water driven out if these meteorites had been
subjected to heating and melting. Carbonaceous chondrites may
therefore be samples of the original material from which our solar system was created. The asteroid 253 Mathilde, shown in Figure 15-7, has a very dark gray color and the same sort of spectrum
as a carbonaceous chondrite. It, too, is likely composed of material that predates the formation of the solar system.
Amino acids, the building blocks of proteins upon which terrestrial life is based, are among the organic compounds occasionally found inside carbonaceous chondrites. Interstellar organic
material has thus probably been falling on our planet since its formation. Some scientists suspect that carbonaceous chondrites may
have played a role in the origin of life on Earth.
Shortly after midnight on February 8, 1969, the night sky
around Chihuahua, Mexico, was illuminated by a brilliant bluewhite light moving across the heavens. As the light crossed the
sky, it disintegrated in a spectacular, noisy explosion that dropped
thousands of rocks and pebbles over terrified onlookers. Within
hours, teams of scientists were on their way to collect specimens
of a carbonaceous chondrite, collectively named the Allende meteorite after the locality (Figure 15-18).
Specimens were scattered in an elongated ellipse approximately 50 km long by 10 km wide. Most fragments were coated

with a fusion crust, but minerals immediately beneath the crust
showed no signs of damage. Surface material is peeled away as it
becomes heated during flight through the atmosphere; this process
forms the fusion crust. Because the heat has little time to penetrate the meteorite’s interior, compounds there are left intact.
One of the most striking discoveries to come from the Allende meteorite was evidence suggesting that a nearby star exploded into a supernova about 4.6 billion years ago. In a
supernova, a massive star reaches the end of its life cycle and
blows itself apart in a cataclysm that hurls matter outward at
tremendous speeds (see Figure 1-8). During this detonation, violent collisions between nuclei produce a host of radioactive elements, including 26Al, a radioactive isotope of aluminum.

Researchers found clear evidence for the former presence of
in the Allende meteorite. Chemical analyses revealed a high
abundance of a stable isotope of magnesium (26Mg), which is
produced by the radioactive decay of 26Al. Some astronomers interpret this as evidence for a supernova in our vicinity at about
the time the Sun was born. Indeed, by compressing interstellar gas
and dust, the supernova’s shock wave may have triggered the
birth of our solar system.

Just as heat from the protosun produced two classes of planets,
the terrestrial and the Jovian, two main types of small bodies
formed in the solar system. Near the Sun, interplanetary debris
consists of the rocky objects called asteroids or meteoroids. Far
from the Sun, where temperatures in the early solar system were
low enough to permit ices of water, methane, ammonia, and carbon dioxide to form, interplanetary debris took the form of loose
collections of ices and small rocky particles. These objects are like
icy versions of “rubble pile” asteroids such as 253 Mathilde,
which we described in Section 15-3. The Harvard astronomer
Fred Whipple, who devised this model in 1950, called them “icy
conglomerates” or “dirty snowballs.” Some of these “snowballs”
are trans-Neptunian objects that orbit forever in the outer regions
of the solar system. Some of them, however, are in noncircular
orbits that take them inward toward the Sun, where the ice begins to evaporate. These objects are known as comets.

Kuiper belt objects and asteroids travel around the Sun
along roughly circular orbits that lie close to the plane
of the ecliptic. In sharp contrast, comets travel around
the Sun along highly elliptical orbits inclined at random angles to
the ecliptic. Comets are just a few kilometers across, so when they
are far from the Sun they are difficult to spot with even a large
telescope. As a comet approaches the Sun, however, solar heat begins to vaporize the comet’s ices, liberating gases as well as dust
particles. The liberated gases begin to glow, producing a fuzzy,
luminous ball called a coma that is typically 1 million km in diameter. Some of these luminous gases stream outward into a long,
flowing tail. This tail, which can be more than 100 million kilometers in length—comparable to the distance from the Earth to
the Sun—is one of the most awesome sights that can be seen in
the night sky (see Figure 15-19 and the image that opens this

and dust that typically measures a few kilometers across. Before
1986, no one had seen the nucleus of a comet. It is small, dim,
and buried in the glare of the coma. In that year, the first closeup pictures of a comet’s nucleus were obtained by a spacecraft
that flew past Comet Halley (Figure 15-21a). Comet Halley’s
potato-shaped nucleus is darker than coal, reflecting only about
4% of the light that strikes it. This dark color is probably caused
by a layer of carbon-rich compounds and dust that is left behind
as the comet’s ice evaporates.
Several 15-km-long jets of dust particles were seen emanating from bright areas on Halley’s nucleus. These seem to be active only when exposed to the Sun. The bright areas, which
probably cover about 10% of the surface of the nucleus, are presumably places where the dark layer covering the nucleus is particularly thin. When exposed to the Sun, these areas evaporate
rapidly, producing the jets. When the nucleus’s rotation brings the
bright areas into darkness, away from the Sun, the jets shut off.

A few other comet nuclei have been imaged at close range
at spacecraft. The best images to date have come from
the Deep Impact spacecraft, which flew to within 500 km
of Comet Tempel 1 in 2005 (Figure 15-21b). As it approached,
Deep Impact launched a 372-kg copper projectile that slammed
into the surface of the nucleus at 37,000 km/h (23,000 mi/h). The
collision excavated about 11,000 tons of material from the nucleus. The character of the ejected material confirmed that the nucleus of Tempel 1 is a “rubble pile” held together not by chemical
forces between its component parts (like a chocolate chip cookie)
but by the gravitational forces between those parts.
The Deep Impact mission also measured the mass and hence
the density of the comet nucleus. The very low density of
600 kg/m3 (60% of the density of water) shows that the nucleus
cannot be solid. It is best regarded as a porous jumble of rock,
fine dust, and ice.
An even more ambitious mission to explore a comet is the
European Space Agency’s Rosetta. This spacecraft was lunched in
2004 and is scheduled to fly past at least one asteroid on its way

to intercept Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko in 2014. If all
goes well, Rosetta will go into orbit around the comet nucleus
and release a small probe that will actually land on the nucleus.

Comet Envelopes and Comet Tails
A part of a comet that is not visible to the human eye is the hydrogen envelope, a huge sphere of tenuous gas surrounding the
nucleus. This hydrogen comes from water molecules (H2O) that
escape from the comet’s evaporating ice and then break apart
when they absorb ultraviolet photons from the Sun. The hydrogen atoms also absorb solar ultraviolet photons, which excite the
atoms from the ground state into an excited state (see Section
5-8). When the atoms return to the ground state, they emit ultraviolet photons.
Unfortunately for astronomers, these emissions from a
comet’s hydrogen envelope cannot be detected by Earth-based telescopes because our atmosphere is largely opaque to ultraviolet
light (see Section 6-7). Instead, cameras above the Earth’s atmosphere must be used. Figure 15-22 shows two views of the same
comet, one as it appeared in visible light to Earth-based observers
and one as photographed by an ultraviolet camera aboard a
rocket. The ultraviolet image shows the enormous extent of the
hydrogen envelope, which can span 10 million kilometers.
As the diagram in Figure 15-20 suggests, comet tails always
point away from the Sun. This is true regardless of the direction of
the comet’s motion (Figure 15-23).
The implication that something from A comet’s tail does not

tion 8-5). A decade later, in 1962,
Biermann’s prediction was confirmed when the solar wind was
detected for the first time by instruments on the Mariner 2 spacecraft (see Figure 11-15).

Comet’s orbit

Sun

Perihelion

Figure 15-23
The Orbit and Tail of a Comet The solar wind and the pressure of
sunlight blow a comet’s dust particles and ionized atoms away from the
Sun. Consequently, a comet’s tail points generally away from the Sun. In
particular, the tail does not always stream behind the nucleus. At the
upper right of this figure, the comet is moving upward along its orbit and
is literally chasing its own tail.

In fact, the Sun usually produces two comet tails—an ion tail
and a dust tail (Figure 15-24). Ionized atoms and molecules—that
is, atoms and molecules missing one or more electrons—are swept
directly away from the Sun by the solar wind to form the relatively straight ion tail. The distinct blue color of the ion tail is
caused by emissions from carbon-bearing molecules such as CN
and C2. The dust tail is formed when photons of light strike dust
particles freed from the evaporating nucleus. (Figure 8-6 shows a
dust particle of this type.) Light exerts a pressure on any object
that absorbs or reflects it. This pressure, called radiation pressure,
is quite weak but is strong enough to make fine-grained dust particles in a comet’s coma drift away from the comet, thus producing a dust tail. The solar wind has less of an effect on dust particles
than on (much smaller) ions, so the dust tail ends up being curved
rather than straight. On rare occasions a comet is oriented in such
a way that its dust tail appears to stick out in front of the comet
(Figure 15-25).
After the comet passes perihelion, it recedes from the Sun
back into the cold regions of the outer solar system. The ices stop
vaporizing, the coma and tail disappear, and the comet goes back
into an inert state—until the next time its orbit takes it toward
the inner solar system. An object in an elliptical orbit spends most
of its time far from the Sun, so it is only during a relatively brief
period before and after perihelion that a comet can have a prominent tail. An example is Comet Halley, which orbits the Sun
along a highly elliptical path that stretches from just inside the
Earth’s orbit to slightly beyond the orbit of Neptune (Figure
15-26). The comet’s tail is visible to the naked eye or with binoc-

ulars only during a few months around perihelion, which last occurred in 1986 and will happen again in 2061.
Other comets have orbits that are larger and more elongated,
with even longer periods. The orbit of Comet Hyakutake (see Figure 15-19) takes it to a distance of about 2000 AU from the Sun,
50 times the size of Pluto’s orbit, with an orbital period of around
30,000 years!

front of the comet. (European Southern Observatory)

Figure 15-26
Comet Halley’s Eccentric Orbit Like most comets, Comet

Halley has an elongated orbit and spends most of its time far
from the Sun. Figure 4-23 shows the comet’s tail, which appears only
when the comet is close to perihelion. Comet Halley has been observed at
intervals of about 76 years—the period of its orbit—since 88 B.C. (see
Section 4-7).

Both comets and Kuiper belt objects are mixtures of ice and rock
that must have formed in the outer solar system. (Had they formed
in the warm inner solar system, they would not have included
ices.) But most Kuiper belt objects have relatively circular orbits
that lie close to the plane of the ecliptic, while comets have very
elongated orbits that are often steeply inclined to the ecliptic.
What gives comets their distinctive orbits? As we will see, the answer to this question depends on whether the comet’s orbital period is relatively short or relatively long.

Jupiter-Family Comets and the Kuiper Belt
As we saw in Section 14-10, the gravitational effects of Neptune
shape the orbits of objects in the Kuiper belt. Most of these objects are found between the orbit of Pluto (where an object makes
two orbits for every three orbits of Neptune) and about 50 AU
from the Sun (where an object makes one orbit for every two orbits of Neptune).
However, collisions between Kuiper belt objects can break
off relatively small chunks. Gravitational perturbations from Neptune can occasionally launch one of these chunks into a highly elliptical orbit that takes it close to the Sun. When one of these
chunks approaches the Sun, it develops a visible tail and appears
as a comet. These are called Jupiter-family comets because their
orbits tend to be influenced strongly by Jupiter’s gravitational
pull. Jupiter-family comets orbit the Sun in fewer than 20 years.
One example is Comet Tempel 1 (see Figure 15-21b), which has
an orbital period of 5.5 years.
There may be tens of thousands of objects in the Kuiper belt
that could eventually be perturbed into an elongated orbit and become comets. It is thought that a few of these refugees from the
Kuiper belt have been captured by the gravitational pull of Saturn,
becoming that planet’s small outer satellites (see Section 13-10).

Intermediate-Period Comets, Long-Period Comets, and
the Oort Cloud
The majority of comets are intermediate-period comets, with orbital periods between 20 and 200 years, and long-period comets,
which take more than 200 years to complete one orbit of the Sun.
Comet Halley, shown in Figure 15-21a, has an orbital period of
76 years and so is an intermediate-period comet; Comet Hyakutake (see Figure 15-19) is a long-period comet that takes more
than 70,000 years to complete one orbit.

ity of the newly formed Jovian planets. During near-collisions
with the giant planets, many of these chunks of ice and dust were
catapulted by gravity into highly elliptical orbits, in much the
same way that Pioneer and Voyager spacecraft were flung far
from the Sun during their flybys of the Jovian planets. Gravitational perturbations from nearby stars could have tilted the planes
of the orbits in all directions, giving the Oort cloud its spherical
shape.

The Oort cloud
(comprising many
billions of comets)

Figure 15-27
The Kuiper Belt and the Oort Cloud Objects in the Kuiper belt orbit
close to the plane of the ecliptic. The Oort cloud, by contrast, is a
spherical distribution of icy objects whose orbits are randomly oriented
relative to the ecliptic. (NASA and A. Field/Space Telescope Science

The distinction between long-period, intermediate-period, and
Jupiter-family comets can be blurred by the effects of gravitational perturbations. During a return trip toward the Sun, an encounter with a Jovian planet may force a comet into a much
larger orbit. Alternatively, such an encounter can move a longperiod comet into a smaller orbit (Figure 15-28). Several comets
have been perturbed in this way into orbits that always remain
within the inner solar system. One such is Comet Tempel 1 (see
Figure 15-21b), whose orbit extends from the orbit of Mars out
to the orbit of Jupiter.
Our description of cometary origins suggests that different
comets are of different ages. Computer simulations suggest that
many Jupiter-family comets were produced no more than a few
hundred million years ago by collisions between larger icy objects
in the Kuiper belt. Comets emanating from the Oort cloud may

Long-period comets travel along extremely elongated orbits
and consequently spend most of their time at distances of roughly
104 to 105 AU from the Sun, or about one-fifth of the way to
the nearest star. These orbits extend far beyond the Kuiper belt.
Furthermore, intermediate-period and long-period comets have
orbital planes that are often steeply inclined to the plane of the
ecliptic. (Comet Halley’s orbital plane is inclined by 162° to the
ecliptic, which means that it orbits the Sun in the opposite direction to the planets.)
The best explanation for these observations is that intermediateperiod and long-period comets come from a reservoir that extends
from the Kuiper belt to some 50,000 AU from the Sun. This reservoir, first hypothesized by Dutch astronomer Jan Oort in 1950
and now called the Oort cloud, does not lie in or near the
ecliptic; rather, it is a spherical distribution centered on the Sun
(Figure 15-27). This explains why many intermediate-period and
long-period comets have steeply inclined orbits.
Because astronomers discover long-period comets at the rate
of about one per month, it is reasonable to suppose that there is
an enormous population of comets in the Oort cloud. Estimates
of the number of “dirty snowballs” in the Oort cloud range as
high as 5 trillion (5 ⫻ 1012). Only such a large reservoir of comet
nuclei would explain why we see so many long-period comets,
even though each one takes several million years to travel once
around its orbit. Because the Oort cloud is so distant, it has not
yet been possible to detect objects in the Oort cloud directly.
The Oort cloud was probably created 4.56 billion years ago
from numerous icy planetesimals that orbited the Sun in the vicin-

somewhat different times at different distances from the center of
the solar nebula before being catapulted into the Oort cloud. This
variety of ages is one reason why comets are of particular interest to planetary scientists: Comets carry information about the

One remarkable comet, called Shoemaker-Levy 9,
broke apart for a different reason. As the comet swung
by Jupiter in July 1992, the giant planet’s tidal forces
tore the nucleus into more than 20 fragments. Jupiter’s gravity
then deflected the trajectories of these fragments so that they
plummeted into the planet’s atmosphere.
As a comet’s nucleus evaporates, residual dust and rock fragments form a meteoritic swarm, a loose collection of debris that
continues to circle the Sun along the comet’s orbit (Figure 15-30).
If the Earth’s orbit happens to pass through this swarm, a meteor
shower is seen as the dust particles strike the Earth’s upper
atmosphere.
.17

The Fragmentation of Comet LINEAR The Lincoln Near Earth Asteroid
Research (LINEAR) project discovered this comet in 1999. As it passed the
perihelion of its orbit in July 2000, Comet LINEAR broke into more than a
dozen small fragments. These continue to orbit the Sun along the same
trajectory that the comet followed prior to its breakup. This image was
made using the Very Large Telescope (see Figure 6-18). (European

Figure 15-29

Because they evaporate away part of their mass each time they
pass near the Sun, comets cannot last
forever. A typical comet may lose Comets eventually break
about 0.5% to 1% of its ice each
apart, and their
time it passes near the Sun. Hence,
the ice completely vaporizes after fragments give rise to
about 100 or 200 perihelion pas- meteor showers

and pebbles. Astronomers have observed some comet nuclei in the
process of fragmenting (Figure 15-29).

*The date of maximum intensity is the best time to observe a particular shower, although good
displays can often be seen a day or two before or after the maximum. The typical hourly rate is
given for an observer under optimum viewing conditions. The average speed refers to how fast the
meteoroids are moving when they strike the atmosphere.

Nearly a dozen meteor showers can be seen each year (Table
15-1). Note that the radiants for these showers—that is, the places
among the stars from which the meteors appear to come—are not
confined to the constellations of the zodiac. This means that the
swarms do not all orbit in the plane of the ecliptic. The reason is
that the orbits of their parent comets were inclined at random angles to the plane of the ecliptic (see Figure 15-30).

Key Ideas
Discovery of the Asteroids: Astronomers first discovered the asteroids while searching for a “missing planet.”
• Thousands of asteroids with diameters ranging from a few kilometers up to 1000 kilometers orbit within the asteroid belt between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.
Origin of the Asteroids: The asteroids are the relics of planetesimals that failed to accrete into a full-sized planet, thanks to the
effects of Jupiter and other Mars-sized objects.
• Even today, gravitational perturbations by Jupiter deplete certain orbits within the asteroid belt. The resulting gaps, called
Kirkwood gaps, occur at simple fractions of Jupiter’s orbital
period.
• Jupiter’s gravity also captures asteroids in two locations, called
Lagrangian points, along Jupiter’s orbit.
Asteroid Collisions: Asteroids undergo collisions with each other,
causing them to break up into smaller fragments.
• Some asteroids, called near-Earth objects, move in elliptical orbits that cross the orbits of Mars and Earth. If such an asteroid
strikes the Earth, it forms an impact crater whose diameter depends on both the mass and the speed of the asteroid.
• An asteroid struck the Earth 65 million years ago, possibly
causing the extinction of the dinosaurs and many other species.
Meteoroids, Meteors, and Meteorites: Small rocks in space are
called meteoroids. If a meteoroid enters the Earth’s atmosphere,
it produces a fiery trail called a meteor. If part of the object sur-

Vagabonds of the Solar System

vives the fall, the fragment that reaches the Earth’s surface is
called a meteorite.
• Meteorites are grouped into three major classes, according to
composition: iron, stony iron, and stony meteorites. Irons and
stony irons are fragments of the core of an asteroid that was large
enough and hot enough to have undergone chemical differentiation, just like a terrestrial planet. Some stony meteorites come
from the crust of such differentiated meteorites, while others are
fragments of small asteroids that never underwent differentiation.

8.

9.
10.

• Rare stony meteorites called carbonaceous chondrites may be
relatively unmodified material from the solar nebula. These meteorites often contain organic material and may have played a
role in the origin of life on Earth.

11.

• Analysis of isotopes in certain meteorites suggests that a nearby
supernova may have triggered the formation of the solar system
4.56 billion years ago.

12.

Comets: A comet is a chunk of ice with imbedded rock fragments
that generally moves in a highly elliptical orbit about the Sun.

14.

• As a comet approaches the Sun, its icy nucleus develops a luminous coma, surrounded by a vast hydrogen envelope. An ion tail
and a dust tail extend from the comet, pushed away from the Sun
by the solar wind and radiation pressure, respectively.

15.

13.

16.

Origin and Fate of Comets: Comets are thought to originate from
two regions, the Kuiper belt and the Oort cloud.

17.

• The Kuiper belt lies in the plane of the ecliptic at distances between 30 and 50 AU from the Sun. It is thought to contain many
tens of thousands of comet nuclei. Many Jupiter-family comets
probably come from the Kuiper belt, and hundreds of larger objects have been observed in the Kuiper belt.

18.
19.

• The Oort cloud contains billions of comet nuclei in a spherical distribution that extends out to 50,000 AU from the Sun.
Intermediate-period and long-period comets are thought to originate in the Oort cloud. As yet no objects in the Oort cloud have
been detected directly.

20.

• Fragments of “burned out” comets produce meteoritic swarms.
A meteor shower is seen when the Earth passes through a meteoritic swarm.

who lived on the slopes of Mount Ida.) Describe a scenario

Dactyl’s surface, could you throw a baseball straight up so
that it would never come down? Professional baseball pitchers

your throwing speed is probably a bit less.

Meteors: Informative details concerning upcoming
meteor showers appear on the Web sites for Sky
& Telescope and Astronomy magazines.
Comets: Because astronomers discover dozens of comets
each year, there is usually a comet visible somewhere in the
sky. Unfortunately, they are often quite dim, and you will
need to have access to a moderately large telescope (at least
35 cm, or 14 in.). You can get up-to-date information from
the Minor Planet Center Web site. Also, if there is an especially bright comet in the sky, useful information about it
might be found at the Web sites for Sky & Telescope and Astronomy magazines.
Asteroids: At opposition, some of the largest asteroids are
bright enough to be seen through a modest telescope. Check
the Minor Planet Center Web site to see if any bright asteroids are near opposition. If so, check the current issue as well
as the most recent January issue of Sky & Telescope magazine for a star chart showing the asteroid’s path among the
constellations. You will need such a chart to distinguish the
asteroid from background stars. Also, you can locate Ceres,
Pallas, Juno, and Vesta using the Starry Night Enthusiast™

advantages of this scheme? What are the disadvantages?
47. From the abundance of craters on the Moon and Mercury,
we know that numerous asteroids and meteoroids struck the
inner planets early in the history of our solar system. Is it reasonable to suppose that numerous comets also pelted the
planets 3.5 to 4.5 billion years ago? Speculate about the effects of such a cometary bombardment, especially with regard to the evolution of the primordial atmospheres on the
terrestrial planets.
48. In the 1998 movie Armageddon, an asteroid “the size of

Pluto and the Kuiper Belt
by Scott Sheppard
he “what is a planet” controversy began with the discovery of Ceres and several other objects between Mars and
Jupiter in the early 1800s. At first, Ceres and then Pallas, Juno, and Vesta were considered planets, even though they
were orders of magnitude less massive than the other known
planets and all had similar orbits. The definition of a planet at
this time was simple. Any object in orbit about the Sun that
did not show cometary effects was a planet.
By the mid 1800s, the discovery of more and more objects
between Mars and Jupiter saw the words “asteroid” and “minor planet” start to be used in order to signify these objects as
an ensemble of bodies. That is, astronomers felt a major planet
should be a rare and unique thing. The major planet club thus
was left with eight members: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars,
Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.
The planet controversy arose once again in 1930 with the
discovery of Pluto, where it was quickly regarded as the ninth
planet. During the ensuing years, new observations downgraded Pluto’s size from being near that of Earth to being
smaller than our Moon. Its orbit also proved to be peculiar because it was highly inclined and eccentric, having it even crossing Neptune’s orbit. Its uniqueness kept Pluto in the planet
club with relatively few detractors until 1992, when the first
Kuiper belt object was discovered. As it became apparent that
hundreds of thousands of Kuiper belt objects existed on stable
orbits just beyond Neptune, Pluto’s planet status was becoming less and less certain. With the discovery of Eris (2003
UB313) in 2003, an object larger than Pluto, Pluto’s last unique
claim of being the largest Kuiper belt object was lost. Thus, the
planet controversy had finally reached a point where a major
planet’s minimum size must be precisely defined.
No matter how you count them, there are no longer nine
major planets in our solar system. The same situation of the
main belt asteroids in the mid 1800’s is now apparent with

T

Scott S. Sheppard is an astronomer at the Carnegie
Institution of Washington in the Department of
Terrestrial Magnetism located in Washington, D.C. His
main research currently involves discovering small bodies in our
solar system to understand their dynamical and physical properties
that help constrain solar system and planet formation. He has
discovered several small moons around all the giant planets, been
a pioneer in the discovery of Neptune Trojans, as well as found
tens of Kuiper Belt objects.

Pluto, Eris, and the rest of the Kuiper belt objects. Although
the largest Kuiper belt objects are significantly bigger than the
largest main belt asteroids, they are still an ensemble of bodies with a continuous size distribution and similar formation
and evolution histories. The reason Pluto’s status as a planet
is a controversy now is simply because it took 62 years between the discovery of Pluto and the next Kuiper belt object in
1992. Within that time span Pluto became known as the ninth
planet through several generations and was ingrained in society as such.
Classification is not that important to scientists but it is
the understanding of how the object formed and its history.
Even so, any classification should have a scientific base and
not be based on tradition, as seems to be the case for Pluto in
the recent past. Eris as well as Pluto and the rest of the Kuiper
belt objects had very similar histories and formation scenarios
and thus they should be considered as an ensemble of objects
just like the main belt asteroids between Mars and Jupiter. As
technology advances, our knowledge and thus understanding
advances and so should our classification.
Several minimum-size planet definitions were debated recently. The first is that anything larger than a certain minimum
size is a planet. The chosen size would likely be arbitrary and
may be a nice round number like 1000 km or the size of Pluto.
This stems from the traditional belief that Pluto has been considered a planet in the past and should continue as such. This
would give us ten current planets including Eris. A second possible definition is that anything that is spherical should be a
planet. This definition is based on physics in which the gravitational force of an object is large enough to overcome any
other forces in determining the overall shape of the object. Determining if an object meets this criteria or not is complicated.
This definition would also significantly change the status quo
by increasing the number of known planets by several factors
overnight. A third definition is that any object with a unique
orbit and gravitationally dominates its local orbital environment should be a planet. This definition is the most scientifically based, in that objects with similar formation and
evolutionary histories would be grouped together. Using this
definition would give us eight known major planets, dropping
Pluto from the list.
A final proposal as to what is a planet takes into account
that the current known major planets themselves are remarkably
different and can be split into individual categories themselves.

Pluto and the Kuiper Belt (continued)
Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars are terrestrial planets whose
compositions are dominated by rock. Jupiter and Saturn are
gas giant planets dominated by their hydrogen and helium envelopes. Uranus and Neptune are ice giant planets dominated
by gases other than hydrogen and helium. The trans-Neptunian
objects or “ice dwarf planets,” as some are calling them, are
probably composed of large amounts of volatiles such as
methane ice and water ice.
The International Astronomical Union (IAU) recently
choose to use a combination of the second and third definitions above to define a planet. That is, a planet is an object
that is both spherical and has a unique orbit in which it is
gravitationally dominant. An object that only satisfies definition two above and not three is now being called a dwarf

planet, of which Ceres, Pluto and Eris qualify, as well as several more objects in the Kuiper belt. In reality, it’s the public
that must accept this definition, and we will only know if that
is the case a few generations from now.
Defining the word “planet” is like defining what an ocean
is. At first it appears to be a simple term, but is very hard to
precisely define. Further planet discoveries will be made and
there are sure to be borderline cases. This is just the way nature is; it does not have little bins to nicely classify objects, but
there is usually a continuous array of objects. The important
thing to take away from all of this is to understand this array
of objects by using our rapidly expanding scientific knowledge
and understanding our place in the solar system.

Our Star,
the Sun

he Sun is by far the brightest object in the sky. By earthly
standards, the temperature of its glowing surface is remarkably high, about 5800 K. Yet there are regions of the Sun
that reach far higher temperatures of tens of thousands or even
millions of kelvins. Gases at such temperatures emit ultraviolet
light, which makes them prominent in the accompanying image
from an ultraviolet telescope in space. Some of the hottest and
most energetic regions on the Sun spawn immense disturbances.
These can propel solar material across space to reach the Earth
and other planets.
In recent decades, we have learned that the Sun shines because at its core hundreds of millions of tons of hydrogen are converted to helium every second. We have confirmed this picture by
detecting the by-products of this transmutation—strange, ethereal
particles called neutrinos—streaming outward from the Sun into
space. We have discovered that the Sun has a surprisingly violent
atmosphere, with a host of features such as sunspots whose numbers rise and fall on a predictable 11-year cycle. By studying the
Sun’s vibrations, we have begun to probe beneath its surface into
hitherto unexplored realms. And we have just begun to investigate how changes in the Sun’s activity can affect the Earth’s environment as well as our technological society.

Solar Energy
For most people, what matters most about the Sun is the energy
that it radiates into space. Without the Sun’s warming rays, our
atmosphere and oceans would freeze into an icy layer coating a
desperately cold planet, and life on Earth would be impossible.
To understand why we are here, we must understand the nature
of the Sun.
Why is the Sun such an important source of energy? An important part of the answer is that the Sun has a far higher surface
temperature than any of the planets or moons. The Sun’s spectrum is close to that of an idealized blackbody with a temperature of 5800 K (see Sections 5-3 and 5-4, especially Figure 5-12).
Thanks to this high temperature, each square meter of the Sun’s
surface emits a tremendous amount of radiation, principally at
visible wavelengths. Indeed, the Sun is the only object in the solar system that emits substantial amounts of visible light. The
light that we see from the Moon and planets is actually sunlight
that struck those worlds and was reflected toward Earth.
The Sun’s size also helps us explain its tremendous energy
output. Because the Sun is so large, the total number of square

meters of radiating surface—that is, its surface area—is immense.
Hence, the total amount of energy emitted by the Sun each second, called its luminosity, is very large indeed: about 3.9 ⫻ 1026
watts, or 3.9 ⫻ 1026 joules of energy emitted per second. (We discussed the relation among the Sun’s surface temperature, radius,
and luminosity in Box 5-2.) Astronomers denote the Sun’s luminosity by the symbol L䉺. (A circle with a dot in the center is the
astronomical symbol for the Sun and was also used by ancient
astrologers.)

The Source of the Sun’s Energy: Early Ideas
These ideas lead us to a more fundamental question: What keeps
the Sun’s visible surface so hot? Or, put another way, what is the
fundamental source of the tremendous energies that the Sun radiates into space? For centuries, this was one of the greatest mysteries in science. The mystery deepened in the nineteenth century,
when geologists and biologists found convincing evidence that life
had existed on Earth for at least several hundred million years.
(We now know that the Earth is 4.56 billion years old and that
life has existed on it for most of its history.) Since life as we know

The Sun The Sun’s visible surface has a temperature of about 5800 K. At
this temperature, all solids and liquids vaporize to form gases. It was only
in the twentieth century that scientists discovered what has kept the Sun
so hot for billions of years: the thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen nuclei in
the Sun’s core. (Jeremy Woodhouse/PhotoDisc)

it depends crucially on sunlight, the Sun must be as old. This
posed a severe problem for physicists. What source of energy
could have kept the Sun shining for so long (Figure 16-1)?
One attempt to explain solar energy was made in the mid1800s by the English physicist Lord Kelvin (for whom the temperature scale is named) and the German scientist Hermann von
Helmholtz. They argued that the tremendous weight of the Sun’s
outer layers should cause the Sun to contract gradually, compressing its interior gases. Whenever a gas is compressed, its temperature rises. (You can demonstrate this with a bicycle pump: As you
pump air into a tire, the temperature of the air increases and the
pump becomes warm to the touch.) Kelvin and Helmholtz thus
suggested that gravitational contraction could cause the Sun’s
gases to become hot enough to radiate energy out into space.
This process, called Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction, actually
does occur during the earliest stages of the birth of a star like the
Sun (see Section 8-4). But Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction cannot
be the major source of the Sun’s energy today. If it were, the Sun
would have had to be much larger in the relatively recent past.
Helmholtz’s own calculations showed that the Sun could have
started its initial collapse from the solar nebula no more than
about 25 million years ago. But the geological and fossil record
shows that the Earth is far older than that, and so the Sun must
be as well. Hence, this model of a Sun that shines because it
shrinks cannot be correct.
On Earth, a common way to produce heat and light is by
burning fuel, such as a log in a fireplace or coal in a power plant.
Is it possible that a similar process explains the energy released by
the Sun? The answer is no, because this process could not continue for a long enough time to explain the age of the Earth. The
chemical reactions involved in burning release roughly 10⫺19
joule of energy per atom. Therefore, the number of atoms that
would have to undergo chemical reactions each second to gener-

There are about 3 ⫻ 107 seconds in a year. Hence, in this
model, the Sun would burn itself out in a mere 10,000 (104)
years! This is far shorter than the known age of the Earth, so
chemical reactions also cannot explain how the Sun shines.

The Source of the Sun’s Energy:
Discovering Thermonuclear Fusion
The source of the Sun’s luminosity could be explained if there
were a process that was like burning but released much more energy per atom. Then the rate at which atoms would have to be
consumed would be far less, and the lifetime of the Sun could be
long enough to be consistent with the known age of the Earth.
Albert Einstein discovered the key to such a process in 1905. According to his special theory of relativity, a quantity m of mass
can in principle be converted into an amount of energy E according to a now-famous equation:
Einstein’s mass-energy equation
E ⫽ mc2
m ⫽ quantity of mass, in kg
c ⫽ speed of light ⫽ 3 ⫻ 108 m/s
E ⫽ amount of energy into which the mass can be
converted, in joules
The speed of light c is a large number, so c2 is huge. Therefore, a small amount of matter can release an awesome amount
of energy.
Inspired by Einstein’s ideas, astronomers began to wonder if
the Sun’s energy output might come from the conversion of matter into energy. The Sun’s low density of 1410 kg/m3 indicates
that it must be made of the very lightest atoms, primarily hydrogen and helium. In the 1920s, the British astronomer Arthur Eddington showed that temperatures near the center of the Sun must
be so high that atoms become completely ionized. Hence, at the
Sun’s center we expect to find hydrogen nuclei and electrons flying around independent of each other.
Another British astronomer,
Robert Atkinson, suggested that un- Ideas from relativity and

Converting Mass into Energy
he Cosmic Connections figure shows the steps involved in
the thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen at the Sun’s center.
T
In these steps, four protons are converted into a single nucleus
of 4He, an isotope of helium with two protons and two neutrons. (As we saw in Box 5-5, different isotopes of the same element have the same number of protons but different numbers
of neutrons.) The reaction depicted in Figure 16-2a also produces a neutral, nearly massless particle called the neutrino.
Neutrinos respond hardly at all to ordinary matter, so they
travel almost unimpeded through the Sun’s massive bulk.
Hence, the energy that neutrinos carry is quickly lost into
space. This loss is not great, however, because the neutrinos
carry relatively little energy. (See Section 16-4 for more about
these curious particles.)
Most of the energy released by thermonuclear fusion appears in the form of gamma-ray photons. The energy of these
photons remains trapped within the Sun for a long time, thus
maintaining the Sun’s intense internal heat. Some gamma-ray
photons are produced by the reaction shown as Step 2 in the
Cosmic Connections figure. Others appear when an electron in
the Sun’s interior annihilates a positively charged electron, or
positron, which is a by-product of the reaction shown in Step
1 in the Cosmic Connections figure. An electron and a positron
are respectively matter and antimatter, and they convert entirely into energy when they meet. (You may have thought that
“antimatter” was pure science fiction. In fact, tremendous
amounts of antimatter are being created and annihilated in the
Sun as you read these words.)
We can summarize the thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen
as follows:
4 1H 씮 4He ⫹ neutrinos ⫹ gamma-ray photons
To calculate how much energy is released in this process,
we use Einstein’s mass-energy formula: The energy released is
equal to the amount of mass consumed multiplied by c2, where
c is the speed of light. To see how much mass is consumed, we
compare the combined mass of four hydrogen atoms (the ingredients) to the mass of one helium atom (the product):

Mass lost ⫽ 0.048 ⫻ 10⫺27 kg

into a large amount of energy. Experiments in the laboratory using individual nuclei show that such reactions can indeed take
place. The process of converting hydrogen into helium is called
hydrogen fusion. (It is also sometimes called hydrogen burning,
even though nothing is actually burned in the conventional sense.
Ordinary burning involves chemical reactions that rearrange the

Thus, a small fraction (0.7%) of the mass of the hydrogen
going into the nuclear reaction does not show up in the mass
of the helium. This lost mass is converted into an amount of
energy E ⫽ mc2:
E ⫽ mc2 ⫽ (0.048 ⫻ 10–27 kg)(3 ⫻ 108 m/s)2
⫽ 4.3 ⫻ 10⫺12 joule
This is the amount of energy released by the formation of
a single helium atom. It would light a 10-watt lightbulb for almost one-half of a trillionth of a second.

EXAMPLE: How much energy is released when 1 kg of
hydrogen is converted to helium?

Situation: We are given the initial mass of hydrogen. We
know that a fraction of the mass is lost when the hydrogen
undergoes fusion to make helium; our goal is to find the
quantity of energy into which this lost mass is transformed.

Tools: We use the equation E ⫽ mc2 and the result that 0.7%
of the mass is lost when hydrogen is converted into
hydrogen.

Answer: When 1 kilogram of hydrogen is converted to
helium, the amount of mass lost is 0.7% of 1 kg, or 0.007
kg. (This means that 0.993 kg of helium is produced.) Using
Einstein’s equation, we find that this missing 0.007 kg of
matter is transformed into an amount of energy equal to
E ⫽ mc2 ⫽ (0.007 kg)(3 ⫻ 108 m/s)2 ⫽ 6.3 ⫻ 1014 joules

Review: The energy released by the fusion of 1 kilogram of
hydrogen is the same as that released by burning 20,000
metric tons (2 ⫻ 107 kg) of coal! Hydrogen fusion is a much
more efficient energy source than ordinary burning.
The Sun’s luminosity is 3.9 ⫻ 1026 joules per second. To

outer electrons of atoms but have no effect on the atoms’ nuclei.)
Hydrogen fusion provides the devastating energy released in a hydrogen bomb (see Figure 1-4).
The fusing together of nuclei is also called thermonuclear fusion, because it can take place only at extremely high temperatures. The reason is that all nuclei have a positive electric charge

The most common form of hydrogen fusion in the Sun involves
three steps, each of which releases energy.

Hydrogen fusion in the Sun
usually takes place in a
sequence of steps called the
proton-proton chain. Each of
these steps releases energy
that heats the Sun and gives
it its luminosity.

and so tend to repel one another. But in the extreme heat and
pressure at the Sun’s center, hydrogen nuclei (protons) are moving so fast that they can overcome their electric repulsion and actually touch one another. When that happens, thermonuclear
fusion can take place.

ANALOGY You can think of protons as tiny electrically charged

CAUTION! Be careful not to confuse thermonuclear fusion
with the similar-sounding process of nuclear fission. In nuclear
fusion, energy is released by joining together nuclei of lightweight atoms such as hydrogen. In nuclear fission, by contrast,
the nuclei of very massive atoms such as uranium or plutonium
release energy by fragmenting into smaller nuclei. Nuclear power
plants produce energy using fission, not fusion. (Generating
power using fusion has been a goal of researchers for decades,
but no one has yet devised a commercially viable way to do
this.)

Converting Hydrogen to Helium
We learned in Section 5-8 that the nucleus of a hydrogen atom
(H) consists of a single proton. The nucleus of a helium atom (He)
consists of two protons and two neutrons. In the nuclear process
that Atkinson described, four hydrogen nuclei combine to form
one helium nucleus, with a concurrent release of energy:
4 H 씮 He ⫹ energy
In several separate reactions, two of the four protons are
changed into neutrons, and eventually combine with the remaining protons to produce a helium nucleus. This sequence of reactions is called the proton-proton chain. The Cosmic Connections
figure depicts the proton-proton chain in detail.
Each time this process takes place, a small fraction (0.7%) of
the combined mass of the hydrogen nuclei does not show up in
the mass of the helium nucleus. This “lost” mass is converted into
energy. Box 16-1 describes how to use Einstein’s mass-energy
equation to calculate the amount of energy released.

CAUTION! You may have heard the idea that mass is always
conserved (that is, it is neither created nor destroyed), or that
energy is always conserved in a reaction. Einstein’s ideas show
that neither of these statements is quite correct, because mass
can be converted into energy and vice versa. A more accurate
statement is that the total amount of mass plus energy is conserved. Hence, the destruction of mass in the Sun does not violate any laws of nature.
For every four hydrogen nuclei converted into a helium nucleus, 4.3 ⫻ 10⫺12 joule of energy is released. This may seem like
only a tiny amount of energy, but it is about 107 times larger than
the amount of energy released in a typical chemical reaction, such
as occurs in ordinary burning. Thus, thermonuclear fusion can
explain how the Sun could have been shining for billions of years.

The proton-proton chain is also the energy source for
many of the stars in the sky. In stars with central temperatures that are much hotter than that of the Sun,
however, hydrogen fusion proceeds according to a different set of
nuclear reactions, called the CNO cycle, in which carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen nuclei absorb protons to produce helium nuclei.
Still other thermonuclear reactions, such as helium fusion, carbon
fusion, and oxygen fusion, occur late in the lives of many stars.

spheres that are coated with a very powerful glue. If the spheres
are not touching, the repulsion between their charges pushes
them apart. But if the spheres are forced into contact, the strength
of the glue “fuses” them together.

To produce the Sun’s luminosity of 3.9 ⫻ 1026 joules per second, 6 ⫻ 1011 kg (600 million metric tons) of hydrogen must be
converted into helium each second. This rate is prodigious, but
there is a literally astronomical amount of hydrogen in the Sun.
In particular, the Sun’s core contains enough hydrogen to have
been giving off energy at the present rate for as long as the solar
system has existed, about 4.56 billion years, and to continue doing so for more than 6 billion years into the future.

16-2 A theoretical model of the Sun shows
how energy gets from its center to its surface
While thermonuclear fusion is the source of the Sun’s energy, this
process cannot take place everywhere within the Sun. As we have
seen, extremely high temperatures—in excess of 107 K—are required for atomic nuclei to fuse together to form larger nuclei.
The temperature of the Sun’s visible surface, about 5800 K, is too
low for these reactions to occur there. Hence, thermonuclear fusion can be taking place only within the Sun’s interior. But precisely where does it take place? And how does the energy produced
by fusion make its way to the surface, where it is emitted into
space in the form of photons?
To answer these questions, we must understand conditions in
the Sun’s interior. Ideally, we would send an exploratory spacecraft to probe deep into the Sun; in practice, the Sun’s intense heat
would vaporize even the sturdiest spacecraft. Instead, astronomers
use the laws of physics to construct a theoretical model of the
Sun. (We discussed the use of models in science in Section 1-1.)
Let’s see what ingredients go into building a model of this kind.

Hydrostatic Equilibrium
Note first that the Sun is not undergoing any dramatic changes.
The Sun is not exploding or collapsing, nor is it significantly heating or cooling. The Sun is thus said to be in both hydrostatic equilibrium and thermal equilibrium.
To understand what is meant by hydrostatic equilibrium,
imagine a slab of material in the solar interior (Figure 16-2a). In
equilibrium, the slab on average will move neither up nor down.
(In fact, there are upward and downward motions of material inside the Sun, but these motions average out.) Equilibrium is maintained by a balance among three forces that act on this slab:
1. The downward pressure of the layers of solar material above
the slab.
2. The upward pressure of the hot gases beneath the slab.
3. The slab’s weight—that is, the downward gravitational pull
it feels from the rest of the Sun.

level.)

Another consideration is that the Sun’s interior is so hot that it is
completely gaseous. Gases compress and become more dense
when you apply greater pressure to them, so density must increase
along with pressure as you go to greater depths within the Sun.
Furthermore, when you compress a gas, its temperature tends to
rise, so the temperature must also increase as you move toward
the Sun’s center.
While the temperature in the solar interior is different at different depths, the temperature at each depth remains constant in
time. This principle is called thermal equilibrium. For the Sun to
be in thermal equilibrium, all the energy generated by thermonuclear reactions in the Sun’s core must be transported to the Sun’s
glowing surface, where it can be radiated into space. If too much
energy flowed from the core to the surface to be radiated away,
the Sun’s interior would cool down; alternatively, the Sun’s interior would heat up if too little energy flowed to the surface.

Weight of the fish

(b) A fish floating in water is in hydrostatic equilibrium, so forces balance

Figure 16-2
Hydrostatic Equilibrium (a) Material in the Sun’s interior tends to move
neither up nor down. The upward forces on a slab of solar material (due to
pressure of gases below the slab) must balance the downward forces
(due to the slab’s weight and the pressure of gases above the slab).
Hence, the pressure must increase with increasing depth. (b) The same
principle applies to a fish floating in water. In equilibrium, the forces
balance and the fish neither rises nor sinks. (Ken Usami/PhotoDisc)

The pressure from below must balance both the slab’s weight
and the pressure from above. Hence, the pressure below the slab
must be greater than that above the slab. In other words, pressure has to increase with increasing depth. For the same reason,
pressure increases as you dive deeper into the ocean (Figure
16-2b) or as you move toward lower altitudes in our atmosphere.
Hydrostatic equilibrium also tells us about the density of the
slab. If the slab is too dense, its weight will be too great and it
will sink; if the density is too low, the slab will rise. To prevent
this, the density of solar material must have a certain value at
each depth within the solar interior. (The same principle applies
to objects that float beneath the surface of the ocean. Scuba divers

But exactly how is energy transported from the Sun’s center to its
surface? There are three methods of energy transport: conduction,
convection, and radiative diffusion. Only the last two are important inside the Sun.
If you heat one end of a metal bar with a blowtorch, energy
flows to the other end of the bar so that it too becomes warm.
The efficiency of this method of energy transport, called conduction, varies significantly from one substance to another. For example, copper is a good conductor of heat, but wood is not
(which is why copper pots often have wooden handles). Conduction is not an efficient means of energy transport in substances
with low average densities, including the gases inside stars like
the Sun.
Inside stars like our Sun, energy moves from center to surface
by two other means: convection and radiative diffusion. Convection is the circulation of fluids—gases or liquids—between hot
and cool regions. Hot gases rise toward a star’s surface, while
cool gases sink back down toward the star’s center. This physical
movement of gases transports heat energy outward in a star, just
as the physical movement of water boiling in a pot transports energy from the bottom of the pot (where the heat is applied) to the
cooler water at the surface.
In radiative diffusion, photons created in the thermonuclear
inferno at a star’s center diffuse outward toward the star’s surface. Individual photons are absorbed and reemitted by atoms
and electrons inside the star. The overall result is an outward migration from the hot core, where photons are constantly created,
toward the cooler surface, where they escape into space.

Modeling the Sun
To construct a model of a star like the Sun, astrophysicists express the ideas of hydrostatic equilibrium, thermal equilibrium,
and energy transport as a set of equations. To ensure that the
model applies to the particular star under study, they also make

0.0 is at the center of the Sun and 1.0 is at the surface. The fraction of luminosity is that portion of
the Sun’s total luminosity produced within each distance from the center; this is equal to 1.00 for

We have described how astrophysicists construct models of the Sun. But since we cannot see into the Sun’s
opaque interior, how can we check these models to see
if they are accurate? What is needed is a technique for probing
the Sun’s interior. A very powerful technique of just this kind involves measuring vibrations of the Sun as a whole. This field of
solar research is called helioseismology.
Vibrations are a useful tool for examining the hidden interiors of all kinds of objects. Food shoppers test whether melons are
ripe by tapping on them and listening to the vibrations. Geologists can determine the structure of the Earth’s interior by using
seismographs to record vibrations during earthquakes.
Although there are no true “sunquakes,” the Sun does vibrate
at a variety of frequencies, somewhat like a ringing bell. These vibrations were first noticed in 1960 by Robert Leighton of the California Institute of Technology, who made high-precision Doppler
shift observations of the solar surface. These measurements revealed that parts of the Sun’s surface move up and down about
10 meters every 5 minutes. Since the mid-1970s, several astronomers have reported slower vibrations, having periods ranging from 20 to 160 minutes. The detection of extremely slow
vibrations has inspired astronomers to organize networks of telescopes around and in orbit above the Earth to monitor the Sun’s
vibrations on a continuous basis.

The Sun’s Internal Structure Thermonuclear reactions occur in the
Sun’s core, which extends out to a distance of 0.25 R䉺 from the center.
Energy is transported outward, via radiative diffusion, to a distance of
about 0.71 R䉺. In the outer layers between 0.71 R䉺 and 1.00 R䉺, energy
flows outward by convection.

and this absorption chokes off the outward flow of photons.
Therefore, beyond about 0.71 R䉺, radiative diffusion is not an effective way to transport energy. Instead, convection dominates
the energy flow in this outer region, which is why it is called the
convective zone. Figure 16-4 shows these aspects of the Sun’s internal structure.
Although energy travels through the radiative zone in the
form of photons, the photons have a difficult time of it. Table
16-2 shows that the material in this zone is extremely dense, so
photons from the Sun’s core take a long time to diffuse through
the radiative zone. As a result, it takes approximately 170,000
years for energy created at the Sun’s center to travel 696,000 km
to the solar surface and finally escape as sunlight. The energy
flows outward at an average rate of 50 centimeters per hour, or
about 20 times slower than a snail’s pace.
Once the energy escapes from the Sun, it travels much faster—
at the speed of light. Thus, solar energy that reaches you today
took only 8 minutes to travel the
150 million kilometers from the The sunlight that reaches
Sun’s surface to the Earth. But this Earth today results from

tially the same results as those shown here. From such computer
models we have learned that at the Sun’s center the density is
160,000 kg/m3 (14 times the density of lead!), the temperature is
1.55 ⫻ 107 K, and the pressure is 3.4 ⫻ 1011 atm. (One atmosphere, or 1 atm, is the average atmospheric pressure at sea level
on Earth.)
Table 16-2 and Figure 16-3 show that the solar luminosity
rises to 100% at about one-quarter of the way from the Sun’s
center to its surface. In other words, the Sun’s energy production
occurs within a volume that extends out only to 0.25 R䉺. (The
symbol R䉺 denotes the solar radius, or radius of the Sun as a
whole, equal to 696,000 km.) Outside 0.25 R䉺, the density and
temperature are too low for thermonuclear reactions to take place.
Also note that 94% of the total mass of the Sun is found within
the inner 0.5 R䉺. Hence, the outer 0.5 R䉺 contains only a relatively small amount of material.
How energy flows from the Sun’s center toward its surface
depends on how easily photons move through the gas. If the solar gases are comparatively transparent, photons can travel moderate distances before being scattered or absorbed, and energy is
thus transported by radiative diffusion. If the gases are comparatively opaque, photons cannot get through the gas easily and heat
builds up. Convection then becomes the most efficient means of
energy transport. The gases start to churn, with hot gas moving
upward and cooler gas sinking downward.
From the center of the Sun out to about 0.71 R䉺, energy is
transported by radiative diffusion. Hence, this region is called the
radiative zone. Beyond about 0.71 R䉺, the temperature is low
enough (a mere 2 ⫻ 106 K or so) for electrons and hydrogen nuclei to join into hydrogen atoms. These atoms are very effective
at absorbing photons, much more so than free electrons or nuclei,

turbulence in the Sun’s gases. But superimposed on this noise
would be a variety of nearly pure tones. You would need greatly
enhanced hearing to detect these tones, however; the strongest has
a frequency of just 0.003 hertz, 13 octaves below the lowest frequency audible to humans. (Recall from Section 5-2 that one
hertz is one oscillation per second.)
In 1970, Roger Ulrich, at UCLA, pointed out that sound
waves moving upward from the solar interior would be reflected
back inward after reaching the solar surface. However, as a reflected sound wave descends back into the Sun, the increasing
density and pressure bend the wave severely, turning it around
and aiming it back toward the solar surface. In other words,
sound waves bounce back and forth between the solar surface
and layers deep within the Sun. These sound waves can reinforce
each other if their wavelength is the right size, just as sound waves
of a particular wavelength resonate inside an organ pipe.
The Sun oscillates in millions of ways as a result of waves resonating in its interior. Figure 16-5 is a computer-generated illustration of one such mode of vibration. Helioseismologists can de- The Sun’s oscillations

16-4 Neutrinos reveal information about the
Sun’s core—and have surprises of their own
We have seen circumstantial evidence that thermonuclear fusion
is the source of the Sun’s power. To be certain, however, we need
more definitive evidence. How can we show that thermonuclear
fusion really is taking place in the Sun’s core?

What Sunlight Cannot Tell Us
Although the light energy that we receive from the Sun originates
in the core, it provides few clues about conditions there. The
problem is that this energy has changed form repeatedly during
its passage from the core: It appeared first as photons diffusing
through the radiative zone, then as heat transported through the
outer layers by convection, and then again as photons emitted
from the Sun’s glowing surface. As a result of these transformations, much of the information that the Sun’s radiated energy
once carried about conditions in the core has been lost.

ANALOGY If you make a photocopy of a photocopy of a photocopy of an original document, the final result may be so
blurred as to be unreadable. In an analogous way, because solar energy is transformed many times while en route to Earth,
the story it could tell us about the Sun’s core is hopelessly
blurred.
Helioseismology also cannot reveal what is happening in the
core. The vibrations that astronomers see on the Sun’s surface do
not penetrate that far into the interior.

As part of the process of hydrogen fusion, protons change
into neutrons and release neutrinos (see the Cosmic Connections
figure in Section 16-1 as well as Box 16-1). Like photons, neutrinos are particles that have no electric charge. Unlike photons,
however, neutrinos interact only very weakly with matter. Even
the vast bulk of the Sun offers little impediment to their passage,
so neutrinos must be streaming out of the core and into space. Indeed, the conversion of hydrogen into helium at the Sun’s center

neutrinos from the Sun—that is, solar neutrinos—must pass
through each square meter of the Earth.
If it were possible to detect these solar neutrinos, we would
have direct evidence that thermonuclear reactions really do take
place in the Sun’s core. Beginning in the 1960s, scientists began
to build neutrino detectors for precisely this purpose.
The challenge is that neutrinos are exceedingly difficult to detect. Just as neutrinos pass unimpeded through the Sun, they also
pass through the Earth almost as if it were not there. We stress

One key question was whether the neutrinos that Davis
had detected had really come from the Sun. (The Davis
experiment had no way to determine the direction
from which neutrinos had entered the tank of cleaning fluid.) This
was resolved by an experiment in Japan called Kamiokande,
which was designed by the physicist Masatoshi Koshiba. A large
underground tank containing 3000 tons of water was surrounded
by 1100 light detectors. From time to time, a high-energy solar
neutrino struck an electron in one of the water molecules, dislodging it and sending it flying like a pin hit by a bowling ball.
The recoiling electron produced a flash of light, which was sensed
by the detectors. By analyzing the flashes, scientists could tell the
direction from which the neutrinos were coming and confirmed
that they emanated from the Sun. These results in the late 1980s
gave direct evidence that thermonuclear fusion is indeed occurring
in the Sun’s core. (Davis and Koshiba both received the 2002 Nobel Prize in Physics for their pioneering research on solar neutrinos.)
Like Davis’s experiment, however, Koshiba and his colleagues
at Kamiokande detected only a fraction of the expected flux of
neutrinos. Where, then, were the missing solar neutrinos?

One proposed solution had to do with the energy of
the detected neutrinos. The vast majority of neutrinos
from the Sun are created during the first step in the
proton-proton chain, in which two protons combine to form a

INK 1

Only very recently has the solution to the neutrino
problem been found. The answer lies not in how neutrinos are produced, but rather in what happens to
them between the Sun’s core and detectors on the Earth. Physicists have found that there are actually three types of neutrinos.
Only one of these types is produced in the Sun, and it is only this
type that can be detected by the experiments we have described.
But if some of the solar neutrinos change in flight into a different
type of neutrino, the detectors in these experiments would record
only a fraction of the total neutrino flux. This effect is called neutrino oscillation. In June 1998, scientists at the Super-Kamiokande
neutrino observatory (a larger and more sensitive device than
Kamiokande) revealed evidence that neutrino oscillation does indeed take place.
The best confirmation of this idea has come from the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) in Canada. Like Kamiokande
and Super-Kamiokande, SNO uses a large tank of water placed
deep underground (Figure 16-6). But unlike those earlier experiments, SNO can detect all of the three types of neutrinos. It does
this by using heavy water. In ordinary, or “light,” water, each hydrogen atom in the H2O molecule has a solitary proton as its nucleus. In heavy water, by contrast, each of the hydrogen nuclei
has a nucleus made up of a proton and a neutron. (This is the isotope 2H shown in the Cosmic Connections figure in Section
16-1.) If a high-energy solar neutrino of any type passes through
SNO’s tank of heavy water, it can knock the neutron out of one
of the 2H nuclei. The ejected neutron can then be captured by

To test this idea, two teams of physicists constructed
neutrino detectors that used several tons of gallium (a
liquid metal) rather than cleaning fluid. Low-energy
neutrinos convert gallium (71Ga) into a radioactive isotope of germanium (71Ge). By chemically separating the germanium from the
gallium and counting the radioactive atoms, the physicists were
able to measure the flux of low-energy solar neutrinos. These
experiments—GALLEX in Italy and SAGE (Soviet-American Gallium Experiment) in Russia—detected only 50% to 60% of the
expected neutrino flux. Hence, the solar neutrino problem was a
discrepancy between theory and observation for neutrinos of all
energies.
Another proposed solution to the neutrino problem was that
the Sun’s core is cooler than predicted by solar models. If the
Sun’s central temperature were only 10% less than the current estimate, fewer neutrinos would be produced and the neutrino flux
would agree with experiments. However, a lower central temperature would cause other obvious features, such as the Sun’s size
and surface temperature, to be different from what we observe.

WE

Davis and his collaborators found that solar neutrinos created
one radioactive argon atom in the tank every three days. But this
rate corresponded to only one-third of the neutrino flux predicted
from standard models of the Sun. This troubling discrepancy between theory and observation, called the solar neutrino problem,
motivated scientists around the world to conduct further experiments to measure solar neutrinos.

heavy isotope of hydrogen (see the Cosmic Connections figure in
Section 16-1). But these neutrinos have too little energy to convert chlorine into argon. Both Davis’s and Koshiba’s experiments
responded only to high-energy neutrinos produced by reactions
that occur only part of the time near the end of the protonproton chain. (The Cosmic Connections figure in Section 16-1
does not show these reactions.) Could it be that the discrepancy
between theory and observation would go away if the flux of
low-energy neutrinos could be measured?
6.5

the word “almost,” because neutrinos can and do interact with
matter, albeit infrequently.
On rare occasions a neutrino will strike a neutron and convert it into a proton. This effect was the basis of the original solar neutrino detector, designed and built by Raymond Davis of
the Brookhaven National Laboratory in the 1960s. This device
used 100,000 gallons of perchloroethylene (C2Cl4), a fluid used
in dry cleaning, in a huge tank buried deep underground. Most
of the solar neutrinos that entered Davis’s tank passed right
through it with no effect whatsoever. But occasionally a neutrino
struck the nucleus of one of the chlorine atoms (37Cl) in the cleaning fluid and converted one of its neutrons into a proton, creating a radioactive atom of argon (37Ar).
The rate at which argon is produced is related to the neutrino
flux—that is, the number of neutrinos from the Sun arriving at
the Earth per square meter per second. By counting the number
of newly created argon atoms, Davis was able to determine the
neutrino flux from the Sun. (Other subatomic particles besides
neutrinos can also induce reactions that create radioactive atoms.
By placing the experiment deep underground, however, the body
of the Earth absorbs essentially all such particles—with the exception of neutrinos.)

another nucleus, and this capture releases energy that manifests
itself as a tiny burst of light. As in Kamiokande, detectors around
SNO’s water tank record these light flashes.
Scientists using SNO have found that the combined flux of
all three types of neutrinos coming from the Sun is equal to the
theoretical prediction. Together with the results from earlier neutrino experiments, this strongly suggests that the Sun is indeed
producing neutrinos at the predicted rate as a by-product of thermonuclear reactions. But before these neutrinos can reach the
Earth, about two-thirds of them undergo an oscillation and change
their type. Thus, there is really no solar neutrino problem—
scientists merely needed the right kind of detectors to observe all
the neutrinos, including the ones that transformed in flight.
The story of the solar neutrino problem illustrates how two
different branches of science—in this case, studies of the solar interior and investigations of subatomic particles—can sometimes
interact, to the mutual benefit of both. While there is still much
we do not understand about the Sun and about neutrinos, a new
generation of neutrino detectors in Japan, Canada, and elsewhere
promises to further our knowledge of these exotic realms of astronomy and physics.

16-5 The photosphere is the lowest of three
main layers in the Sun’s atmosphere
Although the Sun’s core is hidden from our direct view, we can
easily see sunlight coming from the high-temperature gases that
make up the Sun’s atmosphere. These outermost layers of the Sun
prove to be the sites of truly dramatic activity, much of which has
a direct impact on our planet. By studying these layers, we gain
further insight into the character of the Sun as a whole.

Observing the Photosphere
A visible-light photograph like Figure 16-7 makes it appear that
the Sun has a definite surface. This is actually an illusion; the Sun
is gaseous throughout its volume because of its high internal temperature, and the gases simply become less and less dense as you
move farther away from the Sun’s center.

Figure 16-7

RI V UXG

The Photosphere The photosphere is the layer in the solar atmosphere
from which the Sun’s visible light is emitted. Note that the Sun appears
darker around its limb, or edge; here we are seeing the upper
photosphere, which is relatively cool and thus glows less brightly. (The
dark sunspots, which we discuss in Section 16-8, are also relatively cool
regions.) (Celestron International)

Our Star, the Sun

Why, then, does the Sun appear to have a sharp, well-defined
surface? The reason is that essentially all of the Sun’s visible light
emanates from a single, thin layer of gas called the photosphere
(“sphere of light”). Just as you can see only a certain distance
through the Earth’s atmosphere before objects vanish in the haze,
we can see only about 400 km into the photosphere. This distance
is so small compared with the Sun’s radius of 696,000 km that
the photosphere appears to be a definite surface.
The photosphere is actually the lowest of the three layers that
together constitute the solar atmosphere. Above it are the chromosphere and the corona, both of which are transparent to visible light. We can see them only using special techniques, which
we discuss later in this chapter. Everything below the photosphere
is called the solar interior.

The Lesson of Limb Darkening
The photosphere is heated from below by energy streaming outward from the solar interior. Hence, temperature should decrease
as you go upward in the photosphere, just as in the solar interior
(see Table 16-2 and Figure 16-3). We know this is the case because the photosphere appears darker around the edge, or limb,
of the Sun than it does toward the center of the solar disk, an effect called limb darkening (examine Figure 16-7). This happens
because when we look near the Sun’s limb, we do not see as
deeply into the photosphere as we do when we look near the center of the disk (Figure 16-8). The high-altitude gas we observe at
the limb is not as hot and thus does not glow as brightly as the
deeper, hotter gas seen near the disk center.

An observer looking at the Sun’s
limb can see only part way into
the relatively cool photosphere...
hence this region appears orange
and dim.

An observer looking at the

Figure 16-8
The Origin of Limb Darkening Light from the Sun’s limb and light from
the center of its disk both travel about the same straight-line distance
through the photosphere to reach us. Because of the Sun’s curved shape,
light from the limb comes from a greater height within the photosphere,
where the temperature is lower and the gases glow less brightly. Hence,
the limb appears darker and more orange.

415

The spectrum of the Sun’s photosphere confirms how its temperature varies with altitude. As we saw in Section 16-1, the photosphere shines like a nearly perfect blackbody with an average
temperature of about 5800 K. However, superimposed on this
spectrum are many dark absorption lines (see Figure 5-12). As
discussed in Section 5-6, we see an absorption line spectrum of
this sort whenever we view a hot, glowing object through a relatively cool gas. In this case, the hot object is the lower part of the
photosphere; the cooler gas is in the upper part of the photosphere, where the temperature declines to about 4400 K. All the
absorption lines in the Sun’s spectrum are produced in this relatively cool layer, as atoms selectively absorb photons of various
wavelengths streaming outward from the hotter layers below.

CAUTION! You may find it hard to think of 4400 K as “cool.”
But keep in mind that the ratio of 4400 K to 5800 K, the temperature in the lower photosphere, is the same as the ratio of the
temperature on a Siberian winter night to that of a typical day
in Hawaii.

Granules and Supergranules in the Photosphere
We can learn still more about the photosphere by examining it
with a telescope—but only when using special dark filters to prevent eye damage. Looking directly at the Sun without the correct
filter, whether with the naked eye or with a telescope, can cause
permanent blindness! Under good observing conditions, astronomers using such filter-equipped telescopes can often see a
blotchy pattern in the photosphere, called granulation (Figure
16-9). Each light-colored granule measures about 1000 km
(600 mi) across—equal in size to the areas of Texas and Oklahoma combined—and is surrounded by a darkish boundary. The
difference in brightness between the center and the edge of a granule corresponds to a temperature drop of about 300 K.
Granulation is caused by convection of the gas in the photosphere. The inset in Figure 16-9 shows how gas from lower levels rises upward in granules, cools
off, spills over the edges of the gran- Like water boiling on a

into the Sun. This can occur only if
the gas is heated from below, like a bubbles with convection
pot of water being heated on a stove cells
(see Section 16-2). Along with limb
darkening and the Sun’s absorption line spectrum, granulation
shows that the upper part of the photosphere must be cooler than
the lower part.
Time-lapse photography reveals more of the photosphere’s
dynamic activity. Granules form, disappear, and reform in cycles
lasting only a few minutes. At any one time, about 4 million granules cover the solar surface.
Superimposed on the pattern of granulation are even larger
convection cells called supergranules (Figure 16-10). As in granules, gases rise upward in the middle of a supergranule, move horizontally outward toward its edge, and descend back into the Sun.
The difference is that a typical supergranule is about 35,000 km
in diameter, large enough to enclose several hundred granules.
This large-scale convection moves at only about 0.4 km/s
(1400 km/h, or 900 mi/h), about one-tenth the speed of gases
churning in a granule. A given supergranule lasts about a day.

Solar Granulation High-resolution photographs of
the Sun’s surface reveal a blotchy pattern called
granulation. Granules are convection cells about 1000 km (600 mi) wide
in the Sun’s photosphere. Inset: Rising hot gas produces bright granules.

Cooler gas sinks downward along the boundaries between granules; this
gas glows less brightly, giving the boundaries their dark appearance. This
convective motion transports heat from the Sun’s interior outward to the
solar atmosphere. (MSFC/NASA; inset: Goran Scharmer, Lund Observatory)

ANALOGY Similar patterns of large-scale and small-scale convection can be found in the Earth’s atmosphere. On the large
scale, air rises gradually at a low-pressure area, then sinks gradually at a high-pressure area, which might be hundreds of kilometers away. This is analogous to the flow in a supergranule.
Thunderstorms in our atmosphere are small but intense convection cells within which air moves rapidly up and down. Like
granules, they last only a relatively short time before they
dissipate.

The Photosphere: Hot, Thin, and Opaque
Although the photosphere is a very active place, it actually contains relatively little material. Careful examination of the spectrum shows that it has a density of only about 10⫺4 kg/m3,

Figure 16-10

RI V UXG

Supergranules and Large-Scale Convection Supergranules display
relatively little contrast between their center and edges, so they are hard
to observe in ordinary images. But they can be seen in a false-color
Doppler image like this one. Light from gas that is approaching us (that is,
rising) is shifted toward shorter wavelengths, while light from receding
gas (that is, descending) is shifted toward longer wavelengths (see
Section 5-9). (David Hathaway, MSFC/NASA)

Our Star, the Sun

roughly 0.01% the density of the Earth’s atmosphere at sea level.
The photosphere is made primarily of hydrogen and helium, the
most abundant elements in the solar system (see Figure 8-3).
Despite being such a thin gas, the photosphere is surprisingly
opaque to visible light. If it were not so opaque, we could see into
the Sun’s interior to a depth of hundreds of thousands of kilometers, instead of the mere 400 km that we can see down into the
photosphere. What makes the photosphere so opaque is that its
hydrogen atoms sometimes acquire an extra electron, becoming
negative hydrogen ions. The extra electron is only loosely attached and can be dislodged if it absorbs a photon of any visible
wavelength. Hence, negative hydrogen ions are very efficient light
absorbers, and there are enough of these light-absorbing ions in
the photosphere to make it quite opaque. Because it is so opaque,
the photosphere’s spectrum is close to that of an ideal blackbody.

16-6 Spikes of rising gas extend through
the Sun’s chromosphere
An ordinary visible-light image such as Figure 16-7 gives the impression that the Sun ends at the top of the photosphere. But during a total solar eclipse, the Moon blocks the photosphere from
our view, revealing a glowing, pinkish layer of gas above the photosphere (Figure 16-11). This is the tenuous chromosphere

(“sphere of color”), the second of the three major levels in the
Sun’s atmosphere. The chromosphere is only about one tenthousandth (10⫺4) as dense as the photosphere, or about 10⫺8
as dense as our own atmosphere. No wonder it is normally
invisible!

Comparing the Chromosphere and Photosphere
Unlike the photosphere, which has an absorption line spectrum,
the chromosphere has a spectrum dominated by emission lines.
An emission line spectrum is produced by the atoms of a hot, thin
gas (see Section 5-6 and Section 5-8). As their electrons fall from
higher to lower energy levels, the atoms emit photons.
One of the strongest emission lines in the chromosphere’s
spectrum is the H␣ line at 656.3 nm, which is emitted by a hydrogen atom when its single electron falls from the n ⫽ 3 level to
the n ⫽ 2 level (recall Figure 5-21b). This wavelength is in the red
part of the spectrum, which gives the chromosphere its characteristic pinkish color. The spectrum also contains emission lines of
singly ionized calcium, as well as lines due to ionized helium and
ionized metals. In fact, helium was originally discovered in the
chromospheric spectrum in 1868, almost 30 years before helium
gas was first isolated on Earth.
Analysis of the chromospheric spectrum shows that temperature increases with increasing height in the chromosphere. This
is just the opposite of the situation in the photosphere, where
temperature decreases with increasing height. The temperature is
about 4400 K at the top of the photosphere; 2000 km higher, at
the top of the chromosphere, the temperature is nearly 25,000 K.
This is very surprising, since temperatures should decrease as you
move away from the Sun’s interior. In Section 16-10 we will see
how solar scientists explain this seeming paradox.
BL

INK 1

6.8

The photospheric spectrum is dominated by absorption lines at certain wavelengths, while the spectrum of
the chromosphere has emission lines at these same
wavelengths. In other words, the photosphere appears dark at the
wavelengths at which the chromosphere emits most strongly, such
as the H␣ wavelength of 656.3 nm. By viewing the Sun through
a special filter that is transparent to light only at the wavelength
of H␣, astronomers can screen out light from the photosphere and
make the chromosphere visible. (The same technique can be used
with other wavelengths at which the chromosphere emits strongly,
including nonvisible wavelengths.) This makes it possible to see
the chromosphere at any time, not just during a solar eclipse.

pinkish because its hot gases emit light at only certain discrete
wavelengths, principally the H␣ emission of hydrogen at a red wavelength

chromospheric gas that surge upward into the Sun’s outer atmosphere.

kilometers in height rise
just 15 minutes or so: It rises at the
rate of about 20 km/s (72,000 km/h, through the

of several thousand kilometers, and
then collapses and fades away (Figure 16-12). Approximately
300,000 spicules exist at any one time, covering about 1% of the
Sun’s surface.

three layers of the solar atmosphere. The lowest, the
photosphere, is about 400 km thick. The chromosphere extends about
2000 km higher, with spicules jutting up to nearly 10,000 km above the
photosphere. Above a transition region is the Sun’s outermost layer, the
corona, which we discuss in Section 16-7. It extends many millions of
kilometers out into space. (Adapted from J. A. Eddy)

Like the chromosphere that lies below it, the corona has an emission line spectrum characteristic of a hot, thin gas. When the
spectrum of the corona was first measured in the nineteenth century, astronomers found a number of emission lines at wavelengths that had never been seen in the laboratory. Their
explanation was that the corona contained elements that had not
yet been detected on the Earth. However, laboratory experiments
in the 1930s revealed that these unusual emission lines were in
fact caused by the same atoms found elsewhere in the universe—
but in highly ionized states. For example, a prominent green line
at 530.3 nm is caused by highly ionized iron atoms, each of which
has been stripped of 13 of its 26 electrons. In order to strip that
many electrons from atoms, temperatures in the corona must
reach 2 million kelvins (2 ⫻ 106 K) or even higher—far greater
than the temperatures in the chromosphere. Figure 16-14 shows
how temperature in both the chromosphere and corona varies
with altitude.

CAUTION! The corona is actually not very “hot”—that is, it
contains very little thermal energy. The reason is that the corona
is nearly a vacuum. In the corona there are only about 1011 atoms

Spicules are generally located directly above the edges of supergranules (see Figure 16-10). This is a surprising result, because
chromospheric gases are rising in a spicule while photospheric
gases are descending at the edge of a supergranule. What, then, is
pulling gases upward to form spicules? As we will see in Section
16-10, the answer proves to be the Sun’s intense magnetic field.
But before we delve into how this happens, let us complete our
tour of the solar atmosphere by exploring its outermost, least
dense, most dynamic, and most bizarre layer—the region called
the corona.

16-7 The corona ejects mass into space
to form the solar wind
The corona, or outermost region of the Sun’s atmosphere, begins
at the top of the chromosphere. It extends out to a distance of several million kilometers. Despite its tremendous extent, the corona
is only about one-millionth (10⫺6) as bright as the photosphere—
no brighter than the full moon. Hence, the corona can be viewed
only when the light from the photosphere is blocked out, either
by use of a specially designed telescope or during a total eclipse.
Figure 16-13 is an exceptionally detailed photograph of the
Sun’s corona taken during a solar eclipse. It shows that the corona is not merely a spherical shell of gas surrounding the Sun.

The Earth’s gravity keeps our atmosphere from escaping into
space. In the same way, the Sun’s powerful gravitational attraction keeps most of the gases of the photosphere, chromosphere,
and corona from escaping. But the corona’s high temperature
means that its atoms and ions are moving at very high speeds,
around a million kilometers per hour. As a result, some of the
coronal gas can and does escape. This outflow of gas, which we
first encountered in Section 8-5, is called the solar wind.
Each second the Sun ejects about a million tons (109 kg) of
material into the solar wind. But the Sun is so massive that, even
over its entire lifetime, it will eject only a few tenths of a percent
of its total mass. The solar wind is composed almost entirely of
electrons and nuclei of hydrogen and helium. About 0.1% of the
solar wind is made up of ions of more massive atoms, such as silicon, sulfur, calcium, chromium, nickel, iron, and argon. The aurorae seen at far northern or southern latitudes on Earth are
produced when electrons and ions from the solar wind enter our
upper atmosphere.
Special telescopes enable astronomers to see the origin of the
solar wind. To appreciate what sort of telescopes are needed, note
that because the temperature of the coronal gas is so high, ions
in the corona are moving very fast (see Box 7-2). When ions collide, the energy of the impact is so great that the ion’s electrons
are boosted to very high energy levels. As the electrons fall back
to lower levels, they emit high-energy photons in the ultraviolet
and X-ray portions of the spectrum—wavelengths at which the
photosphere and chromosphere are relatively dim. Hence, telescopes sensitive to these short wavelengths are ideal for studying
the corona and the flow of the solar wind.
BL

The Earth’s atmosphere is opaque to ultraviolet light
and X rays, so telescopes for these wavelengths must
be placed on board spacecraft (see Section 6-7, especially Figure 6-25). Figure 16-15 shows an ultraviolet view of the
corona from the SOHO spacecraft (Solar and Heliospheric Observatory), a joint project of the European Space Agency (ESA)
and NASA.
Figure 16-15 reveals that the corona is not uniform in temperature or density. The densest, highest-temperature regions

of the oven and the air inside the oven are at the same high temperature, but the air contains very few atoms and thus carries
little energy. If you put your hand in the oven momentarily, the
lion’s share of the heat you feel is radiation from the oven walls.

Evidence in favor of this picture has come from the
Ulysses spacecraft, another joint ESA/NASA mission.
In 1994 and 1995, Ulysses became the first spacecraft
to fly over the Sun’s north and south poles, where there are apparently permanent coronal holes. The spacecraft indeed measured a stronger solar wind emanating from these holes.
.10

The low density of the corona explains why it is so dim compared with the photosphere. In general, the higher the temperature of a gas, the brighter it glows. But because there are so few
atoms in the corona, the net amount of light that it emits is very
feeble compared with the light from the much cooler, but also
much denser, photosphere.

temperature, the atoms there are moving at very high speeds.
But because there are so few atoms in the corona, the total
amount of energy in these moving atoms (a measure of how
“hot” the gas is) is rather low. If you flew a spaceship into the
corona, you would have to worry about becoming overheated
by the intense light coming from the photosphere, but you would
notice hardly any heating from the corona’s ultra-thin gas.

The temperatures in the corona and the chromosphere are
not at all what we would expect. Just as you feel warm if you
stand close to a campfire but cold if you move away, we would
expect that the temperature in the corona and chromosphere
would decrease with increasing altitude and, hence, increasing
distance from the warmth of the Sun’s photosphere. Why, then,
does the temperature in these regions increase with increasing altitude? This has been one of the major unsolved mysteries in astronomy for the past half-century. As astronomers have tried to
resolve this dilemma, they have found important clues in one of
the Sun’s most familiar features—sunspots.

The Ultraviolet Corona The SOHO spacecraft recorded this
false-color ultraviolet view of the solar corona. The dark
feature running across the Sun’s disk from the top is a coronal hole, a
region where the coronal gases are thinner than elsewhere. Such holes
are often the source of strong gusts in the solar wind.
(SOHO/EIT/ESA/NASA)

Granules, supergranules, spicules, and the solar wind occur continuously. These features are said to be aspects of the quiet Sun.
But other, more dramatic features appear periodically, including
massive eruptions and regions of concentrated magnetic fields.
When these are present, astronomers refer to the active Sun. The
features of the active Sun that can most easily be seen with even
a small telescope (although only with an appropriate filter attached) are sunspots.

Observing Sunspots
Sunspots are irregularly shaped dark regions in the photosphere.
Sometimes sunspots appear in isolation (Figure 16-16a), but frequently they are found in sunspot groups (Figure 16-16b; see also
Figure 16-7). Although sunspots vary greatly in size, typical ones

measure a few tens of thousands of kilometers across—comparable
to the diameter of the Earth. Sunspots are not permanent features
of the photosphere but last between a few hours and a few months.
Each sunspot has a dark central core, called the umbra, and
a brighter border called the penumbra. We used these same terms
in Section 3-4 to refer to different parts of the Earth’s or the
Moon’s shadow. But a sunspot is not a shadow; it is a region in
the photosphere where the temperature is relatively low, which
makes it appear darker than its surroundings. If the surrounding
photosphere is blocked from view, a sunspot’s umbra appears red
and the penumbra appears orange. As we saw in Section 5-4,
Wien’s law relates the color of a blackbody (which depends on
the wavelength at which it emits the most light) to the blackbody’s temperature. The colors of a sunspot indicate that the temperature of the umbra is typically 4300 K and that of the penumbra
is typically 5000 K. While high by earthly standards, these temperatures are quite a bit lower than the average photospheric temperature of 5800 K.
The Stefan-Boltzmann law (see Section 5-4) tells us that the
energy flux from a blackbody is proportional to the fourth power
of its temperature. This law lets us compare the amounts of light
energy emitted by a square meter of a sunspot’s umbra and by a
square meter of undisturbed photosphere. The ratio is:

Tracking the Sun’s Rotation with Sunspots This series of
photographs taken in 1999 shows the rotation of the Sun. By
observing the same group of sunspots from one day to the next, Galileo
found that the Sun rotates once in about four weeks. (The equatorial
regions of the Sun actually rotate somewhat faster than the polar
regions.) Notice how the sunspot group shown here changed its shape.

That is, the umbra emits only 30% as much light as an equally

The Sunspot Cycle
The average number of sunspots on the Sun is not constant, but
varies in a predictable sunspot cycle (Figure 16-18a). This phenomenon was first reported by the German astronomer Heinrich
Schwabe in 1843 after many years
of observing. As Figure 16-18a The number of sunspots
shows, the average number of
increases and decreases
sunspots varies with a period of
about 11 years. A period of excep- on an 11-year cycle
tionally many sunspots is a sunspot
maximum (Figure 16-18b), as occurred in 1979, 1989, and 2000.
Conversely, the Sun is almost devoid of sunspots at a sunspot
minimum (Figure 16-18c), as occurred in 1976, 1986, and 1996
and is projected to occur in 2007.
The locations of sunspots also vary with the same 11-year
sunspot cycle. At the beginning of a cycle, just after a sunspot

(NASA Marshall Space Flight Center)

minimum, sunspots first appear at latitudes around 30° north and
south of the solar equator (Figure 16-19). Over the succeeding
years, the sunspots occur closer and closer to the equator.

16-9 Sunspots are produced by a 22-year
cycle in the Sun’s magnetic field
Why should the number of sunspots vary with an 11-year cycle?
Why should their average latitude vary over the course of a cycle? And why should sunspots exist at all? The first step toward
answering these questions came in 1908, when the American astronomer George Ellery Hale discovered that sunspots are associated with intense magnetic fields on the Sun.

Probing Solar Magnetism
DEEPE
NG

When Hale focused a spectroscope on sunlight coming from a sunspot, he found that many spectral lines
appear to be split into several closely spaced lines (Figure 16-20). This “splitting” of spectral lines is called the Zeeman
effect, after the Dutch physicist Pieter Zeeman, who first observed
it in his laboratory in 1896. Zeeman showed that a spectral line
splits when the atoms are subjected to an intense magnetic field.
The more intense the magnetic field, the wider the separation of
the split lines.
Hale’s discovery showed that sunspots are places where the
hot gases of the photosphere are bathed in a concentrated magnetic field. Many of the atoms of the Sun’s atmosphere are ionized due to the high temperature. The solar atmosphere is thus a
special type of gas called a plasma, in which electrically charged
ions and electrons can move freely. Like any moving, electrically
charged objects, they can be deflected by magnetic fields. Figure
16-21 shows how a magnetic field in the laboratory bends a beam
of fast-moving electrons into a curved trajectory. Similarly, the
paths of moving ions and electrons in the photosphere are deflected by the Sun’s magnetic field. In particular, magnetic forces
act on the hot plasma that rises from the Sun’s interior due to
convection. Where the magnetic field is particularly strong, these

Occasionally, a sunspot group is large enough to be seen without
a telescope. Chinese astronomers recorded such sightings 2000
years ago, and huge sunspot groups visible to the naked eye (with
an appropriate filter) were seen in 1989 and 2003. But it was not
until Galileo introduced the telescope into astronomy (see Section
4-5) that anyone was able to examine sunspots in detail.
Galileo discovered that he could determine the Sun’s rotation
rate by tracking sunspots as they moved across the solar disk (Figure 16-17). He found that the Sun rotates once in about four
weeks. A typical sunspot group lasts about two months, so a specific one can be followed for two solar rotations.
Further observations by the British astronomer Richard Carrington in 1859 demonstrated that the Sun does not rotate as a
rigid body. Instead, the equatorial regions rotate more rapidly
than the polar regions. This phenomenon is known as differential
rotation. Thus, while a sunspot near the solar equator takes only
25 days to go once around the Sun, a sunspot at 30° north or
south of the equator takes 271⁄2 days. The rotation period at
75° north or south is about 33 days, while near the poles it may
be as long as 35 days.

each sunspot cycle, most sunspots are found near latitudes 30° north or
south. As the cycle goes on, sunspots typically form closer to the equator.

forces push the hot plasma away. The result is a localized region
where the gas is relatively cool and thus glows less brightly—in
other words, a sunspot.
To get a fuller picture of the Sun’s magnetic fields, astronomers take images of the Sun at two wavelengths, one just
less than and one just greater than the wavelength of a magnetically split spectral line. From the difference between these two
images, they can construct a picture called a magnetogram,
which displays the magnetic fields in the solar atmosphere. Figure 16-22a is an ordinary white-light photograph of the Sun taken
at the same time as the magnetogram in Figure 16-22b. In the
magnetogram, dark blue indicates areas of the photosphere with
one magnetic polarity (north), and yellow indicates areas with the
opposite (south) magnetic polarity. This image shows that many
sunspot groups have roughly comparable areas covered by north

Mapping the Sun’s Magnetic Field (a) This visible-light image and
(b) this false-color magnetogram were recorded at the same time. Dark
blue and yellow areas in the magnetogram have north and south
magnetic polarity, respectively; blue-green regions have weak magnetic

and south magnetic polarities (see also Figure 16-22c). Thus, a
sunspot group resembles a giant bar magnet, with a north magnetic pole at one end and a south magnetic pole at the other.
If different sunspot groups were unrelated to one another,
their magnetic poles would be randomly oriented, like a bunch of
compass needles all pointing in random directions. As Hale discovered, however, there is a striking regularity in the magnetization of sunspot groups. As a given sunspot group moves with the
Sun’s rotation, the sunspots in front are called the “preceding
members” of the group. The spots that follow behind are referred
to as the “following members.” Hale compared the sunspot groups
in the two solar hemispheres, north or south of the Sun’s equator. He found that the preceding members in one solar hemisphere all have the same magnetic polarity, while the preceding
members in the other hemisphere have the opposite polarity. Furthermore, in the hemisphere where the Sun has its north magnetic
pole, the preceding members of all sunspot groups have north
magnetic polarity. In the opposite hemisphere, where the Sun has
its south magnetic pole, the preceding members all have south
magnetic polarity.
Along with his colleague Seth B. Nicholson, Hale also discovered that the Sun’s polarity pattern completely reverses itself every
11 years—the same interval as the time from one solar maximum
to the next. The hemisphere that has preceding north magnetic
poles during one 11-year sunspot cycle will have preceding south
magnetic poles during the next 11-year cycle, and vice versa. The
north and south magnetic poles of the Sun itself also reverse every
11 years. Thus, the Sun’s magnetic pattern repeats itself only after two sunspot cycles, which is why astronomers speak of a
22-year solar cycle.

The Magnetic-Dynamo Model
In 1960, the American astronomer Horace Babcock proposed a description that seems to account for many features of this 22-year

fields. The highly magnetized regions in (b) correlate with the sunspots in

solar cycle. Babcock’s scenario, called a magnetic-dynamo model,
makes use of two basic properties of the Sun’s photosphere—
differential rotation and convection. Differential rotation causes the
magnetic field in the photosphere to become wrapped around the
Sun (Figure 16-23). As a result, the magnetic field becomes concentrated at certain latitudes on either side of the solar equator. Convection in the photosphere creates tangles in the concentrated
magnetic field, and “kinks” erupt through the solar surface.
Sunspots appear where the magnetic field protrudes through the
photosphere. The theory suggests that sunspots should appear first
at northern and southern latitudes and later form nearer to the
equator. This is just what is observed (see Figure 16-19). Note also
that as shown on the far right in Figure 16-23, the preceding member of a sunspot group has the same polarity (N or S) as the Sun’s
magnetic pole in that hemisphere. This is just as Hale observed.
Differential rotation eventually undoes the twisted magnetic
field. The preceding members of sunspot groups move toward the
Sun’s equator, while the following members migrate toward the
poles. Because the preceding members from the two hemispheres
have opposite magnetic polarities, their magnetic fields cancel
each other out when they meet at
the equator. The following members The Sun’s differential
in each hemisphere have the opporotation makes the
site polarity to the Sun’s pole in that
hemisphere; hence, when they con- magnetic field twist like
verge on the pole, the following a rubber band
members first cancel out and then
reverse the Sun’s overall magnetic field. The fields are now completely relaxed. Once again, differential rotation begins to twist
the Sun’s magnetic field, but now with all magnetic polarities reversed. In this way, Babcock’s model helps to explain the change
in field direction every 11 years.
Recent discoveries in helioseismology (Section 16-3) offer
new insights into the Sun’s magnetic field. By comparing the

speeds of sound waves that travel with and against the Sun’s rotation, helioseismologists have been able to determine the Sun’s
rotation rate at different depths and latitudes. As shown in Figure 16-24, the Sun’s surface pattern of differential rotation persists through the convective zone. Farther in, within the radiative
zone, the Sun seems to rotate like a rigid object with a period of
27 days at all latitudes. Astronomers suspect that the Sun’s magnetic field originates in a relatively thin layer where the radiative
and convective zones meet and slide past each other due to their
different rotation rates.
One dilemma about sunspots is that compressed magnetic
fields tend to push themselves apart, which means that sunspots
should dissipate rather quickly. Yet observations show that
sunspots can persist for many weeks. The resolution of this paradox may have been found using helioseismology (see Section
16-3). Analysis of the vibrations of the Sun around sunspots
shows that beneath the surface of the photosphere, the gases surrounding each sunspot are circulating at high speed—rather like
a hurricane as large as the Earth. The circulation of charged gases
around the magnetic field holds the fields in place, thus stabilizing the sunspot.
Much about sunspots and solar activity remains mysterious.
There are perplexing irregularities in the solar cycle. For example,
the overall reversal of the Sun’s magnetic field is often piecemeal
and haphazard. One pole may reverse polarity long before the
other. For several weeks the Sun’s surface may have two north
magnetic poles and no south magnetic pole at all.
What is more, there seem to be times when all traces of
sunspots and the sunspot cycle vanish for many years. For

example, virtually no sunspots were seen from 1645 through
1715. Curiously, during these same years Europe experienced
record low temperatures, often referred to as the Little Ice Age,
whereas the western United States was subjected to severe drought.
By contrast, there was apparently a period of increased sunspot
activity during the eleventh and twelfth centuries, during which
the Earth was warmer than it is today. Thus, variations in solar
activity appear to affect climates on the Earth. The origin of this
Sun-Earth connection is a topic of ongoing research.

16-10 The Sun’s magnetic field heats
the corona, produces flares, and
causes massive eruptions
Astronomers now understand that the Sun’s magnetic field does
more than just explain the presence of sunspots. It is also responsible for the existence of spicules, as well as a host of other dramatic phenomena in the chromosphere and corona.

The tendency of plasma to follow the Sun’s magnetic field
can also explain why the temperature of the chromosphere and
corona is so high. Spacecraft observations show magnetic field
arches extending tens of thousands of kilometers into the corona,
with streamers of electrically charged particles moving along each
arch (Figure 16-25a). If the magnetic fields of two arches come
into proximity, their magnetic fields can rearrange in a process
called magnetic reconnection (Figure 16-25b). The tremendous
amount of energy stored in the magnetic field is then released into
the solar atmosphere. (A single arch contains as much energy as
a hydroelectric power plant would generate in a million years.)
The amount of energy released in this way appears to be more
than enough to maintain the temperatures of the chromosphere
and corona.

ANALOGY The idea that a magnetic field can heat gases has
applications on Earth as well as on the Sun. In an automobile
engine’s ignition system an electric current is set up in a coil of
wire, which produces a magnetic field. When the current is shut
off, the magnetic field collapses and its energy is directed to a
spark plug in one of the engine’s cylinders. The released energy
heats the mixture of air and gasoline around the plug, causing
the mixture to ignite. This drives the piston in that cylinder and
makes the automobile go.

In a plasma, magnetic field lines and the material of the plasma
tend to move together. This means that as convection pushes material toward the edge of a supergranule, it pushes magnetic field
lines as well. The result is that vertical magnetic field lines pile up
around a supergranule. Plasma that “sticks” to these magnetic
field lines thus ends up lifted upward, forming a spicule (see Figures 16-12 and 16-13).

ejection, more than 1012 kilograms (a billion tons) of hightemperature coronal gas is blasted into space at speeds of hundreds of kilometers per second. A typical coronal mass ejection

to 5 ⫻ 106 K and vast quantities of particles and radiation—
including as much material as is in the prominence shown in
Figure 16-27—are blasted out into space. These eruptions can also
cause disturbances that spread outward in the solar atmosphere,

bright regions in Figure 16-15.) The intense magnetic field of the
sunspots helps trap and compress hot coronal gas, giving it such
a high temperature that it emits copious amounts of high-energy
ultraviolet photons and even more energetic X-ray photons.

Prominences, Flares, ands Coronal Mass Ejections
Spicules and coronal heating occur even when the Sun is quiet.
But magnetic fields can also explain many aspects of the active
Sun in addition to sunspots. Figure 16-26 is an image of the chromosphere made with an H␣ filter during a sunspot maximum.
The bright areas are called plages (from the French word for
“beach”). These are bright, hot regions in the chromosphere that
tend to form just before the appearance of new sunspots. They
are probably created by magnetic fields that push upward from
the Sun’s interior, compressing and heating a portion of the chromosphere. The dark streaks, called filaments, are relatively cool
and dense parts of the chromosphere that have been pulled along
with magnetic field lines as they arch to high altitudes.
When seen from the side, so that they are viewed against
the dark background of space, filaments appear as bright, arching columns of gas called prominences (Figure 16-27). They can
extend for tens of thousands of kilometers above the photosphere. Some prominences last for only a few hours, while others persist for many months. The most energetic prominences
break free of the magnetic fields that confined them and burst
into space.

If a solar flare or coronal mass ejection happens to be
aimed toward Earth, a stream of high-energy electrons
and nuclei reaches us a few days later (Figure 16-28b).
When this plasma arrives, it can interfere with satellites, pose a
health hazard to astronauts in orbit, and disrupt electrical and
communications equipment on the Earth’s surface. Telescopes on
Earth and on board spacecraft now monitor the Sun continuously
to provide warnings of dangerous levels of solar particles.
The numbers of plages, filaments, solar flares, and coronal
mass ejections all vary with the same 11-year cycle as sunspots.
But unlike sunspots, coronal mass ejections never completely
cease, even when the Sun is at its quietest. Astronomers are devoting substantial effort to understanding these and other aspects
of our dynamic Sun.

Hydrogen Fusion in the Sun’s Core: The Sun’s energy is produced
by hydrogen fusion, a sequence of thermonuclear reactions in
which four hydrogen nuclei combine to produce a single helium
nucleus.
• The energy released in a nuclear reaction corresponds to a slight
reduction of mass according to Einstein’s equation E ⫽ mc2.
• Thermonuclear fusion occurs only at very high temperatures;
for example, hydrogen fusion occurs only at temperatures in excess of about 107 K. In the Sun, fusion occurs only in the dense,
hot core.

Our Star, the Sun

Models of the Sun’s Interior: A theoretical description of a star’s
interior can be calculated using the laws of physics.
• The standard model of the Sun suggests that hydrogen fusion
takes place in a core extending from the Sun’s center to about
0.25 solar radius.
• The core is surrounded by a radiative zone extending to about
0.71 solar radius. In this zone, energy travels outward through radiative diffusion.
• The radiative zone is surrounded by a rather opaque convective
zone of gas at relatively low temperature and pressure. In this
zone, energy travels outward primarily through convection.
Solar Neutrinos and Helioseismology: Conditions in the solar interior can be inferred from measurements of solar neutrinos and
of solar vibrations.
• Neutrinos emitted in thermonuclear reactions in the Sun’s core
have been detected, but in smaller numbers than expected. Recent
neutrino experiments explain why this is so.
• Helioseismology is the study of how the Sun vibrates. These vibrations have been used to infer pressures, densities, chemical
compositions, and rotation rates within the Sun.

The Sun’s Atmosphere: The Sun’s atmosphere has three
main layers: the photosphere, the chromosphere, and
the corona. Everything below the solar atmosphere is
called the solar interior.

• The visible surface of the Sun, the photosphere, is the lowest
layer in the solar atmosphere. Its spectrum is similar to that of a
blackbody at a temperature of 5800 K. Convection in the photosphere produces granules.
• Above the photosphere is a layer of less dense but highertemperature gases called the chromosphere. Spicules extend upward from the photosphere into the chromosphere along the
boundaries of supergranules.
• The outermost layer of the solar atmosphere, the corona, is
made of very high-temperature gases at extremely low density.
Activity in the corona includes coronal mass ejections and coronal holes. The solar corona blends into the solar wind at great
distances from the Sun.
The Active Sun: The Sun’s surface features vary in an 11-year cycle. This is related to a 22-year cycle in which the surface magnetic field increases, decreases, and then increases again with the
opposite polarity.
• Sunspots are relatively cool regions produced by local concentrations of the Sun’s magnetic field. The average number of
sunspots increases and decreases in a regular cycle of approximately 11 years, with reversed magnetic polarities from one
11-year cycle to the next. Two such cycles make up the 22-year
solar cycle.
• The magnetic-dynamo model suggests that many features of
the solar cycle are due to changes in the Sun’s magnetic field.
These changes are caused by convection and the Sun’s differential
rotation.
• A solar flare is a brief eruption of hot, ionized gases from a
sunspot group. A coronal mass ejection is a much larger eruption
that involves immense amounts of gas from the corona.

Problem-solving tips and tools
You may have to review Wien’s law and the StefanBoltzmann law, which are the subjects of Section 5-4. Section
5-5 discusses the properties of photons. As we described in
Box 5-2, you can simplify calculations by taking ratios, such
as the ratio of the flux from a sunspot to the flux from the
undisturbed photosphere. When you do this, all the cumbersome constants cancel out. Figure 5-7 shows the various parts
of the electromagnetic spectrum. We introduced the Doppler
effect in Section 5-9 and Box 5-6. For information about the
planets, see Table 7-1.
29. Calculate how much energy would be released if each of the
following masses were converted entirely into their equivalent energy: (a) a carbon atom with a mass of 2 ⫻ 10⫺26 kg,
(b) 1 kilogram, and (c) a planet as massive as the Earth
(6 ⫻ 1024 kg).
30. Use the luminosity of the Sun (given in Table 16-1) and the
answers to the previous question to calculate how long the
Sun must shine in order to release an amount of energy equal
to that produced by the complete mass-to-energy conversion
of (a) a carbon atom, (b) 1 kilogram, and (c) the Earth.
31. Assuming that the current rate of hydrogen fusion in the Sun
remains constant, what fraction of the Sun’s mass will be
converted into helium over the next 5 billion years? How will
this affect the overall chemical composition of the Sun?
32. (a) Estimate how many kilograms of hydrogen the Sun has
consumed over the past 4.56 billion years, and estimate the
amount of mass that the Sun has lost as a result. Assume that
the Sun’s luminosity has remained constant during that time.
(b) In fact, the Sun’s luminosity when it first formed was only
about 70% of its present value. With this in mind, explain
whether your answers to part (a) are an overestimate or an
underestimate.

drogen. Explain why, and explain what happens to the other
0.5 kg. (Hint: How many 1H nuclei are used to make the two
3He nuclei shown in the Cosmic Connections figure in Section 16-1? How many of these 1H nuclei end up being incorporated into the 4He nucleus shown in the figure?)
(a) A positron has the same mass as an electron (see Appendix 7). Calculate the amount of energy released by the annihilation of an electron and positron. (b) The products of this
annihilation are two photons, each of equal energy. Calculate
the wavelength of each photon, and confirm from Figure
5-7 that this wavelength is the gamma-ray range.
Sirius is the brightest star in the night sky. It has a luminosity of 23.5 L䉺, that is, it is 23.5 times as luminous as the Sun
and burns hydrogen at a rate 23.5 times greater than the Sun.
How many kilograms of hydrogen does Sirius convert into
helium each second?
(Refer to the preceding question.) Sirius has 2.3 times the
mass of the Sun. Do you expect that the lifetime of Sirius will
be longer, shorter, or the same length as that of the Sun? Explain your reasoning.
(a) If the Sun were not in a state of hydrostatic equilibrium,
would its diameter remain the same? Explain your reasoning.
(b) If the Sun were not in a state of thermal equilibrium,
would its luminosity remain the same? What about its surface temperature? Explain your reasoning.
Using the mass and size of the Sun given in Table 16-1, verify that the average density of the Sun is 1410 kg/m3. Compare your answer with the average densities of the Jovian
planets.
Use the data in Table 16-2 to calculate the average density of
material within 0.1 R䉺 of the center of the Sun. (You will
need to use the mass and radius of the Sun as a whole, given
in Table 16-1.) Explain why your answer is not the same as
the density at 0.1 R䉺 given in Table 16-2.
In a typical solar oscillation, the Sun’s surface moves up or
down at a maximum speed of 0.1 m/s. An astronomer sets
out to measure this speed by detecting the Doppler shift of
an absorption line of iron with wavelength 557.6099 nm.
What is the maximum wavelength shift that she will observe?
Explain why the results from the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) only provide an answer to the solar neutrino
problem for relatively high-energy neutrinos. (Hint: Can SNO
detect solar neutrinos of all energies?)
The amount of energy required to dislodge the extra electron
from a negative hydrogen ion is 1.2 ⫻ 10–19 J. (a) The extra
electron can be dislodged if the ion absorbs a photon of sufficiently short wavelength. (Recall from Section 5-5 that the
higher the energy of a photon, the shorter its wavelength.)
Find the longest wavelength (in nm) that can accomplish this.
(b) In what part of the electromagnetic spectrum does this
wavelength lie? (c) Would a photon of visible light be able to
dislodge the extra electron? Explain. (d) Explain why the
photosphere, which contains negative hydrogen ions, is quite
opaque to visible light but is less opaque to light with wavelengths longer than the value you calculated in (a).
Astronomers often use an H␣ filter to view the chromosphere.
Explain why this can also be accomplished with filters that
are transparent only to the wavelengths of the H and K lines

in the spectrum of the photosphere.)
44. Calculate the wavelengths at which the photosphere, chromosphere, and corona emit the most radiation. Explain how
the results of your calculations suggest the best way to observe these regions of the solar atmosphere. (Hint: Treat each
part of the atmosphere as a perfect blackbody. Assume average temperatures of 50,000 K and 1.5 ⫻ 106 K for the chromosphere and corona, respectively.)
45. On November 15, 1999, the planet Mercury passed in front

penumbra to the energy flux from an equally large patch of
undisturbed photosphere. Which patch is brighter? (b) Find
the ratio of the energy flux from a patch of a sunspot’s
penumbra to the energy flux from an equally large patch of
umbra. Again, which patch is brighter?
Suppose that you want to determine the Sun’s rotation rate
by observing its sunspots. Is it necessary to take the Earth’s
orbital motion into account? Why or why not?
(a) Using a ruler to make measurements of Figure 16-25, determine how far the arches in that figure extend above the
Sun’s surface. The diameter of the Earth is 12,756 km. (b) In
Figure 16-25 (an ultraviolet image) the photosphere appears
dark compared to the arches. Explain why.
The amount of visible light emitted by the Sun varies only a
little over the 11-year sunspot cycle. But the amount of
X rays emitted by the Sun can be 10 times greater at solar
maximum than at solar minimum. Explain why these two
types of radiation should be so different in their variability.

HT

At the risk of repeating ourselves, we remind you to never
look directly at the Sun, because it can easily cause permanent blindness. You can view the Sun safely without a telescope just by using two pieces of white cardboard. First, use
a pin to poke a small hole in one piece of cardboard; this will
be your “lens,” and the other piece of cardboard will be your
“viewing screen.” Hold the “lens” piece of cardboard so that
it is face-on to the Sun and sunlight can pass through the
hole. With your other hand, hold the “viewing screen” so
that the sunlight from the “lens” falls on it. Adjust the distance between the two pieces of cardboard so that you see a
sharp image of the Sun on the “viewing screen.” This image
is perfectly safe to view. It is actually possible to see sunspots
with this low-tech apparatus.
For a better view, use a telescope with a solar filter that
fits on the front of the telescope. A standard solar filter is a
piece of glass coated with a thin layer of metal to give it a
mirrorlike appearance. This coating reflects almost all the
sunlight that falls on it, so that only a tiny, safe amount of
sunlight enters the telescope. An H␣ filter, which looks like a
red piece of glass, keeps the light at a safe level by admitting
only a very narrow range of wavelengths. (Filters that fit on
the back of the telescope are not recommended. The telescope
focuses concentrated sunlight on such a filter, heating it and
making it susceptible to cracking—and if the filter cracks
when you are looking through it, your eye will be ruined instantly and permanently.)
To use a telescope with a solar filter, first aim the telescope away from the Sun, then put on the filter. Keep the lens
cap on the telescope’s secondary wide-angle “finder scope”
(if it has one), because the heat of sunlight can fry the finder
scope’s optics. Next, aim the telescope toward the Sun, using
the telescope’s shadow to judge when you are pointed in the
right direction. You can then safely look through the telescope’s eyepiece. When you are done, make sure you point
the telescope away from the Sun before removing the filter
and storing the telescope.
Note that the amount of solar activity that you can see
(sunspots, filaments, flares, prominences, and so on) will depend on where the Sun is in its 11-year sunspot cycle.

huge distances, it must be that the luminosity of the stars—that
is, how much energy they emit into space per second—is comparable to or greater than that of the Sun. Just as for the Sun, the
only explanation for such tremendous luminosities is that thermonuclear reactions are occurring within the stars (see Section 16-1).
Clearly, then, it is important to know how distant the stars
are. But how do we measure these distances? You might think
this is done by comparing how bright different stars appear. Perhaps the star Betelgeuse in the constellation Orion appears bright
because it is relatively close, while the dimmer and less conspicuous star Polaris (the North Star, in the constellation Ursa Minor)
is farther away.
But this line of reasoning is incorrect: Polaris is actually closer
to us than Betelgeuse! How bright a star appears is not a good
indicator of its distance. If you see a light on a darkened road, it
could be a motorcycle headlight a kilometer away or a person
holding a flashlight just a few meters away. In the same way, a
bright star might be extremely far away but have an unusually
high luminosity, and a dim star might be relatively close but have
a rather low luminosity. Astronomers must use other techniques
to determine the distances to the stars.

Parallax and the Distances to the Stars
The most straightforward way of measuring stellar distances uses
an effect called parallax. This is the apparent displacement of an
object because of a change in the observer’s point of view (Figure
17-1). To see how parallax works, hold your arm out straight in
front of you. Now look at the hand on your outstretched arm,
first with your left eye closed, then with your right eye closed.
When you close one eye and open the other, your hand appears
to shift back and forth against the background of more distant
objects.

The closer the object you are
You measure distances
viewing, the greater the parallax shift.
To see this, repeat the experiment around you by comparing
with your hand held closer to your the images from your
face. Your brain analyzes such paral- left and right eyes—we
lax shifts constantly as it compares find the distances to
the images from your left and right stars using the same
eyes, and in this way determines the principle
distances to objects around you. This
is the origin of depth perception.
To measure the distance to a star, astronomers measure the
parallax shift of the star using two points of view that are as far
apart as possible—at opposite sides of the Earth’s orbit. The direction from Earth to a nearby star changes as our planet orbits
the Sun, and the nearby star appears to move back and forth
against the background of more distant stars (Figure 17-2). This
motion is called stellar parallax. The parallax (p) of a star is equal
to half the angle through which the star’s apparent position shifts
as the Earth moves from one side of its orbit to the other. The
larger the parallax p, the smaller the distance d to the star (compare Figure 17-2a with Figure 17-2b).
It is convenient to measure the distance d in parsecs. A star
with a parallax angle of 1 second of arc (p ⫽ 1 arcsec) is at a distance of 1 parsec (d ⫽ 1 pc). (The word “parsec” is a contraction
of the phrase “the distance at which a star has a parallax of one
arcsecond.” Recall from Section 1-7 that 1 parsec equals 3.26
light-years, 3.09 ⫻ 1013 km, or 206,265 AU; see Figure 1-14.) If
the angle p is measured in arcseconds, then the distance d to the
star in parsecs is given by the following equation:

d ⫽ distance to a star, in parsecs

This simple relationship between parallax and distance in
parsecs is one of the main reasons that astronomers usually measure cosmic distances in parsecs rather than light-years. For example, a star whose parallax is p ⫽ 0.1 arcsec is at a distance
d ⫽ 1/(0.1) ⫽ 10 parsecs from the Earth. Barnard’s star, named

Stellar Parallax (a) As the Earth orbits the Sun, a nearby
star appears to shift its position against the background of
distant stars. The parallax (p) of the star is equal to the angular radius of

the Earth’s orbit as seen from the star. (b) The closer the star is to us, the

small parallax angles are difficult to detect, so it was not until
1838 that the first successful parallax measurements were made
by the German astronomer and mathematician Friedrich Wilhelm
Bessel. He found the parallax angle of the star 61 Cygni to be just
1/3 arcsec—equal to the angular diameter of a dime at a distance
of 11 kilometers, or 7 miles. He thus determined that this star is
about 3 pc from the Earth. (Modern measurements give a slightly
smaller parallax angle, which means that 61 Cygni is actually
more than 3 pc away.) The star Proxima Centauri has the largest
known parallax angle, 0.772 arcsec, and hence is the closest
known star (other than the Sun); its distance is 1/(0.772) ⫽ 1.30 pc.

effects of the atmosphere. Therefore, the parallax method used
with ground-based telescopes can give fairly reliable distances
only for stars nearer than about 1/0.01 ⫽ 100 pc. But an observatory in space is unhampered by the atmosphere. Observations
made from spacecraft therefore permit astronomers to measure
even smaller parallax angles and thus determine the distances to
more remote stars.

Appendix 4 at the back of this book lists all
the stars within 4 pc of the Sun, as determined
by parallax measurements. Most of these stars
are far too dim to be seen with the naked eye, which is why their
names are probably unfamiliar to you. By contrast, the majority
of the familiar, bright stars in the nighttime sky (listed in Appendix 5) are so far away that their parallaxes cannot be measured
from the Earth’s surface. They appear bright not because they are
close, but because they are far more luminous than the Sun. The
brightest stars in the sky are not necessarily the nearest stars!

Measuring Parallax from Space
Parallax angles smaller than about 0.01 arcsec are extremely difficult to measure from the Earth, in part because of the blurring

In 1989 the European Space Agency (ESA) launched
the satellite Hipparcos, an acronym for High Precision
Parallax Collecting Satellite (and a commemoration of
the ancient Greek astronomer Hipparchus, who created one of
the first star charts). Over more than three years of observations,
the telescope aboard Hipparcos was used to measure the parallaxes of 118,000 stars with an accuracy of 0.001 arcsecond. This
has enabled astronomers to determine stellar distances out to several hundred parsecs, and with much greater precision than has
been possible with ground-based observations. In the years to
come, astronomers will increasingly turn to space-based observations to determine stellar distances.
Unfortunately, most of the stars in the Galaxy are so far
away that their parallax angles are too small to measure even
with an orbiting telescope. Later in this chapter, we will discuss
a technique that can be used to find the distances to these more
remote stars. In Chapters 24 and 26 we will learn about other
techniques that astronomers use to determine the much larger distances to galaxies beyond the Milky Way. These techniques also

Stellar Motions
tars can move through space in any direction. The space velocity of a star describes how fast and in what direction it
S
is moving. As the accompanying figure shows, a star’s space
velocity v can be broken into components parallel and perpendicular to our line of sight.
The component perpendicular to our line of sight—that is,
across the plane of the sky—is called the star’s tangential velocity (vt). To determine it, astronomers must know the distance to a star (d) and its proper motion (␮, the Greek letter
mu), which is the number of arcseconds that the star appears
to move per year on the celestial sphere. Proper motion does
not repeat itself yearly, so it can be distinguished from the apparent back-and-forth motion due to parallax. In terms of a
star’s distance and proper motion, its tangential velocity (in
km/s) is
vt ⫽ 4.74␮d
where ␮ is in arcseconds per year and d is in parsecs. For example, Barnard’s star (Figure 17-3) has a proper motion of
10.358 arcseconds per year and a distance of 1.83 pc. Hence,
its tangential velocity is
vt ⫽ 4.74(10.358)(1.83) ⫽ 89.8 km/s
The component of a star’s motion parallel to our line of
sight—that is, either directly toward us or directly away from
us—is its radial velocity (vr). It can be determined from measurements of the Doppler shifts of the star’s spectral lines (see
Section 5-9 and Box 5-6). If a star is approaching us, the wavelengths of all of its spectral lines are decreased (blueshifted); if
the star is receding from us, the wavelengths are increased
(redshifted). The radial velocity vr is related to the wavelength
shift by the equation

Solving this equation for the radial velocity vr, we find
vr ⫽ (⫺0.000356) c ⫽ (⫺0.000356)(3.00 ⫻ 105 km/s)
⫽ ⫺107 km/s
The negative sign means that Barnard’s star is moving toward
us. You can check this interpretation by noting that the wavelength ␭ ⫽ 516.445 nm received from Barnard’s star is less
than the laboratory wavelength ␭0 ⫽ 516.629 nm; hence, the
light from the star is blueshifted, which indeed means that the
star is approaching. If the star were receding, its radial velocity would be positive.
The illustration shows that the tangential velocity and radial velocity form two sides of a right triangle. The long side
(hypotenuse) of this triangle is the space velocity (v). From the
Pythagorean theorem, the space velocity is

For Barnard’s star, the space velocity is
v ⫽ 兹苶
(89.4

( 107 km/s)

Therefore, Barnard’s star is moving through space at a speed
of 140 km/s (503,000 km/h, or 312,000 mi/h) relative to
the Sun.
Determining the space velocities of stars is essential for understanding the structure of the Galaxy. Studies show that the
stars in our local neighborhood are moving in wide orbits
around the center of the Galaxy, which lies some 8000 pc
(26,000 light-years) away in the direction of the constellation
Sagittarius (the Archer). While many of the orbits are roughly
circular and lie in nearly the same plane, others are highly elliptical or steeply inclined to the galactic plane. We will see in
Chapter 23 how the orbits of stars and gas clouds reveal the
Galaxy’s spiral structure.

help us understand the overall size, age, and structure of the
universe.

The Importance of Parallax Measurements
Because it can be used only on relatively close stars, stellar parallax might seem to be of limited usefulness. But parallax measurements are the cornerstone for all other methods of finding the
distances to remote objects. These other methods require a precise and accurate knowledge of the distances to nearby stars, as
determined by stellar parallax. Hence, any inaccuracies in the
parallax angles for nearby stars can translate into substantial errors in measurement for the whole universe. For this reason,
astronomers are continually trying to perfect their parallaxmeasuring techniques.
Stellar parallax is an apparent motion of stars caused by the
Earth’s orbital motion around the Sun. But stars are not fixed objects and actually do move through space. As a result, stars change
their positions on the celestial sphere (Figure 17-3), and they
move either toward or away from the Sun. These motions are sufficiently slow, however, that changes in the positions of the stars
are hardly noticeable over a human lifetime. Box 17-1 describes
how astronomers study these motions and what insights they gain
from these studies.

luminosity can be determined from its
apparent brightness
All the stars you can see in the nighttime sky shine by thermonuclear fusion, just as the Sun does (see Section 16-1). But they are

To determine the luminosity of a
Apparent brightness is a
star, we first note that as light energy moves away from its source, it measure of how faint a
spreads out over increasingly larger star looks to us;
regions of space. Imagine a sphere of luminosity is a measure
radius d centered on the light source, of the star’s total light
as in Figure 17-4. The amount of en- output
ergy that passes each second through
a square meter of the sphere’s surface area is the total luminosity of the source (L) divided by the
total surface area of the sphere (equal to 4␲d 2). This quantity is
called the apparent brightness of the light, or just brightness (b),
because how bright a light source appears depends on how much
light energy per second enters through the area of a light detector (such as your eye). Apparent brightness is measured in watts
per square meter (W/m2). Written in the form of an equation, the
relationship between apparent brightness and luminosity is
Inverse-square law relating apparent brightness and luminosity
L
b⫽ ᎏ
4␲d 2
b ⫽ apparent brightness of a star’s light, in W/m2
L ⫽ star’s luminosity, in W
d ⫽ distance to star, in meters
This relationship is called the inverse-square law, because the
apparent brightness of light that an observer can see or measure
is inversely proportional to the square of the observer’s distance
(d) from the source. If you double your distance from a light
source, its radiation is spread out over an area 4 times larger, so
the apparent brightness you see is decreased by a factor of 4. Similarly, at triple the distance, the apparent brightness is 1/9 as great
(see Figure 17-4).
We can apply the inverse-square law to the Sun, which is

With greater distance from the star, its light is spread
over a larger area and its apparent brightness is less.

b/b䉺 ⫽ ratio of the star’s apparent brightness to the Sun’s
apparent brightness
We need to know just two things to find a star’s luminosity:
the distance to a star as compared to the Earth-Sun distance (the
ratio d/d䉺), and how that star’s apparent brightness compares to
that of the Sun (the ratio b/b䉺). Then we can use the above equation to find how luminous that star is compared to the Sun (the
ratio L/L䉺).
In other words, this equation gives us a general rule relating
the luminosity, distance, and apparent brightness of a star:

We can determine the luminosity of a star from its distance
and apparent brightness. For a given distance, the brighter the
star, the more luminous that star must be. For a given
apparent brightness, the more distant the star, the more
luminous it must be to be seen at that distance.

Figure 17-4
The Inverse-Square Law Radiation from a light source

illuminates an area that increases as the square of the
distance from the source. Hence, the apparent brightness decreases as
the square of the distance. The brightness at d ⫽ 2 is 1/(22) ⫽ 1/4 of the
brightness at d ⫽ 1, and the brightness at d ⫽ 3 is 1/(32) ⫽ 1/9 of that at
d ⫽ 1.

Astronomers measure the apparent brightness of a star using
a telescope with an attached light-sensitive instrument, similar to
the light meter in a camera that determines the proper exposure.
Measuring a star’s apparent brightness is called photometry.

Calculating a Star’s Luminosity
The inverse-square law says that we can find a star’s luminosity
if we know its distance and its apparent brightness. To do this, it
is convenient to express this law in a somewhat different form.
We first rearrange the above equation:
L ⫽ 4␲d 2b
We then apply this equation to the Sun. That is, we write a
similar equation relating the Sun’s luminosity (L䉺), the distance
from the Earth to the Sun (d䉺, equal to 1 AU), and the Sun’s apparent brightness (b䉺):
L䉺 ⫽ 4␲d䉺2b䉺
If we take the ratio of these two equations, the unpleasant
factor of 4␲ drops out and we are left with the following:

Box 17-2 shows how to use the above equation to determine
the luminosity of the nearby star ␧ (epsilon) Eridani, the fifth
brightest star in the constellation Eridanus (named for a river in
Greek mythology). Parallax measurements indicate that ␧ Eridani
is 3.23 pc away, and photometry shows that the star appears only
6.73 ⫻ 10⫺13 as bright as the Sun; using the above equation, we
find that ␧ Eridani has only 0.30 times the luminosity of the Sun.

The Stellar Population
Calculations of this kind show that stars come in a wide variety
of different luminosities, with values that range from about
106 L䉺 (a million times the Sun’s luminosity) to only about
10⫺4 L䉺 (a mere ten-thousandth of the Sun’s light output). The
most luminous star emits roughly 1010 times more energy each
second than the least luminous! (To put this number in perspective, about 1010 human beings have lived on the Earth since our
species first evolved.)
As stars go, our Sun is neither extremely luminous nor extremely dim; it is a rather ordinary, garden-variety star. It is somewhat more luminous than most stars, however. Of more than
30 stars within 4 pc of the Sun (see Appendix 4), only three
(␣ Centauri, Sirius, and Procyon) have a greater luminosity than
the Sun.
To better characterize a typical population of stars, astronomers count the stars out to a certain distance from the Sun
and plot the number of stars that have different luminosities. The
resulting graph is called the luminosity function. Figure 17-5 on
page 440 shows the luminosity function for stars in our part of
the Milky Way Galaxy. The curve declines very steeply for the
most luminous stars toward the left side of the graph, indicating
that they are quite rare. For example, this graph shows that stars
like the Sun are about 10,000 times more common than stars like
Spica (which has a luminosity of 2100 L䉺).
The exact shape of the curve in Figure 17-5 applies only to
the vicinity of the Sun and similar regions in our Milky Way
Galaxy. Other locations have somewhat different luminosity functions. In stellar populations in general, however, low-luminosity
stars are much more common than high-luminosity ones.

Review: We can check our result by comparing with the

luminosity versus 0.30 times), but Pleione appears dimmer
than ␧ Eridani (3.19 ⫻ 10⫺13 times as bright as the Sun
compared to 6.73 ⫻ 10⫺13 times). For this to be true, Pleione
must be much farther away from Earth than is ␧ Eridani.

in Chapter 24 we will explore further how they are used to
determine the distances to remote galaxies.

17-3 Astronomers often use the magnitude
scale to denote brightness
Because astronomy is among the most ancient of sciences, some
of the tools used by modern astronomers are actually many centuries old. One such tool is the magnitude scale, which astronomers frequently use to denote the brightness of stars. This
scale was introduced in the second century B.C. by the Greek
astronomer Hipparchus, who called the brightest stars firstmagnitude stars. Stars about half as bright as first-magnitude
stars were called second-magnitude stars, and so forth, down to
sixth-magnitude stars, the dimmest ones he could see. After telescopes came into use, astronomers extended Hipparchus’s magnitude scale to include even dimmer stars.

The Luminosity Function This graph shows how many stars of a given
luminosity lie within a representative 1000 cubic-parsec volume. The
scale at the bottom of the graph shows absolute magnitude, an
alternative measure of a star’s luminosity (described in Section 17-3).

The magnitudes in Hipparchus’s scale are properly called apparent magnitudes, because they describe how bright an object appears to an Earth-based observer. Apparent magnitude is directly
related to apparent brightness.

CAUTION! The magnitude scale can be confusing because it
works “backward.” Keep in mind that the greater the apparent
magnitude, the dimmer the star. A star of apparent magnitude
⫹3 (a third-magnitude star) is dimmer than a star of apparent
magnitude ⫹2 (a second-magnitude star).

The Nature of the Stars

In the nineteenth century, astronomers developed better techniques for measuring the light energy arriving from a star. These
measurements showed that a first-magnitude star is about 100
times brighter than a sixth-magnitude star. In other words, it
would take 100 stars of magnitude ⫹6 to provide as much light
energy as we receive from a single star of magnitude ⫹1. To make
computations easier, the magnitude scale was redefined so that a
magnitude difference of 5 corresponds exactly to a factor of 100
in brightness. A magnitude difference of 1 corresponds to a factor of 2.512 in brightness, because

Thus, it takes 2.512 third-magnitude stars to provide as much
light as we receive from a single second-magnitude star.
Figure 17-6 illustrates the modern apparent magnitude scale.
The dimmest stars visible through a pair of binoculars have an
apparent magnitude of ⫹10, and the dimmest stars that can be
photographed in a one-hour exposure with the Keck telescopes
(see Section 6-2) or the Hubble Space Telescope have apparent
magnitude ⫹30. Modern astronomers also use negative numbers
to extend Hipparchus’s scale to include very bright objects. For
example, Sirius, the brightest star in the sky, has an apparent

Absolute Magnitudes
Apparent magnitude is a measure
of a star’s apparent brightness as
seen from Earth. A related quantity
that measures a star’s true energy
output—that is, its luminosity—is
called absolute magnitude. This is
the apparent magnitude a star
would have if it were located exactly 10 parsecs from Earth.

ANALOGY If you wanted to compare the light output of two
different lightbulbs, you would naturally place them side by side
so that both bulbs were the same distance from you. In the absolute magnitude scale, we imagine doing the same thing with
stars to compare their luminosities.
If the Sun were moved to a distance of 10 parsecs from the
Earth, it would have an apparent magnitude of ⫹4.8. The absolute magnitude of the Sun is thus ⫹4.8. The absolute magnitudes

of the stars range from approximately ⫹15 for the least luminous
to ⫺10 for the most luminous. (Note: Like apparent magnitudes,
absolute magnitudes work “backward”: The greater the absolute
magnitude, the less luminous the star.) The Sun’s absolute magnitude is about in the middle of this range.
We saw in Section 17-2 that we can calculate the luminosity
of a star if we know its distance and apparent brightness. There
is a mathematical relationship between absolute magnitude and
luminosity, which astronomers use to convert one to the other as
they see fit. It is also possible to rewrite the inverse-square law,
which we introduced in Section 17-2, as a mathematical relationship that allows you to calculate a star’s absolute magnitude (a
measure of its luminosity) from its distance and apparent magnitude (a measure of its apparent brightness). Box 17-3 describes
these relationships and how to use them.
Because the “backward” magnitude scales can be confusing,
we will use them only occasionally in this book. We will usually
speak of a star’s luminosity rather than its absolute magnitude
and will describe a star’s appearance in terms of apparent brightness rather than apparent magnitude. But if you go on to study
more about astronomy, you will undoubtedly make frequent use
of apparent magnitude and absolute magnitude.

17-4 A star’s color depends on its
surface temperature

Infrared

Color and Temperature
We saw in Section 5-3 that a star’s color is directly related to its
surface temperature. The intensity of light from a relatively cool
star peaks at long wavelengths, making the star look red (Figure
17-7a). A hot star’s intensity curve peaks at shorter wavelengths,
so the star looks blue (Figure 17-7c). For a star with an intermediate temperature, such as the Sun, the intensity peak is near the
middle of the visible spectrum. This gives the star a yellowish
color (Figure 17-7b). This leads to an important general rule
about star colors and surface temperatures:

Figure 17-7 shows that astronomers can accurately determine
the surface temperature of a star by carefully measuring its color.

it’s moving toward you. But for even the fastest stars, these
color shifts are so tiny that it takes sensitive instruments to
measure them. The red color of Betelgeuse and the blue color of
Bellatrix are not due to their motions; they are the actual colors
of the stars.

The image that opens this chapter shows that stars
come in different colors. You can see these colors even
with the naked eye. For example, you can easily see the

Apparent Magnitude and Absolute Magnitude
stronomers commonly express a star’s apparent brightness
in terms of apparent magnitude (denoted by a lowercase
A
m), and the star’s luminosity in terms of absolute magnitude
(denoted by a capital M). While we do not use these quantities
extensively in this book, it is useful to know a few simple relationships involving them.
Consider two stars, labeled 1 and 2, with apparent magnitudes m1 and m2 and brightnesses b1 and b2, respectively.
The ratio of their apparent brightnesses (b1/b2) corresponds to
a difference in their apparent magnitudes (m2 ⫺ m1). As we
learned in Section 17-3, each step in magnitude corresponds to
a factor of 2.512 in brightness; we receive 2.512 times more
energy per square meter per second from a third-magnitude
star than from a fourth-magnitude star. This idea was used to
construct the following table:

(2.512)10 ⫽ 104
(2.512)15 ⫽ 106
(2.512)20 ⫽ 108

Situation: In each case we want to find a ratio of two
apparent brightnesses (the brightness of Venus or Mercury
compared to that of the dimmest naked-eye stars).

Tools: In each case we will convert a difference in apparent
magnitude between the planet and the naked-eye star into a
ratio of their brightnesses.

Answer: The magnitude difference between Venus and the
dimmest stars visible to the naked eye is ⫹6 ⫺ (⫺4) ⫽ 10.
From the table, this difference corresponds to a brightness
ratio of (2.512)10 ⫽ 104 ⫽ 10,000, so Venus at it most
brilliant is 10,000 times brighter than the dimmest naked-eye
stars.
The magnitude difference between Mercury and the
dimmest naked-eye stars is ⫹4 ⫺ (⫺4) ⫽ 8. While this value
is not in the table, you can see that the corresponding ratio
of brightnesses is (2.512)8 ⫽ (2.512)5⫹3 ⫽ (2.512)5 ⫻
(2.512)3. From the table, (2.512)5 ⫽ 100 and (2.512)3 ⫽
15.85, so the ratio of brightnesses is 100 ⫻ 15.85 ⫽ 1585.
Hence, Mercury at its most brilliant is 1585 times brighter
than the dimmest stars visible to the naked eye.
Review: Can you show that when at their most brilliant,
Venus is 6.31 times brighter than Mercury? (Hint: No
multiplication or division is required—just notice the
difference in apparent magnitude between Venus and
Mercury, and consult the table.)

EXAMPLE:
A simple equation relates the difference between two stars’
apparent magnitudes to the ratio of their brightnesses:

The variable star RR Lyrae in the constellation
Lyra (the Harp) periodically doubles its light output. By how
much does its apparent magnitude change?

Situation: We are given a ratio of two brightnesses (the star

at its maximum is twice as bright as at its minimum). Our
goal is to find the corresponding difference in apparent
magnitude.

Tools: We let 1 denote the star at its maximum brightness
and 2 denote the same star at its dimmest, so the ratio
of brightnesses is b1/b2 ⫽ 2. We then use the equation
m2 ⫺ m1 ⫽ 2.5 log (b1/b2) to solve for the apparent
magnitude difference m2 ⫺ m1.
Answer: Using a calculator, we find m2 ⫺ m1 ⫽ 2.5 log (2) ⫽
2.5 ⫻ 0.30 ⫽ 0.75. RR Lyrae therefore varies periodically in
brightness by 0.75 magnitude.
Review: Our answer means that at its dimmest, RR Lyrae has
an apparent magnitude m2 that is 0.75 greater than its
apparent magnitude m1 when it is brightest. (Remember that
a greater value of apparent magnitude means the star is
dimmer, not brighter!)

Chapter 17

BOX 17-3 (continued)
The inverse-square law relating a star’s apparent brightness and luminosity can be rewritten in terms of the star’s apparent magnitude (m), absolute magnitude (M), and distance
from the Earth (d). This can be expressed as an equation:
Relation between a star’s apparent magnitude and absolute
magnitude
m ⫺ M ⫽ 5 log d ⫺ 5
m ⫽ star’s apparent magnitude
M ⫽ star’s absolute magnitude
d ⫽ distance from the Earth to the star in parsecs
In this expression m ⫺ M is called the distance modulus,
and log d means the logarithm of the distance d in parsecs. For
convenience, the following table gives the values of the distance d corresponding to different values of m ⫺ M.

This table shows that if a star is less than 10 pc away, its
distance modulus m ⫺ M is negative. That is, its apparent magnitude (m) is less than its absolute magnitude (M). If the star
is more than 10 pc away, m ⫺ M is positive and m is greater
than M. As an example, the star ␧ (epsilon) Indi, which is in
the direction of the southern constellation Indus, has apparent
magnitude m ⫽ ⫹4.7. It is 3.6 pc away, which is less than
10 pc, so its apparent magnitude is less than its absolute
magnitude.

EXAMPLE: Find the absolute magnitude of ␧ Indi.
Situation: We are given the distance to ␧ Indi (d ⫽ 3.6 pc)
and its apparent magnitude (m ⫽ ⫹4.7). Our goal is to find
the star’s absolute magnitude M.

Tools: We use the formula m ⫺ M ⫽ 5 log d ⫺ 5 to solve
for M.

Answer: Since d ⫽ 3.6 pc, we use a calculator to find log

d ⫽ log 3.6 ⫽ 0.56. Therefore the star’s distance modulus is
m ⫺ M ⫽ 5(0.56) ⫺ 5 ⫽ ⫺2.2, and the star’s absolute
magnitude is M ⫽ m ⫺ (⫺2.2) ⫽ ⫹4.7 ⫹ 2.2 ⫽ ⫹6.9.

Review: As a check on our calculations, note that this star’s
distance modulus m ⫺ M ⫽ ⫺2.2 is less than zero, as it
should be for a star less than 10 pc away. Note that our Sun
has absolute magnitude ⫹4.8; ␧ Indi has a greater absolute
magnitude, so it is less luminous than the Sun.

EXAMPLE: Suppose you were viewing the Sun from a planet
orbiting another star 100 pc away. Could you see it without
using a telescope?

Situation: We learned in the preceding examples that the Sun
has absolute magnitude M ⫽ ⫹4.8 and that the dimmest
stars visible to the naked eye have apparent magnitude
m ⫽ ⫹6. Our goal is to determine whether the Sun would
be visible to the naked eye at a distance of 100 pc.

Tools: We use the relationship m ⫺ M ⫽ 5 log d ⫺ 5 to find

the Sun’s apparent magnitude at d ⫽ 100 pc. If this is greater
than +6, the Sun would not be visible at that distance.
(Remember that the greater the apparent magnitude, the
dimmer the star.)

Answer: From the table, at d ⫽ 100 pc the distance modulus
is m ⫺ M ⫽ 5. So, as seen from this distant planet, the Sun’s
apparent magnitude would be m ⫽ M ⫹ 5 ⫽ ⫹4.8 ⫹ 5 ⫽
⫹9.8. This is greater than the naked-eye limit m ⫽ ⫹6, so
the Sun could not be seen.
Review: The Sun is by far the brightest object in the Earth’s
sky. But our result tells us that to an inhabitant of a
planetary system 100 pc away—a rather small distance in a
galaxy that is thousands of parsecs across—our own Sun
would be just another insignificant star, visible only through
a telescope.
The magnitude system is also used by astronomers to express the colors of stars as seen through different filters, as we
describe in Section 17-4. For example, rather than quantifying
a star’s color by the color ratio bV/bB (a star’s apparent brightness as seen through a V filter divided by the brightness through
a B filter), astronomers commonly use the color index B–V,
which is the difference in the star’s apparent magnitude as
measured with these two filters. We will not use this system in
this book, however (but see Advanced Questions 53 and 54).

U, B, and V Filters This graph shows the wavelengths to which the
standard filters are transparent. The U filter is transparent to nearultraviolet light. The B filter is transparent to violet, blue, and green light,
while the V filter is transparent to green and yellow light. By measuring
the apparent brightness of a star with each of these filters and
comparing the results, an astronomer can determine the star’s surface
temperature.

To do this, the star’s light is colAstronomers use a set of
lected by a telescope and passed
through one of a set of differently filters in their telescopes
colored filters. The filtered light is to measure the surface
then collected by a light-sensitive temperatures of stars
device such as a CCD (see Section
6-4). The process is then repeated
with each of the filters in the set. The star’s image will have a
different brightness through each colored filter, and by comparing these brightnesses astronomers can find the wavelength at
which the star’s intensity curve has its peak—and hence the star’s
temperature.

UBV Photometry
Let’s look at this procedure in more detail. The most commonly
used filters are called U, B, and V, and the technique that uses

445

them is called UBV photometry. Each filter is transparent in a different band of wavelengths: the ultraviolet (U), the blue (B), and
the yellow-green (V, for visual) region of the visible spectrum
(Figure 17-8). The transparency of the V filter mimics the sensitivity of the human eye.
To determine a star’s temperature using UBV photometry,
the astronomer first measures the star’s brightness through each
of the filters individually. This gives three apparent brightnesses
for the star, designated bU, bB, and bV. The astronomer then compares the intensity of starlight in neighboring wavelength bands
by taking the ratios of these brightnesses: bV/bB and bB /bU. Table
17-1 gives values for these color ratios for several stars with different surface temperatures.
If a star is very hot, its radiation is skewed toward short, ultraviolet wavelengths as in Figure 17-7c. This makes the star dim
through the V filter, brighter through the B filter, and brightest
through the U filter. Hence, for a hot star bV is less than bB,
which in turn is less than bU, and the ratios bV/bB and bB /bU are
both less than 1. One such star is Bellatrix (see Table 17-1), which
has a surface temperature of 21,500 K.
In contrast, if a star is cool, its radiation peaks at long wavelengths as in Figure 17-7a. Such a star appears brightest through
the V filter, dimmer through the B filter, and dimmest through
the U filter (see Figure 17-8). In other words, for a cool star bV
is greater than bB, which in turn is greater than bU. Hence, the ratios bV/bB and bB /bU will both be greater than 1. The star Betelgeuse (surface temperature 3500 K) is an example.
You can see these differences between hot and cool stars in
parts a and c of Figure 6-27, which show the constellation Orion
at ultraviolet wavelengths (a bit shorter than those transmitted by
the U filter) and at visible wavelengths that approximate the
transmission of a V filter. The hot star Bellatrix is brighter in the
ultraviolet image (Figure 6-27a) than at visible wavelengths
(Figure 6-27c). (Figure 6-27d shows the names of the stars.) The
situation is reversed for the cool star Betelgeuse: It is bright at visible wavelengths, but at ultraviolet wavelengths it is too dim to
show up in the image.
Figure 17-9 graphs the relationship between a star’s bV/bB
color ratio and its temperature. If you know the value of the
bV/bB color ratio for a given star, you can use this graph to find
the star’s surface temperature. As an example, for the Sun bV/bB

We see an absorption line spectrum when a cool gas lies between
us and a hot, glowing object (recall Figure 5-16). The light from
the hot, glowing object itself has a continuous spectrum. In the
case of a star, light with a continuous spectrum is produced at
low-lying levels of the star’s atmosphere where the gases are hot
and dense. The absorption lines are created when this light flows
outward through the upper layers of the star’s atmosphere. Atoms
in these cooler, less dense layers absorb radiation at specific wavelengths, which depend on the specific kinds of atoms present—
hydrogen, helium, or other elements—and on whether or not the
atoms are ionized. Absorption lines in the Sun’s spectrum are produced in this same way (see Section 16-5).

Color ratio bV/bB

Temperature, Color, and Color Ratio The b V/b B color ratio is the ratio
of a star’s apparent brightnesses through a V filter and through a B filter.

estimate the star’s surface temperature from a graph like this one.

equals 1.87, which corresponds to a surface temperature of
5800 K.

CAUTION! As we will see in Chapter 18, tiny dust particles
that pervade interstellar space cause distant stars to appear redder than they really are. (In the same way, particles in the Earth’s
atmosphere make the setting Sun look redder; see Box 5-4.) Astronomers must take this reddening into account whenever they
attempt to determine a star’s surface temperature from its color
ratios. A star’s spectrum provides a more precise measure of a
star’s surface temperature, as we will see next. But it is quicker
and easier to observe a star’s colors with a set of U, B, and V
filters than it is to take the star’s spectrum with a spectrograph.

17-5 The spectra of stars reveal their
chemical compositions as well as their
surface temperatures
We have seen how the color of a star’s light helps astronomers
determine its surface temperature. To determine the other properties of a star, astronomers must analyze the spectrum of its light
in more detail. This technique of stellar spectroscopy began in
1817 when Joseph Fraunhofer, a German instrument maker, attached a spectroscope to a telescope and pointed it toward the
stars. Fraunhofer had earlier observed that the Sun has an absorption line spectrum—that is, a continuous spectrum with dark absorption lines (see Section 5-6). He found that stars have the same
kind of spectra, which reinforces the idea that our Sun is a rather
typical star. But Fraunhofer also found that the pattern of absorption lines is different for different stars.

WE

Some stars have spectra in which the Balmer absorption lines of hydrogen are prominent. But in the spectra of other stars, including the Sun, the Balmer lines
are nearly absent and the dominant absorption lines are those of
heavier elements such as calcium, iron, and sodium. Still other
stellar spectra are dominated by broad absorption lines caused by
molecules, such as titanium oxide, rather than single atoms. To
cope with this diversity, astronomers group similar-appearing
stellar spectra into spectral classes. In a popular classification
scheme that emerged in the late 1890s, a star was assigned a letter from A through O according to the strength or weakness of
the hydrogen Balmer lines in the star’s spectrum.
Nineteenth-century science could not explain why or how the
spectral lines of a particular chemical are affected by the temperature and density of the gas. Nevertheless, a team of astronomers
at the Harvard College Observatory forged ahead with a monumental project of examining the
spectra of hundreds of thousands of Deciphering the
stars. Their goal was to develop a information in starlight
system of spectral classification in took the painstaking
which all spectral features, not just work of generations of
Balmer lines, change smoothly from
astronomers
one spectral class to the next.
The Harvard project was financed by the estate of Henry
Draper, a wealthy New York physician and amateur astronomer
who in 1872 became the first person to photograph stellar absorption lines. Researchers on the project included Edward C.
Pickering, Williamina Fleming, Antonia Maury, and Annie Jump
Cannon (Figure 17-10). As a result of their efforts, many of the
original A-through-O classes were dropped and others were consolidated. The remaining spectral classes were reordered in the sequence OBAFGKM. You can remember this sequence with the
mnemonic: “Oh, Be A Fine Girl (or Guy), Kiss Me!”

Refining the Classification: Spectral Types
Cannon refined the original OBAFGKM sequence into smaller
steps called spectral types. These steps are indicated by attaching
an integer from 0 through 9 to the original letter. For example,
the spectral class F includes spectral types F0, F1, F2, . . . , F8,
F9, which are followed by the spectral types G0, G1, G2, . . . ,

Classifying the Spectra of the Stars The modern scheme
of classifying stars by their spectra was developed at the
Harvard College Observatory in the late nineteenth century. A team of

of the time prevented most women astronomers from using research
telescopes or receiving salaries comparable to men’s. (Harvard College

Every other type of atom or molecule also has a characteristic temperature range in which it produces
prominent absorption lines in the observable part of
the spectrum. Figure 17-12 shows the relative strengths of absorption lines produced by different chemicals. By measuring the details of these lines in a given star’s spectrum, astronomers can
accurately determine that star’s surface temperature.
For example, the spectral lines of neutral (that is, un-ionized)
helium are strong around 25,000 K. At this temperature, photons
have enough energy to excite helium atoms without tearing away
the electrons altogether. In stars hotter than about 30,000 K, helium atoms become singly ionized, that is, they lose one of their
two electrons. The remaining electron produces a set of spectral
lines that is recognizably different from those of neutral helium.
Hence, when the spectral lines of singly ionized helium appear in
a star’s spectrum, we know that the star’s surface temperature is
greater than 30,000 K.
Astronomers use the term metals to refer to all elements other
than hydrogen and helium. (This idiosyncratic use of the term
“metal” is quite different from the definition used by chemists
and other scientists. To a chemist, sodium and iron are metals but
carbon and oxygen are not; to an astronomer, all of these substances are metals.) In this terminology, metals dominate the

Figure 17-11 shows representative spectra of several spectral
types. The strengths of spectral lines change gradually from one
spectral type to the next. For example, the Balmer absorption
lines of hydrogen become increasingly prominent as you go from
spectral type B0 to A0. From A0 onward through the F and G
classes, the hydrogen lines weaken and almost fade from view.
The Sun, whose spectrum is dominated by calcium and iron, is a
G2 star.
The Harvard project culminated in the Henry Draper Catalogue, published between 1918 and 1924. It listed 225,300 stars,
each of which Cannon had personally classified. Meanwhile,
physicists had been making important discoveries about the structure of atoms. Ernest Rutherford had shown that atoms have nuclei (recall Figure 5-19), and Niels Bohr made the remarkable
hypothesis that electrons circle atomic nuclei along discrete orbits
(see Figure 5-22). These advances gave scientists the conceptual
and mathematical tools needed to understand stellar spectra.
In the 1920s, the Harvard astronomer Cecilia Payne and the
Indian physicist Meghnad Saha demonstrated that the OBAFGKM
spectral sequence is actually a sequence in temperature. The hottest
stars are O stars. Their absorption lines can occur only if these
stars have surface temperatures above 25,000 K. M stars are the
coolest stars. The spectral features of M stars are consistent with
stellar surface temperatures of about 3000 K.

To see why the appearance of a star’s spectrum is profoundly affected by the star’s surface temperature, consider the Balmer lines
of hydrogen. Hydrogen is by far the most abundant element in
the universe, accounting for about three-quarters of the mass of
a typical star. Yet the Balmer lines do not necessarily show up in
a star’s spectrum. As we saw in Section 5-8, Balmer absorption
lines are produced when an electron in the n ⫽ 2 orbit of hydrogen is lifted into a higher orbit by absorbing a photon with the
right amount of energy (see Figure 5-24). If the star is much hotter than 10,000 K, the photons pouring out of the star’s interior
have such high energy that they easily knock electrons out of hydrogen atoms in the star’s atmosphere. This process ionizes the
gas. With its only electron torn away, a hydrogen atom cannot
produce absorption lines. Hence, the Balmer lines will be relatively weak in the spectra of such hot stars, such as the hot O and
B2 stars in Figure 17-11.
Conversely, if the star’s atmosphere is much cooler than
10,000 K, almost all the hydrogen atoms are in the lowest
(n ⫽ 1) energy state. Most of the photons passing through the
star’s atmosphere possess too little energy to boost electrons up
from the n ⫽ 1 to the n ⫽ 2 orbit of the hydrogen atoms. Hence,
very few of these atoms will have electrons in the n ⫽ 2 orbit, and
only these few can absorb the photons characteristic of the Balmer
lines. As a result, these lines are nearly absent from the spectrum
of a cool star. (You can see this in the spectra of the cool M0 and
M2 stars in Figure 17-11.)
For the Balmer lines to be prominent in a star’s spectrum, the
star must be hot enough to excite the electrons out of the ground
state but not so hot that all the hydrogen atoms become ionized.
A stellar surface temperature of about 9000 K produces the
strongest hydrogen lines; this is the case for the stars of spectral
types A0 and A5 in Figure 17-11.

Principal Types of Stellar Spectra Stars of different spectral classes
and different surface temperatures have spectra dominated by different
absorption lines. Notice how the Balmer lines of hydrogen (H␣, H␤, H␥, and
H␦) are strongest for hot stars of spectral class A, while absorption lines
due to calcium (Ca) are strongest in cooler K and M stars. The spectra of
M stars also have broad, dark bands caused by molecules of titanium

oxide (TiO), which can only exist at relatively low temperatures. A roman
numeral after a chemical symbol shows whether the absorption line is
caused by un-ionized atoms (roman numeral I) or by atoms that have
lost one electron (roman numeral II). (R. Bell, University of Maryland, and
M. Briley, University of Wisconsin at Oshkosh)

neutral metals are strongest between approximately 5500 and
4000 K.
Below 4000 K, certain atoms in a star’s atmosphere combine
to form molecules. (At higher temperatures atoms move so fast
that when they collide, they bounce off each other rather than
“sticking together” to form molecules.) As these molecules vibrate
and rotate, they produce bands of spectral lines that dominate
the star’s spectrum. Most noticeable are the lines of titanium oxide (TiO), which are strongest for surface temperatures of about
3000 K.

Since 1995 astronomers have found a number of stars
with surface temperatures even lower than those of
spectral class M. Strictly speaking, these are not stars
but brown dwarfs, which we introduced in Section 8-6. Brown
dwarfs are too small to sustain thermonuclear fusion in their
cores. Instead, these “substars” glow primarily from the heat released by Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction, which we described in
Section 16-1. (They do undergo fusion reactions for a brief period
during their evolution.) Brown dwarfs are so cold that they are
best observed with infrared telescopes (see Figure 17-13). Such
observations reveal that brown dwarf spectra have a rich variety
of absorption lines due to molecules. Some of these molecules actually form into solid grains in a brown dwarf’s atmosphere.
To describe brown dwarf spectra, astronomers have defined
two new spectral classes, L and T. Thus, the modern spectral sequence of stars and brown dwarfs from hottest to coldest surface
temperature is OBAFGKMLT. (Can you think of a new mnemonic
that includes L and T?) For example, Figure 17-13 shows a star
of spectral class K and a brown dwarf of spectral class T. Table
17-2 summarizes the relationship between the temperature and
spectra of stars and brown dwarfs.

is orbited by a brown dwarf named HD 3651B with a surface temperature

The brown dwarf emits most of its light at infrared wavelengths, so an
infrared telescope was used to record this image. The hotter and more
luminous star HD 3651 is greatly overexposed in this image and appears
much larger than its true size. HD 3651 and HD 3651B are both 11 pc

Chapter 17

When the effects of temperature are accounted for, astronomers find that all stars have essentially the same chemical
composition. We can state the results as a general rule:
By mass, almost all stars (including the Sun) and brown
dwarfs are about three-quarters hydrogen, one-quarter helium,
and 1% or less metals.
Our Sun is about 1% metals by mass, as are most of the stars you
can see with the naked eye. But some stars have an even lower
percentage of metals. We will see in Chapter 19 that these seemingly minor differences tell an important tale about the life stories of stars.

17-6 Stars come in a wide variety of sizes
With even the best telescopes, stars appear as nothing more than
bright points of light. On a photograph or CCD image, brighter stars A star’s radius can be
appear larger than dim ones (see calculated if we know its
Figures 17-3, 17-6b, and 17-13), but luminosity and surface
these apparent sizes give no indicatemperature
tion of the star’s actual size. To de-

termine the size of a star, astronomers combine information about
its luminosity (determined from its distance and apparent brightness) and its surface temperature (determined from its spectral
type). In this way, they find that some stars are quite a bit smaller
than the Sun, while others are a thousand times larger.

Calculating the Radii of Stars
The key to finding a star’s radius from its luminosity and surface
temperature is the Stefan-Boltzmann law (see Section 5-4). This
law says that the amount of energy radiated per second from a
square meter of a blackbody’s surface—that is, the energy flux
(F)—is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature of
that surface (T ), as given by the equation F ⫽ ␴T 4. This equation
applies very well to stars, whose spectra are quite similar to that
of a perfect blackbody. (Absorption lines, while important for determining the star’s chemical composition and surface temperature, make only relatively small modifications to a star’s blackbody
spectrum.)
A star’s luminosity is the amount of energy emitted per second from its entire surface. This equals the energy flux F multiplied by the total number of square meters on the star’s surface
(that is, the star’s surface area). We expect that most stars are
nearly spherical, like the Sun, so we can use the formula for the
surface area of a sphere. This is 4␲R2, where R is the star’s

BOX 17-4

Tools of the Astronomer’s Trade

Stellar Radii, Luminosities, and Surface Temperatures
ecause stars emit light in almost exactly the same fashion
as blackbodies, we can use the Stefan-Boltzmann law to reB
late a star’s luminosity (L), surface temperature (T), and radius (R). The relevant equation is

many calculations, it is more convenient to relate everything to
the Sun, which is a typical star. Specifically, for the Sun we
have L䉺 ⫽ 4␲R䉺2␴T䉺4, where L䉺 is the Sun’s luminosity, R䉺
is the Sun’s radius, and T䉺 is the Sun’s surface temperature
(equal to 5800 K). Dividing the general equation for L by this
specific equation for the Sun, we obtain

This is an easier formula to use because the constant ␴ has
cancelled out. We can also rearrange terms to arrive at a useful equation for the radius (R) of a star:

constellation Orion (see Figure 2-2 or Figure 6-30c) is
60,000 times more luminous than the Sun and has a surface
temperature of 3500 K. What is its radius?

Situation: We are given the star’s luminosity L ⫽ 60,000 L䉺
and its surface temperature T ⫽ 3500 K. Our goal is to find
the star’s radius R.

The Nature of the Stars

radius (the distance from its center to its surface). Multiplying together the formulas for energy flux and surface area, we can write
the star’s luminosity as follows:
Relationship between a star’s luminosity, radius, and surface
temperature
L ⫽ 4␲R2␴T 4
L ⫽ star’s luminosity, in watts
R ⫽ star’s radius, in meters
␴ ⫽ Stefan-Boltzmann constant ⫽ 5.67 ⫻ 10⫺8 W m⫺2 K⫺4
T ⫽ star’s surface temperature, in kelvins
This equation says that a relatively cool star (low surface
temperature T ), for which the energy flux is quite low, can
nonetheless be very luminous if it has a large enough radius R.
Alternatively, a relatively hot star (large T) can have a very low
luminosity if the star has only a little surface area (small R).
Box 17-4 describes how to use the above equation to calculate a star’s radius if its luminosity and surface temperature are
known. We can express the idea behind these calculations in
terms of the following general rule:

Tools: We use the above equation to find the ratio of the
star’s radius to the radius of the Sun, R/R䉺. Note that we
also know the Sun’s surface temperature, T䉺 ⫽ 5800 K.
Answer: Substituting these data into the above equation, we
get

451

We can determine the radius of a star from its luminosity and
surface temperature. For a given luminosity, the greater the
surface temperature, the smaller the radius must be. For a
given surface temperature, the greater the luminosity, the larger
the radius must be.

ANALOGY In a similar way, a roaring campfire can emit more
light than a welder’s torch. The campfire is at a lower temperature than the torch, but has a much larger surface area from
which it emits light.

The Range of Stellar Radii
Using this general rule as shown in Box 17-4, astronomers find
that stars come in a wide range of sizes. The smallest stars visible
through ordinary telescopes, called white dwarfs, are about the
same size as the Earth. Although their surface temperatures can
be very high (25,000 K or more), white dwarfs have so little surface area that their luminosities are very low (less than 0.01 L䉺).
The largest stars, called supergiants, are a thousand times larger
in radius than the Sun and 105 times larger than white dwarfs. If
our own Sun were replaced by one of these supergiants, the Earth’s
orbit would lie completely inside the star!
Figure 17-14 summarizes how astronomers determine the
distance from Earth, luminosity, surface temperature, chemical

Situation: Again we are asked to find a star’s radius from its
luminosity and surface temperature.

Tools: We use the same equation as in the preceding
example.

Review: Our result tells us that Betelgeuse’s radius is 670
times larger than that of the Sun. The Sun’s radius is 6.96 ⫻
105 km, so we can also express the radius of Betelgeuse as
(670)(6.96 ⫻ 105 km) ⫽ 4.7 ⫻ 108 km. This is more than
3 AU. If Betelgeuse were located at the center of our solar
system, it would extend beyond the orbit of Mars!

EXAMPLE: Sirius, the brightest star in the sky, is actually two
stars orbiting each other (a binary star). The less luminous
star, Sirius B, is a white dwarf that is too dim to see with the
naked eye. Its luminosity is 0.0025 L䉺 and its surface
temperature is 10,000 K. How large is Sirius B compared to
the Earth?

Table 7-1, the Earth’s radius (half its diameter) is 6378 km.
Hence, this star is only about twice the radius of the Earth.

Review: Sirius B’s radius would be large for a terrestrial
planet, but it is minuscule for a star. The name dwarf is well
deserved!
The radii of some stars have been measured with other
techniques (see Section 17-11). These other methods yield values consistent with those calculated by the methods we have
just described.

17-7 Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) diagrams
reveal the different kinds of stars
Astronomers have collected a wealth of data about the stars, but
merely having tables of numerical data is not enough. Like all scientists, astronomers want to analyze their data to look for trends
and underlying principles. One of the best ways to look for trends
in any set of data, whether it comes from astronomy, finance,
medicine, or meteorology, is to create a graph showing how one
quantity depends on another. For example, investors consult
graphs of stock market values versus dates, and weather forecasters make graphs of temperature versus altitude to determine
whether thunderstorms will form. Astronomers have found that
a particular graph of stellar properties shows that stars fall naturally into just a few categories. This graph, one of the most important in all astronomy, will in later chapters help us understand
how stars form, evolve, and eventually die.

H-R Diagrams
Which properties of stars should we include in a graph? Most
stars have about the same chemical composition, but two properties of stars—their luminosities and surface temperatures—
differ substantially from one star to another. Stars also come in a
wide range of radii, but a star’s radius is a secondary property
that can be found from the luminosity and surface temperature

(as we saw in Section 17-6 and
A graph of luminosity
Box 17-4). We also relegate the positions and space velocities of stars versus surface
to secondary importance. (In a sim- temperature reveals that
ilar way, a physician is more inter- stars fall into a few basic
ested in your weight and blood categories
pressure than in where you live or
how fast you drive.) We can then
ask the following question: What do we learn when we graph the
luminosities of stars versus their surface temperatures?
The first answer to this question was given in 1911 by the
Danish astronomer Ejnar Hertzsprung. He pointed out that a regular pattern appears when the absolute magnitudes of stars (which
measure their luminosities) are plotted against their colors (which
measure their surface temperatures). Two years later, the American astronomer Henry Norris Russell independently discovered a
similar regularity in a graph using spectral types (another measure
of surface temperature) instead of colors. In recognition of their
originators, graphs of this kind are today known as HertzsprungRussell diagrams, or H-R diagrams (Figure 17-15).
Figure 17-15a is a typical Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. Each
dot represents a star whose spectral type and luminosity have
been determined. The most luminous stars are near the top of the
diagram, the least luminous stars near the bottom. Hot stars of
spectral classes O and B are toward the left side of the graph and
cool stars of spectral class M are toward the right.

CAUTION! You are probably accustomed to graphs in which
the numbers on the horizontal axis increase as you move to the
right. (For example, the business section of a newspaper includes a graph of stock market values versus dates, with later

the luminosities (or absolute magnitudes) of stars are plotted
against their spectral types (or surface temperatures). (a) The data points
are grouped in just a few regions on the graph, showing that luminosity
and spectral type are correlated. Most stars lie along the red curve called
the main sequence. Giants like Arcturus as well as supergiants like Rigel
and Betelgeuse are above the main sequence, and white dwarfs like

dates to the right of earlier ones.) But on an H-R diagram
the temperature scale on the horizontal axis increases toward
the left. This practice stems from the original diagrams of
Hertzsprung and Russell, who placed hot O stars on the left and
cool M stars on the right. This arrangement is a tradition that
no one has seriously tried to change.

Star Varieties: Main-Sequence Stars, Giants,
Supergiants, White Dwarfs, and Brown Dwarfs
The most striking feature of the H-R diagram is that the data
points are not scattered randomly over the graph but are grouped
in a few distinct regions. The luminosities and surface temperatures of stars do not have random values; instead, these two quantities are related!

Sirius B are below it. (b) The blue curves on this H-R diagram enclose the
regions of the diagram in which different types of stars are found. The
dashed diagonal lines indicate different stellar radii. For a given stellar
radius, as the surface temperature increases (that is, moving from right
to left in the diagram), the star glows more intensely and the luminosity
increases (that is, moving upward in the diagram). Note that the Sun is
intermediate in luminosity, surface temperature, and radius.

The band stretching diagonally across the H-R diagram includes about 90% of the stars in the night sky. This band, called
the main sequence, extends from the hot, luminous, blue stars in
the upper left corner of the diagram to the cool, dim, red stars in
the lower right corner. A star whose properties place it in this region of an H-R diagram is called a main-sequence star. The Sun
(spectral type G2, luminosity 1 L䉺, absolute magnitude ⫹4.8) is
such a star. We will find that all main-sequence stars are like the
Sun in that hydrogen fusion—thermonuclear reactions that convert hydrogen into helium (see Section 16-1)—is taking place in
their cores.
The upper right side of the H-R diagram shows a second major grouping of data points. Stars represented by these points are
both luminous and cool. From the Stefan-Boltzmann law, we

Chapter 17

know that a cool star radiates much less light per unit of surface
area than a hot star. In order for these stars to be as luminous as
they are, they must be huge (see Section 17-6), and so they are
called giants. These stars are around 10 to 100 times larger than
the Sun. You can see this in Figure 17-15b, which is an H-R diagram to which dashed lines have been added to represent stellar
radii. Most giant stars are around 100 to 1000 times more luminous than the Sun and have surface temperatures of about 3000
to 6000 K. Cooler members of this class of stars (those with surface temperatures from about 3000 to 4000 K) are often called
red giants because they appear reddish. The bright yellowish stars
in the image that opens this chapter are red giants. (Notice how
they outshine the blue stars in this image, which are at the same
distance from Earth as the red giants but are smaller and less luminous.) A number of red giants can easily be seen with the naked
eye, including Aldebaran in the constellation Taurus and Arcturus
in Boötes.
A few rare stars are considerably bigger and brighter than
typical red giants, with radii up to 1000 R䉺. Appropriately
enough, these superluminous stars are called supergiants. Betelgeuse in Orion (see Box 17-4) and Antares in Scorpius are two
supergiants you can find in the nighttime sky. Together, giants
and supergiants make up about 1% of the stars in the sky.
Both giants and supergiants have thermonuclear reactions occurring in their interiors, but the character of those reactions and
where in the star they occur can be quite different than for a
main-sequence star like the Sun. We will study these stars in more
detail in Chapters 21 and 22.
The remaining 9% of stars form a distinct grouping of data
points toward the lower left corner of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. Although these stars are hot, their luminosities are quite
low; hence, they must be small. They are appropriately called
white dwarfs. These stars, which are so dim that they can be seen
only with a telescope, are approximately the same size as the
Earth. As we will learn in Chapter 22, no thermonuclear reactions
take place within white dwarf stars. Rather, like embers left from
a fire, they are the still-glowing remnants of what were once giant stars.
By contrast, brown dwarfs (which lie at the extreme lower
right of the main sequence, off the bottom and right-hand edge
of Figure 17-15a or Figure 17-15b) are objects that will never become stars. They are comparable in radius to the planet Jupiter
(that is, intermediate in size between the Earth and the Sun; see
Figure 7-2). The study of brown dwarfs is still in its infancy, but
it appears that there may be twice as many brown dwarfs as there
are “real” stars.

ANALOGY You can think of white dwarfs as “has-been” stars
whose days of glory have passed. In this analogy, a brown dwarf
is a “never-will-be.”
The existence of fundamentally different types of stars is the
first important lesson to come from the H-R diagram. In later
chapters we will find that these different types represent various
stages in the lives of stars. We will use the H-R diagram as an essential tool for understanding how stars evolve.

17-8 Details of a star’s spectrum reveal
whether it is a giant, a white dwarf, or a
main-sequence star
A star’s surface temperature largely determines which lines are
prominent in its spectrum. Therefore, classifying stars by spectral
type is essentially the same as categorizing them by surface temperature. But as the H-R diagram in Figure 17-15b shows, stars
of the same surface temperature can have very different luminosities. As an example, a star with surface temperature 5800 K could
be a white dwarf, a main-sequence star, a giant, or a supergiant,
depending on its luminosity. By examining the details of a star’s
spectrum, however, astronomers can determine to which of these
categories a star belongs. This gives astronomers a tool to determine the distances to stars millions of parsecs away, far beyond the
maximum distance that can be measured using stellar parallax.

Determining a Star’s Size from Its Spectrum
Figure 17-16 compares the spectra of two stars of the same spectral type but different luminosity (and hence different size): a B8
supergiant and a B8 main-sequence star. Note that the Balmer
lines of hydrogen are narrow in the spectrum of the very large,

A star’s spectral type and luminosity class, combined with the information on the H-R diagram, enable astronomers to estimate
the star’s distance from the Earth. As an example, consider the
star Pleione in the constellation Taurus. Its spectrum reveals
Pleione to be a B8 V star (a hot, blue, main-sequence star, like the
one in Figure 17-16b). Using Figure 17-17, we can read off that
such a star’s luminosity is 190 L䉺. Given the star’s luminosity and
its apparent brightness—in the case of Pleione, 3.9 ⫻ 10⫺13 of the
apparent brightness of the Sun—we can use the inverse-square

Luminosity Classes
In the 1930s, W. W. Morgan and P. C. Keenan of the Yerkes Observatory of the University of Chicago developed a system of luminosity classes based upon the subtle differences in spectral
lines. When these luminosity classes are plotted on an H-R diagram (Figure 17-17), they provide a useful subdivision of the star
types in the upper right of the diagram. Luminosity classes Ia and
Ib are composed of supergiants; luminosity class V includes all the
main-sequence stars. The intermediate classes distinguish giant
stars of various luminosities. Note that for stars of a given surface temperature (that is, a given spectral type), the higher the
number of the luminosity class, the lower the star’s luminosity.
As we will see in Chapters 19 and 20, different luminosity
classes represent different stages in the evolution of a star. White
dwarfs are not given a luminosity class of their own; as we mentioned in Section 17-7, they represent a final stage in stellar evolution in which no thermonuclear reactions take place.
Astronomers commonly use a shorthand description that
combines a star’s spectral type and its luminosity class. For example, the Sun is said to be a G2 V star. The spectral type indicates
the star’s surface temperature, and the luminosity class indicates
its luminosity. Thus, an astronomer knows immediately that any
G2 V star is a main-sequence star with a luminosity of about
1 L䉺 and a surface temperature of about 5800 K. Similarly, a description of Aldebaran as a K5 III star tells an astronomer that it
is a red giant with a luminosity of around 370 L䉺 and a surface
temperature of about 4000 K.

Luminosity (L )

Fundamentally, these differences between stars of different
luminosity are due to differences between the stars’ atmospheres,
where absorption lines are produced. Hydrogen lines in particular are affected by the density and pressure of the gas in a star’s
atmosphere. The higher the density and pressure, the more frequently hydrogen atoms collide and interact with other atoms and
ions in the atmosphere. These collisions shift the energy levels in
the hydrogen atoms and thus broaden the hydrogen spectral lines.
In the atmosphere of a luminous giant star, the density and
pressure are quite low because the star’s mass is spread over a
huge volume. Atoms and ions in the atmosphere are relatively far
apart; hence, collisions between them are sufficiently infrequent
that hydrogen atoms can produce narrow Balmer lines. A mainsequence star, however, is much more compact than a giant or supergiant. In the denser atmosphere of a main-sequence star,
frequent interatomic collisions perturb the energy levels in the hydrogen atoms, thereby producing broader Balmer lines.

Luminosity Classes The H-R diagram is divided into regions

law to determine its distance from the Earth. The mathematical
details are worked out in Box 17-2.
This method for determining distance, in which the luminosity of a star is found using spectroscopy, is called spectroscopic
parallax. Figure 17-18 summarizes the method of spectroscopic
parallax.

CAUTION! The name “spectroscopic parallax” is a bit misleading, because no parallax angle is involved! The idea is that measuring the star’s spectrum takes the place of measuring its
parallax as a way to find the star’s distance. A better name for
this method, although not the one used by astronomers, would
be “spectroscopic distance determination.”
Spectroscopic parallax is an incredibly powerful technique.
No matter how remote a star is, this technique allows astronomers

far away, its parallax angle is too small to allow a direct
determination of its distance. This flowchart shows how
astronomers deduce the properties of such a distant star. Note
that the H-R diagram plays a central role in determining the
star’s luminosity from its spectral type and luminosity class.
Just as for nearby stars (see Figure 17-14), the star’s chemical
composition is determined from its spectrum, and the star’s
radius is calculated from the luminosity and surface
temperature.

to determine its distance, provided only that its spectrum and apparent brightness can be measured. Box 17-2 gives an example of
how spectroscopic parallax has been used to find the distance to
stars in other galaxies tens of millions of parsecs away. By contrast, we saw in Section 17-1 that “real” stellar parallaxes can be
measured only for stars within a few hundred parsecs.
Unfortunately, spectroscopic parallax has its limitations; distances to individual stars determined using this method are only
accurate to at best 10%. The reason is that the luminosity classes
shown in Figure 17-17 are not thin lines on the H-R diagram but
are moderately broad bands. Hence, even if a star’s spectral type
and luminosity class are known, there is still some uncertainty in
the luminosity that we read off an H-R diagram. Nonetheless,
spectroscopic parallax is often the only means that an astronomer
has to estimate the distance to remote stars.
What has been left out of this discussion is why different
stars have different spectral types and luminosities. One key factor, as we shall see, turns out to be the mass of the star.

17-9 Observing binary star systems reveals
the masses of stars
We now know something about the sizes, temperatures, and luminosities of stars. To complete our picture of the physical properties of stars, we need to know their masses. In this section, we
will see that stars come in a wide range of masses. We will also

discover an important relationship
For main-sequence stars,
between the mass and luminosity of
main-sequence stars. This relation- there is a direct
ship is crucial to understanding why correlation between mass
some main-sequence stars are hot and luminosity
and luminous, while others are cool
and dim. It will also help us understand what happens to a star as it ages and evolves.
Determining the masses of stars is not trivial, however. The
problem is that there is no practical, direct way to measure the
mass of an isolated star. Fortunately for astronomers, about half
of the visible stars in the night sky are not isolated individuals.
Instead, they are multiple-star systems, in which two or more
stars orbit each other. By carefully observing the motions of these
stars, astronomers can glean important information about their
masses.

Binary Stars
A pair of stars located at nearly the same position in the night sky
is called a double star. The Anglo-German astronomer William
Herschel made the first organized search for such pairs. Between
1782 and 1821, he published three catalogs listing more than 800
double stars. Late in the nineteenth century, his son, John
Herschel, discovered 10,000 more doubles. Some of these double
stars are optical double stars, which are two stars that lie along
nearly the same line of sight but are actually at very different distances from us. But many double stars are true binary stars, or

A Binary Star System As seen from Earth, the two stars that make up
the binary system called 2MASSW J0746425⫹2000321 are separated by
less than 1/3 arcsecond. The images surrounding the center diagram
show the relative positions of the two stars over a four-year period. These
images were made by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), the European

binaries—pairs of stars that actually orbit each other. Figure
17-19 shows an example of this orbital motion.
When astronomers can actually see the two stars orbiting
each other, a binary is called a visual binary. By observing the binary over an extended period, astronomers can plot the orbit that
one star appears to describe around the other, as shown in the
center diagram in Figure 17-19.
In fact, both stars in a binary system are in motion: They orbit each other because of their mutual gravitational attraction,
and their orbital motions obey Kepler’s third law as formulated
by Isaac Newton (see Section 4-7 and Box 4-4). This law can be
written as follows:

Here a is the semimajor axis of the elliptical orbit that one
star appears to describe around the other, plotted as in the center diagram in Figure 17-19. As this equation indicates, if we can
measure this semimajor axis (a) and the orbital period (P), we can
learn something about the masses of the two stars.
In principle, the orbital period of a visual binary is easy to
determine. All you have to do is see how long it takes for the two
stars to revolve once about each other. The two stars shown in
Figure 17-19 are relatively close, about 2.5 AU on average, and
their orbital period is only 10 years. Many binary systems have

thus never collide.

much larger separations, however, and the period may be so long
that more than one astronomer’s lifetime is needed to complete
the observations.
Determining the semimajor axis of an orbit can also be a
challenge. The angular separation between the stars can be determined by observation. To convert this angle into a physical distance between the stars, we need to know the distance between
the binary and the Earth. This can be found from parallax measurements or by using spectroscopic parallax. The astronomer
must also take into account how the orbit is tilted to our line of
sight.
Once both P and a have been determined, Kepler’s third law
can be used to calculate M1 ⫹ M2, the sum of the masses of the
two stars in the binary system. But this analysis tells us nothing
about the individual masses of the two stars. To obtain these,
more information about the motions of the two stars is needed.
Each of the two stars in a binary system actually moves in an
elliptical orbit about the center of mass of the system. Imagine
two children sitting on opposite ends of a seesaw (Figure 17-20a).
For the seesaw to balance properly, they must position themselves
so that their center of mass—an imaginary point that lies along a
line connecting their two bodies—is at the fulcrum, or pivot point
of the seesaw. If the two children have the same mass, the center
of mass lies midway between them, and they should sit equal distances from the fulcrum. If their masses are different, the center
of mass is closer to the heavier child.
Just as the seesaw naturally balances at its center of mass, the
two stars that make up a binary system naturally orbit around
their center of mass (Figure 17-20b). The center of mass always
lies along the line connecting the two stars and is closer to the
more massive star.
The center of mass of a visual binary is located by plotting
the separate orbits of the two stars, as in Figure 17-20b, using the
background stars as reference points. The center of mass lies at

the common focus of the two elliptical orbits. Comparing the relative sizes of the two orbits around the center of mass yields the
ratio of the two stars’ masses, M1/M2. The sum M1 ⫹ M2 is already known from Kepler’s third law, so the individual masses of
the two stars can then be determined.

Main-Sequence Masses and
the Mass-Luminosity Relation
Years of careful, patient observations of binaries have slowly
yielded the masses of many stars. As the data accumulated, an important trend began to emerge: For main-sequence stars, there is
a direct correlation between mass and luminosity. The more massive a main-sequence star, the more luminous it is. Figure 17-21
depicts this mass-luminosity relation as a graph. The range of stellar masses extends from less than 0.1 of a solar mass to more than
50 solar masses. The Sun’s mass lies between these extremes.
The Cosmic Connections figure on the next page depicts the
mass-luminosity relation for main-sequence stars on an H-R diagram. This figure shows the main sequence on an H-R diagram
is a progression in mass as well as in luminosity and surface temperature. The hot, bright, bluish stars in the upper left corner of
an H-R diagram are the most massive main-sequence stars. Likewise, the dim, cool, reddish stars in the lower right corner of an
H-R diagram are the least massive. Main-sequence stars of intermediate temperature and luminosity also have intermediate
masses.
The mass of a main-sequence star also helps determine its radius. Referring back to Figure 17-15b, we see that if we go along
the main sequence from low luminosity to high luminosity, the radius of the star increases. Thus, we have the following general
rule for main-sequence stars:
The greater the mass of a main-sequence star, the greater its
luminosity, its surface temperature, and its radius.

The main sequence is an arrangement of stars according to their
mass. The most massive main-sequence stars have the greatest
luminosity, greatest radius, and greatest surface temperature. This
is a consequence of the behavior of thermonuclear reactions at
the core of a main-sequence star.

Each dot represents a
main-sequence star. The
number next to each dot
is the mass of that star in
solar masses.

• A star with 60 solar masses has much higher
pressure and temperature at its core than does the
Sun.
• This causes thermonuclear reactions in the core to
occur much more rapidly and release energy at a
much faster rate — 790,000 times faster than in
the Sun.
• Energy is emitted from the star’s surface at the
same rate that it is released in the core, so the star
has 790,000 times the Sun’s luminosity.
• The tremendous rate of energy release also heats
the star’s interior tremendously, increasing the star’s
internal pressure. This inflates the star to 15 times
the Sun’s radius.
• The star’s surface must be at a high temperature
(about 44,500 K) in order for it to emit energy into
space at such a rapid rate.

• A star with 0.21 solar mass has much lower
pressure and temperature at its core than does the
Sun.
• This causes thermonuclear reactions in the core to
occur much more slowly and release energy at a
much slower rate — 0.011 times as fast as in the
Sun.
• Energy is emitted from the star’s surface at the
same rate that it is released in the core, so the star
has 0.011 of the Sun’s luminosity.
• The low rate of energy release supplies relatively
little heat to the star’s interior, so the star’s internal
pressure is low. Hence the star’s radius is only 0.33
times the Sun’s radius.
• The star’s surface need be at only a low
temperature (about 3200 K) to emit energy into
space at such a relatively slow rate.

massive stars (at the lower right in the H-R diagram) to more
massive stars (at the upper left), the radius and surface temperature both increase.
Calculations using hydrostatic and thermal equilibrium also
show that if a star’s mass is less than about 0.08M䉺, the core
pressure and temperature are too low for thermonuclear reactions
to take place. The “star” is then a brown dwarf. Brown dwarfs
also obey a mass-luminosity relation: The greater the mass, the
faster the brown dwarf contracts because of its own gravity, the
more rapidly it radiates energy into space, and, hence, the more
luminous the brown dwarf is.

CAUTION! The mass-luminosity relation we have discussed applies to main-sequence stars only. There are no simple massluminosity relations for giant, supergiant, or white dwarf stars.
Why these stars lie where they do on an H-R diagram will become apparent when we study the evolution of stars in Chapters 19 and 20. We will find that main-sequence stars evolve
into giant and supergiant stars, and that some of these eventually end their lives as white dwarfs.

The Mass-Luminosity Relation For main-sequence stars, there is a
direct correlation between mass and luminosity—the more massive a
star, the more luminous it is. A main-sequence star of mass 10 M䉺 (that
is, 10 times the Sun’s mass) has roughly 3000 times the Sun’s luminosity
(3000 L䉺); one with 0.1 M䉺 has a luminosity of only about 0.001 L䉺.

Mass and Main-Sequence Stars
Why is mass the controlling factor in determining the properties
of a main-sequence star? The answer is that all main-sequence
stars are objects like the Sun, with essentially the same chemical
composition as the Sun but with different masses. Like the Sun,
all main-sequence stars shine because thermonuclear reactions at
their cores convert hydrogen to helium and release energy. The
greater the total mass of the star, the greater the pressure and
temperature at the core, the more rapidly thermonuclear reactions
take place in the core, and the greater the energy output—that is,
the luminosity—of the star. In other words, the greater the mass
of a main-sequence star, the greater its luminosity. This statement
is just the mass-luminosity relation, which we can now recognize
as a natural consequence of the nature of main-sequence stars.
Like the Sun, main-sequence stars are in a state of both hydrostatic equilibrium and thermal equilibrium (see Section 16-2).
Calculations using models of a main-sequence star’s interior (like
the solar models we discussed in Section 16-2) show that to maintain equilibrium, a more massive star must have a larger radius
and a higher surface temperature. This is just what we see when
we plot the curve of the main sequence on an H-R diagram (see
Figure 17-15b). As you move up the main sequence from less

17-10 Spectroscopy makes it possible to
study binary systems in which the two stars
are close together
We have described how the masses of stars can be determined
from observations of visual binaries, in which the two stars can
be distinguished from each other. But if the two stars in a binary
system are too close together, the images of the two stars can
blend to produce the semblance of a single star. Happily, in many
cases we can use spectroscopy to decide whether a seemingly single star is in fact a binary system. Spectroscopic observations of
binaries provide additional useful information about star masses.
Some binaries are discovered when the spectrum of a star
shows incongruous spectral lines. For example, the spectrum of
what appears to be a single star may include both strong hydrogen lines (characteristic of a type A star) and strong absorption
bands of titanium oxide (typical of a type M star). Because a single star cannot have the differing physical properties of these two
spectral types, such a star must actually be a binary system that
is too far away for us to resolve its individual stars. A binary system detected in this way is called a spectrum binary.
Other binary systems can be detected using the Doppler effect. If a star is moving toward the Earth, its spectral lines are displaced toward the short-wavelength (blue) end of the spectrum.
Conversely, the spectral lines of a star moving away from us are
shifted toward the long-wavelength (red) end of the spectrum.
The upper portion of Figure 17-22 applies these ideas to a hypothetical binary star system with an orbital plane that is edge-on
to our line of sight.
As the two stars move around their orbits, they periodically
approach and recede from us. Hence, the spectral lines of the two
stars are alternately blueshifted and redshifted. The two stars in
this hypothetical system are so close together that they appear
through a telescope as a single star with a single spectrum.

and the spectra of the binary at four selected moments (stages 1, 2, 3,
and 4) during an orbital period. Note that at stages 1 and 3, the Doppler

Because one star shows a blueshift while the other is showing a redshift, the spectral lines of the binary system appear to split apart
and rejoin periodically. Stars whose binary character is revealed
by such shifting spectral lines are called spectroscopic binaries.

radial velocity versus time, called a radial velocity curve, for the
binary system HD 171978. Each of the two stars alternately ap-

proaches and recedes as it orbits around the center of mass. The
pattern of the curves repeats every 15 days, which is the orbital
period of the binary.
Figure 17-23 shows two spectra of the spectroscopic binary
␬ (kappa) Arietis taken a few days apart. In Figure 17-23a, two
sets of spectral lines are visible, offset slightly in opposite directions from the normal positions of these lines. This corresponds
to stage 1 or stage 3 in Figure 17-22; one of the orbiting stars is
moving toward the Earth and has its spectral lines blueshifted,
and the other star is moving away from the Earth and has its lines
redshifted. A few days later, the stars have progressed along their
orbits so that neither star is moving toward or away from the
Earth, corresponding to stage 2 or stage 4 in Figure 17-22. At this
time there are no Doppler shifts, and the spectral lines of both
stars are at the same positions. That is why only one set of spectral lines appears in Figure 17-23b.
It is important to emphasize that the Doppler effect applies
only to motion along the line of sight. Motion perpendicular to

to eclipse each other periodically, then we must be viewing the orbit nearly edge-on. As we will see next, individual stellar masses—
as well as other useful data—can be determined if a spectroscopic
binary also happens to be such an eclipsing binary.

A Spectroscopic Binary The visible-light spectrum of the double-line
spectroscopic binary ␬ (kappa) Arietis has spectral lines that shift back
and forth as the two stars revolve about each other. (Lick Observatory)

the line of sight does not affect the observed wavelengths of spectral lines. Hence, the ideal orientation for a spectroscopic binary
is to have the stars orbit in a plane that is edge-on to our line of
sight. (By contrast, a visual binary is best observed if the orbital
plane is face-on to our line of sight.) For the Doppler shifts to be
noticeable, the orbital speeds of the two stars should be at least
a few kilometers per second.
The binaries depicted in Figures 17-22 and 17-23 are called
double-line spectroscopic binaries, because the spectral lines of
both stars in the binary system can be seen. Most spectroscopic
binaries, however, are single-line spectroscopic binaries: One of
the stars is so dim that its spectral lines cannot be detected. The
star is obviously a binary, however, because its spectral lines shift
back and forth, thereby revealing the orbital motions of two stars
about their center of mass.
As for visual binaries, spectroscopic binaries allow astronomers to learn about stellar masses. From a radial velocity
curve, one can find the ratio of the masses of the two stars in a
binary. The sum of the masses is related to the orbital speeds of
the two stars by Kepler’s laws and Newtonian mechanics. If both
the ratio of the masses and their sum are known, the individual
masses can be determined using algebra. However, determining
the sum of the masses requires that we know how the binary orbits are tilted from our line of sight. This is because the Doppler
shifts reveal only the radial velocities of the stars rather than their
true orbital speeds. This tilt is often impossible to determine, because we cannot see the individual stars in the binary. Thus, the
masses of stars in spectroscopic binaries tend to be uncertain.
There is one important case in which we can determine the
orbital tilt of a spectroscopic binary. If the two stars are observed

Some binary systems are oriented so that the two stars periodically eclipse each other as seen from the Earth. These eclipsing binaries can be detected even when the two stars cannot be resolved
visually as two distinct images in the telescope. The apparent
brightness of the image of the binary dims briefly each time one
star blocks the light from the other.
Using a sensitive detector at the focus of a telescope, an astronomer can measure the incoming light intensity quite accurately and create a light curve (Figure 17-24). The shape of the
light curve for an eclipsing binary reveals at a glance whether the
eclipse is partial or total (compare Figures 17-24a and 17-24b).
Figure 17-24d shows an observation of a binary system undergoing a total eclipse.
In fact, the light curve of an

amount of information. For exam- reveal the sizes and
ple, the ratio of the surface temper- shapes of stars
atures can be determined from how
much their combined light is diminished when the stars eclipse each other. Also, the duration of a
mutual eclipse tells astronomers about the relative sizes of the
stars and their orbits.
If the eclipsing binary is also a double-line spectroscopic binary, an astronomer can calculate the mass and radius of each
star from the light curves and the velocity curves. Unfortunately,
very few binary stars are of this ideal type. Stellar radii determined in this way agree well with the values found using the
Stefan-Boltzmann law, as described in Section 17-6.
The shape of a light curve can reveal many additional details
about a binary system. In some binaries, for example, the gravitational pull of one star distorts the other, much as the Moon distorts the Earth’s oceans in producing tides (see Figure 4-26).
Figure 17-24c shows how such tidal distortion gives the light
curve a different shape than in Figure 17-24b.
Information about stellar atmospheres can also be derived
from light curves. Suppose that one star of a binary is a luminous
main-sequence star and the other is a bloated red giant. By observing exactly how the light from the bright main-sequence star
is gradually cut off as it moves behind the edge of the red giant
during the beginning of an eclipse, astronomers can infer the pressure and density in the upper atmosphere of the red giant.
Binary systems are tremendously important because they enable astronomers to measure stellar masses as well as other key
properties of stars. In the next several chapters, we will use
this information to help us piece together the story of stellar
evolution—how stars are born, evolve, and eventually die.

Key Ideas
Measuring Distances to Nearby Stars: Distances to the nearer
stars can be determined by parallax, the apparent shift of a star
against the background stars observed as the Earth moves along
its orbit.
• Parallax measurements made from orbit, above the blurring effects of the atmosphere, are much more accurate than those made
with Earth-based telescopes.
• Stellar parallaxes can only be measured for stars within a few
hundred parsecs.
The Inverse-Square Law: A star’s luminosity (total light output),
apparent brightness, and distance from the Earth are related by

464

Chapter 17

the inverse-square law. If any two of these quantities are known,
the third can be calculated.
The Population of Stars: Stars of relatively low luminosity are
more common than more luminous stars. Our own Sun is a rather
average star of intermediate luminosity.
The Magnitude Scale: The apparent magnitude scale is an alternative way to measure a star’s apparent brightness.
• The absolute magnitude of a star is the apparent magnitude it
would have if viewed from a distance of 10 parsecs. A version of
the inverse-square law relates a star’s absolute magnitude, apparent magnitude, and distance.
Photometry and Color Ratios: Photometry measures the apparent
brightness of a star. The color ratios of a star are the ratios of
brightness values obtained through different standard filters, such
as the U, B, and V filters. These ratios are a measure of the star’s
surface temperature.
Spectral Types: Stars are classified into spectral types (subdivisions of the spectral classes O, B, A, F, G, K, and M), based on
the major patterns of spectral lines in their spectra. The spectral
class and type of a star is directly related to its surface temperature: O stars are the hottest and M stars are the coolest.
• Most brown dwarfs are in even cooler spectral classes called L
and T. Unlike true stars, brown dwarfs are too small to sustain
thermonuclear fusion.
Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram: The Hertzsprung-Russell (H-R) diagram is a graph plotting the absolute magnitudes of stars against
their spectral types—or, equivalently, their luminosities against
surface temperatures.
• The positions on the H-R diagram of most stars are along the
main sequence, a band that extends from high luminosity and
high surface temperature to low luminosity and low surface
temperature.
• On the H-R diagram, giant and supergiant stars lie above the
main sequence, while white dwarfs are below the main sequence.
• By carefully examining a star’s spectral lines, astronomers can
determine whether that star is a main-sequence star, giant, supergiant, or white dwarf. Using the H-R diagram and the inversesquare law, the star’s luminosity and distance can be found
without measuring its stellar parallax.
Binary Stars: Binary stars, in which two stars are held in orbit
around each other by their mutual gravitational attraction, are
surprisingly common. Those that can be resolved into two distinct
star images by an Earth-based telescope are called visual binaries.
• Each of the two stars in a binary system moves in an elliptical
orbit about the center of mass of the system.
• Binary stars are important because they allow astronomers to
determine the masses of the two stars in a binary system. The
masses can be computed from measurements of the orbital period
and orbital dimensions of the system.
Mass-Luminosity Relation for Main-Sequence Stars: Mainsequence stars are stars like the Sun but with different masses.

• The mass-luminosity relation expresses a direct correlation between mass and luminosity for main-sequence stars. The greater
the mass of a main-sequence star, the greater its luminosity (and
also the greater its radius and surface temperature).
Spectroscopic Observations of Binary Stars: Some binaries can be
detected and analyzed, even though the system may be so distant
or the two stars so close together that the two star images cannot
be resolved.
• A spectrum binary appears to be a single star but has a spectrum with the absorption lines for two distinctly different spectral types.
• A spectroscopic binary has spectral lines that shift back and
forth in wavelength. This is caused by the Doppler effect, as the
orbits of the stars carry them first toward then away from the
Earth.
• An eclipsing binary is a system whose orbits are viewed nearly
edge-on from the Earth, so that one star periodically eclipses the
other. Detailed information about the stars in an eclipsing binary
can be obtained from a study of the binary’s radial velocity curve
and its light curve.

have to move in order for a star 1 pc away to appear to move

70. It is desirable to be able to measure the radial velocity of stars
(using the Doppler effect) to an accuracy of 1 km/s or better.
One complication is that radial velocities refer to the motion

made using a telescope on the Earth. Is it important to take
into account the motion of the Earth around the Sun? Is it
important to take into account the Earth’s rotational motion?
To answer this question, you will have to calculate the Earth’s
orbital speed and the speed of a point on the Earth’s equator
(the part of the Earth’s surface that moves at the greatest
speed because of the planet’s rotation). If one or both of these

Even through a telescope, the colors of stars are
sometimes subtle and difficult to see. To give your
eye the best chance of seeing color, use the “averted vision”
trick: When looking through the telescope eyepiece, direct
your vision a little to one side of the star you are most interested in. This places the light from that star on a more sensitive part of your eye’s retina.

he stars that illuminate our nights seem eternal and unchanging. But this permanence is an illusion. Each of the
stars visible to the naked eye shines due to thermonuclear
reactions and has only a finite amount of fuel available for these
reactions. Hence, stars cannot last forever: They form from material in interstellar space, evolve over millions or billions of years,
and eventually die. In this chapter our concern is with how stars
are born and become part of the main sequence.
Stars form within cold, dark clouds of gas and dust that are
scattered abundantly throughout our Galaxy. One such cloud appears as a dark area on the far right-hand side of the photograph
at the top of this page. Perhaps a dark cloud like this encounters
one of the Galaxy’s spiral arms, or perhaps a supernova detonates
nearby. From the shock of events like these, the cloud begins to
contract under the pull of gravity, forming protostars—the fragments that will one day become stars. As a protostar develops, its
internal pressure builds and its temperature rises. In time, hydrogen fusion begins, and a star is born. The hottest, bluest, and
brightest young stars, like those in the accompanying image, emit
ultraviolet radiation that excites the surrounding interstellar gas.
The result is a beautiful glowing nebula, which typically has the
red color characteristic of excited hydrogen (as shown in the
photograph).
In Chapters 19 and 20 we will see how stars mature and
grow old. Some even blow themselves apart in death throes that
enrich interstellar space with the material for future generations
of stars. Thus, like the mythical phoenix, new stars arise from the
ashes of the old.

18-1 Understanding how stars evolve
requires observation as well as ideas
from physics
Over the past several decades, astronomers have labored to develop an understanding of stellar evolution, that is, how stars are
born, live their lives, and finally die. Our own Sun provides evidence that stars are not permanent. The energy radiated by the
Sun comes from thermonuclear reactions in its core, which consume Stars consume the
6 ⫻ 1011 kg of hydrogen each secmaterial of which they
ond and convert it into helium (see
Section 16-1). While the amount of are made, and so cannot
hydrogen in the Sun’s core is vast, it last forever
is not infinite; therefore, the Sun cannot always have been shining, nor can it continue to shine forever. The same is true for all other main-sequence stars, which are
fundamentally the same kinds of objects as the Sun but with different masses (see Section 17-9). Thus, stars must have a beginning as well as an end.

Chapter 18

Stars last very much longer than the lifetime of any
astronomer—indeed, far longer than the entire history of human
civilization. Thus, it is impossible to watch a single star go through
its formation, evolution, and eventual demise. Rather, astronomers
have to piece together the evolutionary history of stars by studying different stars at different stages in their life cycles.

ANALOGY To see the magnitude of this task, imagine that you
are a biologist from another planet who sets out to understand
the life cycles of human beings. You send a spacecraft to fly
above the Earth and photograph humans in action. Unfortunately, the spacecraft fails after collecting only 20 seconds of
data, but during that time its sophisticated equipment sends
back observations of thousands of different humans. From this
brief snapshot of life on the Earth—only 10⫺8 (a hundredmillionth) of a typical human lifetime—how would you decide
which were the young humans and which were the older ones?
Without a look inside our bodies to see the biological processes
that shape our lives, could you tell how humans are born and
how they die? And how could you deduce the various biological changes that humans undergo as they age?
Astronomers, too, have data spanning only a tiny fraction of
any star’s lifetime. A star like the Sun can last for about 1010
years, whereas astronomers have been observing stars in detail for
only about a century—as in our analogy, roughly 10⫺8 of the life
span of a typical star. Astronomers are also frustrated by being
unable to see the interiors of stars. For example, we cannot see
the thermonuclear reactions that convert hydrogen into helium.
But astronomers have an advantage over the biologist in our
story. Unlike humans, stars are made of relatively simple substances, primarily hydrogen and helium, that are found almost exclusively in the form of gases. Of the three phases of matter—gas,
liquid, and solid—gases are by far the simplest to understand.
Astronomers use our understanding of gases to build theoretical models of the interiors of stars, like the model of the Sun we
saw in Section 16-2. Models help to complete the story of stellar
evolution. In fact, like all great dramas, the story of stellar evolution can be regarded as a struggle between two opposing and unyielding forces: Gravity continually tries to make a star shrink,
while the star’s internal pressure tends to make the star expand.
When these two opposing forces are in balance, the star is in a
state of hydrostatic equilibrium (see Figure 16-2).
But what happens when changes within the star cause either
pressure or gravity to predominate? The star must then either expand or contract until it reaches a new equilibrium. In the process,
it will change not only in size but also in luminosity and color.
In the following chapters, we will find that giant and supergiant stars are the result of pressure gaining the upper hand over
gravity. Both giants and supergiants turn out to be aging stars
that have become tremendously luminous and ballooned to hundreds or thousands of times their previous size. White dwarfs, by
contrast, are the result of the balance tipping in gravity’s favor.
These are even older stars that have collapsed to a fraction of the
size they had while on the main sequence. In this chapter, however, we will see how the combat between gravity and pressure
explains the birth of stars. We start our journey within the diffuse clouds of gas and dust that permeate our galaxy.

tion of gas and dust in interstellar reflect light
space. Observations suggest that
other stars originate in a similar way (see Figure 8-8). To understand the formation of stars, we must first understand the nature
of the interstellar matter from which the stars form.

Nebulae and the Interstellar Medium
At first glance, the space between the stars seems to be empty. On
closer inspection, we find that it is filled with a thin gas laced with
microscopic dust particles. This combination of gas and dust is
called the interstellar medium. Evidence for this medium includes
interstellar clouds of various types, curious lines in the spectra of
binary star systems, and an apparent dimming and reddening of
distant stars.
You can see evidence for the interstellar medium with the
naked eye. Look carefully at the constellation Orion (Figure
18-1a), visible on winter nights in the northern hemisphere and
summer nights in the southern hemisphere. While most of the
stars in the constellation appear as sharply defined points of light,
the middle “star” in Orion’s sword has a fuzzy appearance. This
becomes more obvious with binoculars or a telescope. As Figure
18-1b shows, this “star” is actually not a star at all, but the Orion
Nebula—a cloud in interstellar space. Any interstellar cloud is
called a nebula (plural nebulae) or nebulosity.

Emission Nebulae: Clouds of Excited Gas
The Orion Nebula emits its own light, with the characteristic
emission line spectrum of a hot, thin gas. For this reason it is
called an emission nebula. Many emission nebulae can be seen
with a small telescope. Figure 18-2 shows some of these nebulae
in a different part of the constellation Orion. Emission nebulae
are direct evidence of gas atoms in the interstellar medium.
Typical emission nebulae have masses that range from about
100 to about 10,000 solar masses. Because this mass is spread
over a huge volume that is light-years across, the density is quite
low by Earth standards, only a few thousand hydrogen atoms per
cubic centimeter. (By comparison, the air you are breathing contains more than 1019 atoms per cm3.)
Emission nebulae are found near hot, luminous stars of spectral types O and B. Such stars emit copious amounts of ultraviolet radiation. When atoms in the nearby interstellar gas absorb
these energetic ultraviolet photons, the atoms become ionized. Indeed, emission nebulae are composed primarily of ionized hydrogen atoms, that is, free protons (hydrogen nuclei) and electrons.
Astronomers use the notation H I for neutral, un-ionized hydrogen atoms and H II for ionized hydrogen atoms, which is why
emission nebulae are also called H II regions.
H II regions emit visible light when some of the free protons
and electrons get back together to form hydrogen atoms, a process

called recombination (Figure 18-3). When an atom forms by recombination, the electron is typically captured into a high-energy
orbit. As the electron cascades downward through the atom’s energy levels toward the ground state, the atom emits photons with
lower energy and longer wavelength than the photons that originally caused the ionization. Particularly important is the transition from n ⫽ 3 to n ⫽ 2. It produces H␣ photons with a
wavelength of 656 nm, in the red portion of the visible spectrum
(see Section 5-8, especially Figure 5-23b). These photons give
H II regions their distinctive reddish color.
For each high-energy, ultraviolet photon absorbed by a hydrogen atom to ionize it, several photons of lower energy are
emitted when a proton and electron recombine. As Box 18-1 describes, a similar effect takes place in a fluorescent lightbulb. In
this sense, H II regions are immense fluorescent light fixtures!

4. The electron jumps to successively lower-energy
orbits. With each jump, the atom emits a
photon with less energy and longer wavelength
than the ultraviolet photons in Step 1. These
emitted photons give the hydrogen a
characteristic visible glow.

Figure 18-3
Ionization and Recombination The characteristic glow of emission nebulae (like those shown in
Figure 18-1 and Figure 18-2) comes from gas atoms that are excited by ultraviolet radiation from
nearby hot stars.

Further evidence of interstellar gas comes from the spectra of
binary star systems. As the two stars that make up a binary system orbit their common center of mass, their spectral lines shift
back and forth (see Figure 17-23). But certain calcium and sodium

BOX 18-1

lines are found to remain at fixed wavelengths. These stationary
absorption lines are therefore not associated with the binary star.
Instead, they must be caused by interstellar gas between us and
the binary system.

The Heavens on the Earth

Fluorescent Lights
he light that comes from glowing interstellar clouds is, quite
literally, otherworldly. But the same principles that explain
T
how such clouds emit light are also at the heart of light phenomena that we see here on the Earth.
A fluorescent lamp produces light in a manner not too different from an emission nebula (H II region). In both cases, the
physical effect is called fluorescence: High-energy ultraviolet
photons are absorbed, and the absorbed energy is reradiated
as lower-energy photons of visible light.
Within the glass tube of a fluorescent lamp is a small
amount of the element mercury. When you turn on the lamp,
an electric current passes through the tube, vaporizing the mercury and exciting its atoms. This excited mercury vapor radiates light with an emission-line spectrum, including lines in the
ultraviolet. The white fluorescent coating on the inside of the
glass tube absorbs these ultraviolet photons, exciting the coating’s molecules to high energy levels.

The molecules then cascade down through a number of
lower levels before reaching the ground state. During this cascade, visible-light photons of many different wavelengths are
emitted, giving an essentially continuous spectrum and a very
white light. (By comparison, the hydrogen atoms in an H II region emit at only certain discrete wavelengths, because the
spectrum of hydrogen is much simpler than that of the fluorescent coating’s molecules. Another difference is that the molecules in the fluorescent tube never become ionized.)
Many common materials display fluorescence. Among
them are teeth, fingernails, and certain minerals. When illuminated with ultraviolet light, these materials glow with a blue
or green color. (Most natural history museums and science
museums have an exhibit showing fluorescent minerals.) Laundry detergent also contains fluorescent material. After washing, your laundry absorbs ultraviolet light from the Sun and
glows faintly, making it appear “whiter than white.”

Dark Nebulae and Reflection Nebulae: Abodes of Dust
In addition to the presence of gas atoms in H II regions, Figure
18-2 also shows two kinds of evidence for larger bits of matter,
called dust grains, in the interstellar medium. These dust grains
make their appearance in dark nebulae and reflection nebulae.
A dark nebula is so opaque that it blocks any visible light
coming from stars that lie behind it. One such dark nebula, called
the Horsehead Nebula for its shape, protrudes in front of one of
the H II regions in Figure 18-2. Figure 18-4 shows another dark
nebula, called Barnard 86. These nebulae have a relatively dense
concentration of microscopic dust grains, which scatter and absorb light much more efficiently than single atoms. Typical dark
nebulae have temperatures between 10 K to 100 K, which is low
enough for hydrogen atoms to form molecules. Such nebulae contain from 104 to 109 particles (atoms, molecules, and dust grains)
per cubic centimeter. Although tenuous by Earth standards, dark
nebulae are large enough—typically many light-years deep—that
they block the passage of light. In the same way, a sufficient depth
of haze or smoke in our atmosphere can make it impossible to see
distant mountains.
The other evidence for dust in Figure 18-2 is the bluish haze
surrounding the star immediately above and to the left of the
Horsehead Nebula. Figure 18-5 shows a similar haze around a
different set of stars. A haze of this kind, called a reflection neb-

Reflection Nebulae Wispy reflection nebulae called NGC 6726-27-29
surround several stars in the constellation Corona Australis (the Southern
Crown). Unlike emission nebulae, reflection nebulae do not emit their own
light, but scatter and reflect light from the stars that they surround. This
scattered starlight is quite blue in color. The region shown here is about
23 arcminutes across. (David Malin/Anglo-Australian Observatory)

ula, is caused by fine grains of dust in a lower concentration than
that found in dark nebulae. The light we see coming from the
nebula is starlight that has been scattered and reflected by these
dust grains. The grains are only about 500 nm across, no larger
than a typical wavelength of visible light, and they scatter shortwavelength blue light more efficiently than long-wavelength red
light. Hence, reflection nebulae have a characteristic blue color.
Box 5-4 explains how a similar process—the scattering of sunlight
in our atmosphere—gives rise to the blue color of the sky.

Interstellar Extinction and Reddening

RI V UXG

A Dark Nebula When first discovered in the late 1700s, dark nebulae
were thought to be “holes in the heavens” where very few stars are
present. In fact, they are opaque regions that block out light from the
stars beyond them. The few stars that appear to be within Barnard 86 lie
between us and the nebula. Barnard 86 is in the constellation Sagittarius
and has an angular diameter of 4 arcminutes, about 1/7 the angular
diameter of the full moon. (Anglo-Australian Observatory)

In the 1930s, the American astronomer Robert Trumpler discovered two other convincing pieces of evidence for the existence of
interstellar matter—interstellar extinction and interstellar reddening. While studying the brightness and distances of certain star
clusters, Trumpler noticed that remote clusters seem to be dimmer than would be expected from their distance alone. His observations demonstrated that the intensity of light from remote stars
is reduced as the light passes through material in interstellar space.
This process is called interstellar extinction. (In the same way, the
headlights of oncoming cars appear dimmer when there is smoke
or fog in the air.) The light from remote stars is also reddened
as it passes through the interstellar medium, because the blue

Interstellar Reddening (a) Dust grains in interstellar space scatter or

appears redder than it really is. (b) The emission nebulae NGC 3603 and
NGC 3576 are different distances from Earth. Light from the more distant

component of their starlight is scattered and absorbed by interstellar dust. This effect, shown in Figure 18-6, is called interstellar reddening. The same effect makes the setting Sun look red (see
Box 5-4).

CAUTION! It is important to understand the distinction between interstellar reddening and the Doppler effect. If an object
is moving away from us, the Doppler effect shifts all of that object’s light toward longer wavelengths (a redshift). Interstellar
reddening, by contrast, makes objects appear red not by shifting
wavelengths but by filtering out short wavelengths. The effect is
the same as if we looked at an object through red-colored glasses,
which let red light pass but block out blue light. The one similarity between Doppler shifts and interstellar reddening is that
neither has any discernible effect on what you see with the naked
eye. Both of these effects cause only subtle color changes that
your eye (which does a poor job of seeing colors in faint objects
like stars) cannot detect. If you see a star with a red color, the
reason is not interstellar reddening or the Doppler effect; it is
because the star really is red due to its low surface temperature
(see Figure 17-7).

Observations indicate that bright stars, gas, and glowing nebulae
are mostly located within a few hundred parsecs of the midplane
of our Galaxy, and that they are concentrated along arching spiral arms that wind outward from the Galaxy’s center. If we could

Interstellar gas and dust are the raw material from which
stars are made. The disk of our Galaxy, where most of this matter is concentrated, is therefore the site of ongoing star formation.
Our next goal is to examine the steps by which stars are formed.

dark nebulae. Many of these, such as the Horsehead Nebula (see
Figure 18-2) and Barnard 86 (see Figure 18-4), were discovered
and catalogued around 1900 by Edward Barnard and are known
as Barnard objects. (The Horsehead Nebula is also known as
Barnard 33.) Other relatively small, nearly spherical dark nebulae are known as Bok globules, after the Dutch-American astronomer Bart Bok, who first called attention to them during the
1940s (Figure 18-9). A Bok globule resembles the inner core of a
Barnard object with the outer, less dense portions stripped away.
The density of the gas and dust within a Barnard object or Bok
globule is indeed quite high by cosmic standards, in the range
from 100 to 10,000 particles per cm3; by comparison, most of the
interstellar medium contains only 0.1 to 20 particles per cm3. Radio emissions from molecules within these clouds indicate that
their internal temperatures are very low, only about 10 K.
A typical Barnard object contains a few thousand solar masses
of gas and dust spread over a volume roughly 10 pc (30 ly) across;
a typical Bok globule is about one-tenth as large. The chemical
composition of this material is the standard “cosmic abundance”
of about 74% (by mass) hydrogen, 25% helium, and 1% heavier
elements (review Figure 8-4). Within these clouds, the densest
portions can contract under their

18-3 Protostars form in cold, dark nebulae
How do stars form in the interstellar medium? In this section, we
discuss how a contracting cloud gives birth to a clump called a
protostar—a future main-sequence star.

Protostars: Initial Gravitational Collapse
In order for interstellar material to condense and form a star, the
force of gravity—which tends to draw interstellar material
together—must overwhelm the internal pressure pushing the material apart. This means that stars will most easily form in regions
where the interstellar material is relatively dense, so that atoms
and dust grains are close together and gravitational attraction is
enhanced.
To assist star formation, the pressure of the interstellar
medium should be relatively low. This means that the interstellar
medium should be as cold as possible, because the pressure of a
gas goes down as the gas temperature decreases. (Conversely, increasing the temperature makes the pressure increase. That’s why
the air pressure inside automobile tires is higher after the auto has
been driven a while and the tires have warmed up.)
The only parts of the interstellar medium with high enough
density and low enough temperature for stars to form are the

Chapter 18

Section 16-1.) Energy from the interior of the protostar is transported outward by convection, warming its surface.
After only a few thousand years of gravitational contraction,
the protostar’s surface temperature reaches 2000 to 3000 K. At
this point the protostar is still quite large, so its glowing gases
produce substantial luminosity. (The greater a star’s radius and
surface temperature, the greater its luminosity. You can review
the details in Section 17-6 and Box 17-4.) For example, after only
1000 years of contraction, a protostar of 1 solar mass (1 M䉺) is
20 times larger in radius than the Sun and has 100 times the Sun’s
luminosity. Unlike the Sun, however, the luminosity of a young
protostar is not the result of thermonuclear fusion, because the
protostar’s core is not yet hot enough for fusion reactions to begin. Instead, the radiated energy comes exclusively from the heating of the protostar as it contracts.
In order to determine the conditions inside a contracting protostar, astrophysicists use computers to solve equations similar to
those used for calculating the structure of the Sun (see Section
18-2). The results tell how the protostar’s luminosity and surface
temperature change at various stages in its contraction. This information, when plotted on a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, provides a protostar’s evolutionary track. The track shows us how
the protostar’s appearance changes because of changes in its interior. These theoretical tracks agree quite well with actual observations of protostars.

out of a single such nebula. Thus, we can think of dark nebulae
as “stellar nurseries.”

The Evolution of a Protostar
In the 1950s, astrophysicists such as Louis Henyey in the United
States and C. Hayashi in Japan performed calculations that enabled them to describe the earliest stages of a protostar. At first,
a protostar is merely a cool blob of gas several times larger than
our solar system. The pressure inside the protostar is too low to
support all this cool gas against the mutual gravitational attraction of its parts, and so the protostar collapses. As the protostar
collapses, gravitational energy is converted into thermal energy,
making the gases heat up and start glowing. (We discussed this
process, called Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction, in Section 8-4 and

bit of mass as they evolve: The mass shown for each track is the value
when the protostar finally settles down as a main-sequence star.)

evolutionary track” or “moving on the H-R diagram,” they
mean that the star’s luminosity, surface temperature, or both
change. Hence, the point that represents the star on an H-R diagram changes its position. This is completely unrelated to how
the star physically moves through space!
Figure 18-10 shows evolutionary tracks for protostars
of seven different masses, ranging from 0.5 M䉺 to 15 M䉺. Because protostars are relatively cool when they begin to shine at
visible wavelengths, these tracks all begin near the right (lowtemperature) side of the H-R diagram. The subsequent evolution
is somewhat different, however, depending on the protostar’s
mass. Note that the greater a star’s mass, the more rapidly it
moves along its evolutionary track: a 15-M䉺 protostar takes only
about 105 years to reach the main sequence, while a 1-M䉺 protostar takes over a hundred times longer (more than 107 years).

Observing Protostars
Observing the evolution of a protostar can be quite a challenge.
Indeed, while Figure 18-10 shows that young protostars are much
more luminous than the Sun, it is quite unlikely that you have
ever seen a protostar shining in the night sky. The reason is that
protostars form within clouds that contain substantial amounts of
interstellar dust. The dust in a protostar’s immediate surroundings, called its cocoon nebula, absorbs the vast amounts of visible light emitted by the protostar and makes it very hard to detect
using visible wavelengths.

BL

INK 1

Protostars can be seen, however, using infrared wavelengths. Because it absorbs so much energy from the
protostar that it surrounds, a dusty cocoon nebula becomes heated to a few hundred kelvins. The warmed dust then
reradiates its thermal energy at infrared wavelengths, to which the
cocoon nebula is relatively transparent. So, by using infrared telescopes, astronomers can see protostars within the “stellar nursery” of a dark nebula.
Figure 18-11 shows visible-light and infrared views of one
such stellar nursery. The visible-light view (Figure 18-11a) shows
a dark, dusty nebula that appears completely opaque. The infrared image (Figure 18-11b) allows us to see through the dust,
revealing a newly formed protostar within the dark nebula. The
properties of this protostar agree well with the theoretical ideas
outlined in this section.

Evolutionary tracks show how a protostar matures into a star as
its gases contract. The details of this evolution depend on the
star’s mass. To follow these details, you should keep in mind the
basic principle that a star’s luminosity, radius, and surface temperature are intimately related: luminosity is proportional to the The course of a
square of radius and to the fourth protostar’s evolution
power of surface temperature (see

Section 17-6).

Chapter 18

A One-Solar-Mass Protostar

Convective

For a protostar with the same mass as our Sun (1 M䉺), the outer
layers are cool and quite opaque (for the same reasons that the
Sun’s photosphere is opaque; see Section 16-5). This means that
energy released from the shrinking inner layers in the form of radiation cannot reach the surface. Instead, energy flows outward
by the slower and less effective method of convection. Hence, the
surface temperature of the contracting protostar stays roughly
constant, the luminosity decreases as the radius decreases, and the
evolutionary track moves downward on the H-R diagram in
Figure 18-10.
Although its surface temperature changes relatively little, the
internal temperature of the shrinking protostar increases. After a
time, the interior becomes ionized, which makes it less opaque.
Energy is then conveyed outward by radiation in the interior and
by convection in the opaque outer layers, just as in the presentday Sun (see Section 16-2, especially Figure 16-4). This makes it
easier for energy to escape from the protostar, so the luminosity—
the rate at which energy is emitted from the protostar’s surface—
increases. As a result, the evolutionary track in Figure 18-10
bends upward (higher luminosity) and to the left (higher surface
temperature, caused by the increased energy flow).
In time, the 1-M䉺 protostar’s interior temperature reaches a
few million kelvins, hot enough for thermonuclear reactions to
begin converting hydrogen into helium. As we saw in Section
16-1 and Box 16-1, these reactions release enormous amounts of
energy. Eventually, these reactions provide enough heat and internal pressure to stop the star’s gravitational contraction, and hydrostatic equilibrium is reached. The protostar’s evolutionary
track has now led it to the main sequence, and the protostar has
become a full-fledged main-sequence star.

Main-Sequence Stars of Different Masses Stellar models
show that when a protostar evolves into a main-sequence
star, its internal structure depends on its mass. Note: The three stars
shown here are not drawn to scale. Compared with a 1-M䉺 main-sequence
star like that shown in (b), a 6-M䉺 main-sequence star like that in (a) has
more than 4 times the radius, and a 0.2-M䉺 main-sequence star like that
in (c) has only one-third the radius.

EX

More massive protostars evolve a bit differently. If its mass is
more than about 4 M䉺, a protostar contracts and heats more rapidly, and hydrogen fusion begins quite early. As a result, the luminosity quickly stabilizes at nearly its final value, while the
surface temperature continues to increase as the star shrinks.
Thus, the evolutionary tracks of massive protostars traverse the
H-R diagram roughly horizontally (signifying approximately constant luminosity) in the direction from right to left (from low to
high surface temperature). You can see this most easily for the
9-M䉺 and 15-M䉺 evolutionary tracks in Figure 18-10.
Greater mass means greater pressure and temperature in the
interior, which means that a massive star has an even larger temperature difference between its core and its outer layers than the
Sun. This causes convection deep in the interior of a massive star
(Figure 18-12). By contrast, a massive star’s outer layers are of
such low density that energy flows through them more easily by
radiation than by convection. Therefore, main-sequence stars
with masses more than about 4 M䉺 have convective interiors but
radiative outer layers (Figure 18-12a). By contrast, less massive
main-sequence stars such as the Sun have radiative interiors and
convective outer layers (Figure 18-12b).
The internal structure is also different for main-sequence
stars of very low mass. When such a star forms from a protostar,

the interior temperature is never high enough to fully ionize the
interior. The interior remains too opaque for radiation to flow efficiently, so energy is transported by convection throughout the
volume of the star (Figure 18-12c).

Arriving on the Main Sequence
All of the protostar evolutionary tracks in Figure 18-10 end on
the main sequence. The main sequence therefore represents stars
in which thermonuclear reactions are converting hydrogen into
helium. For most stars, this is a stable situation. For example, our
Sun will remain on or very near the main sequence, quietly fusing hydrogen into helium at its core, for a total of some 1010
years. The point along the main sequence where each evolutionary track ends depends on the star’s mass. The most massive stars

After reading the previous section, you may think that a mainsequence star forms simply by collapsing inward. In fact, much of

wavelengths.

T Tauri Stars
Mass ejection into space is a hallmark of T Tauri stars. These are
protostars with emission lines as well as absorption lines in their
spectra and whose luminosity can change irregularly on time
scales of a few days. The namesake of this class of stars, T Tauri,
is a protostar in the constellation Taurus (the Bull).

Bipolar Outflows and Herbig-Haro Objects
TION
MA

In the early 1980s, it was discovered that many young
stars, including T Tauri stars, also lose mass by ejecting gas along two narrow, oppositely directed jets—a
phenomenon called bipolar outflow. As this material is ejected
into space at speeds of several hundred kilometers per second, it
collides with the surrounding interstellar medium and produces
knots of hot, ionized gas that glow with an emission-line spectrum. These glowing knots are called Herbig-Haro objects after
the two astronomers, George Herbig in the United States and
Guillermo Haro in Mexico, who discovered them independently.
Figure 18-14 is a Hubble Space Telescope image of the
Herbig-Haro objects HH 1 and HH 2, which are produced by the
two jets from a single young star in the constellation Orion.
Herbig-Haro objects like these change noticeably in position, size,
shape, and brightness from year to year, indicating the dynamic
character of bipolar outflows.
Observations suggest that most protostars eject material in
the form of jets at some point during their evolution. These bipolar outflows are very short-lived by astronomical standards, a
mere 104 to 105 years, but they are so energetic that they typically
eject into space more mass than ends up in the final protostar.

the evolutionary tracks of protostars begin in the red giant region of the H-R diagram (the upper right), protostars are not
red giants. As we will see in Chapter 19, red giant stars represent a stage in the evolution of stars that comes after being a
main-sequence star. Second, it is worth remembering that stars
live out most of their lives on the main sequence, after only a
relatively brief period as protostars. A 15-M䉺 protostar takes
only 20,000 years to become a main-sequence star, and a 1-M䉺
protostar takes about 2 ⫻ 107 years. By contrast, the Sun has
been a main-sequence star for about 4.56 ⫻ 109 years. By astronomical standards, pre–main-sequence stars are quite transitory.

T Tauri stars have masses less than about 3 M䉺 and ages
around 106 years, so on an H-R diagram such as Figure 18-10
they appear above the right-hand end of the main sequence. The
emission lines show that these protostars are surrounded by a
thin, hot gas. The Doppler shifts of these emission lines suggest
that the protostars eject gas at speeds around 80 km/s (300,000
km/h, or 180,000 mi/h).
On average, T Tauri stars eject about 10⫺8 to 10⫺7 solar
masses of material per year. This may seem like a small amount,
but by comparison the present-day Sun loses only about 10⫺14 M䉺
per year. The T Tauri phase of a protostar may last 107 years or
so, during which time the protostar may eject roughly a solar
mass of material. Thus, the mass of the final main-sequence star
is quite a bit less than that of the cloud of gas and dust from
which the star originated. (The stellar masses shown in Figure
18-10 are those of the final, main-sequence stars.)
Young stars that are more massive than about 3 M䉺 do not
vary in luminosity like T Tauri stars. They do lose mass, however,
because the pressure of radiation at their surfaces is so strong that
it blows gas into space. One place this can be seen is in the Omega
Nebula (Figure 18-13a), where new stars are being formed
(Figure 18-13b). The most massive of these stars eject gases with
such high temperatures that they emit X rays (Figure 18-13c).

ANI

are the most luminous and their evolutionary tracks end at the
upper left of the main sequence, while the least massive stars are
the least luminous and their evolutionary tracks end at the lower
right of the main sequence. The connection between a mainsequence star’s mass and luminosity should be familiar: this is just
the mass-luminosity relation (recall the Cosmic Connections figure in Section 17-9).
The theory of how protostars evolve helps explain why the
main sequence has both an upper mass limit and a lower mass
limit. As we saw in Section 17-5, protostars less massive than
about 0.08 M䉺 can never develop the necessary pressure and temperature to start hydrogen fusion in their cores. Instead, such
“failed stars” end up as brown dwarfs, which shine faintly by
Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction (see Figure 17-13).
Protostars with masses greater than about 200 solar masses
also do not become main-sequence stars. Such a protostar rapidly
becomes very luminous, resulting in tremendous internal pressures. This pressure is so great that it overwhelms the effects of
gravity, expelling the outer layers into space and disrupting the
star. Main-sequence stars therefore have masses between about
0.08 and 200 M䉺, although the high-mass stars are extremely
rare.

481

Accretion Disks
Protostars slowly add mass to themselves at the same time that
they rapidly eject it into space. In fact, the two processes are related. As a protostar’s nebula contracts, it spins faster and flattens into a disk with the protostar itself at the center. The same
flattening took place in the solar nebula, from which the Sun and
planets formed (see Section 8-4). Particles orbiting the protostar
within this disk collide with each other, causing them to lose energy, spiral inward onto the protostar, and add to the protostar’s

accretion disk, showing two oppositely directed jets emanating
from a point at or near the center of the disk (where the protostar is located).
What causes some of the material in the disk to be blasted
outward in a pair of jets? One model involves the magnetic field
of the dark nebula in which the star forms (Figure 18-16). As material in the circumstellar accretion disk falls inward, it drags the
magnetic field lines along with it. (We saw in Section 16-9 how

two helix shapes, one on each side of the disk. The helices then
act as channels that guide infalling material away from the protostar, forming two opposing jets.
Many astronomers suspect that interactions among the protostar, the accretion disk, and the jets help to slow the protostar’s
rotation. If so, this would explain why main-sequence stars generally spin much more slowly than protostars of the same final
mass.

material from which planets form around stars. They are what remains of a circumstellar accretion disk after much of the material
has either fallen onto the star or been ejected by bipolar outflows.
Not all stars are thought to form protoplanetary disks; the
exceptions probably include stars with masses in excess of about
3 M䉺, as well as many stars in binary systems. But surveys of the
Orion Nebula show that disks are found around most young,
low-mass stars. Thus, disk formation may be a natural stage in
the birth of many stars.

In the 1990s, astronomers using the Hubble Space Telescope discovered many examples of disks around newly
formed stars in the Orion Nebula (see Figure 18-1),
one of the most prominent star-forming regions in the northern
sky. Figure 8-8 shows a number of these protoplanetary disks, or
proplyds, that surround young stars within the nebula. As the

Dark nebulae contain tens or hundreds of solar masses of gas and
dust, enough to form many stars. As a consequence, these nebulae tend to form groups or clusters of young stars. One such cluster is M16, shown in Figure 18-17; another is NGC 6520, depicted
in Figure 18-4.

Star Clusters as Evolutionary Laboratories
In addition to being objects of great natural beauty, star clusters
give us a unique way to compare the evolution of different stars.
That’s because clusters typically include stars with a range of different masses, all of which began to form out of the parent nebula at roughly the same time.

ANALOGY A foot race is a useful way to compare the performance of sprinters because all the competitors start the race simultaneously. A young star cluster gives us the same kind of
opportunity to compare the evolution of stars of different masses
that all began to form roughly simultaneously. Unlike a foot

A Star Cluster with an H II Region The star

cluster M16 is thought to be no more than
800,000 years old, and star formation is still taking place within adjacent
dark, dusty globules. The inset shows three dense, cold pillars of gas and
dust silhouetted against the glowing background of the red emission

race, however, the entire “race” of evolution in a single cluster
happens too slowly for us to observe; as Figure 18-10 shows,
protostars take many thousands or millions of years to evolve
significantly. Instead, we must compare different star clusters at
various stages in their evolution to piece together the history of
star formation in a cluster.
All the stars in a cluster may begin to form nearly simultaneously, but they do not all become main-sequence stars at the same
time. As you can see from their evolutionary tracks (see Figure
18-10), high-mass stars evolve more rapidly than low-mass stars.
The more massive the protostar, the sooner it develops the central pressures and temperatures needed for steady hydrogen fusion to begin.
Upon reaching the main sequence, high-mass protostars become hot, ultraluminous stars of spectral types O and B. As we
saw in Section 18-2, these are the sorts of stars whose ultraviolet
radiation ionizes the surrounding interstellar medium to produce

nebula (called the Eagle Nebula for its shape). The pillar at the upper left
extends about 0.3 parsec (1 light-year) from base to tip, and each of
its “fingers” is somewhat broader than our entire solar system.

an H II region. Figure 18-17 shows such an H II region, called
the Eagle Nebula, surrounding the young star cluster M16. A few
hundred thousand years ago, this region of space would have had
a far less dramatic appearance. It was then a dark nebula, with
protostars just beginning to form. Over the intervening millennia,
mass ejection from these evolving protostars swept away the obscuring dust. The exposed young, hot stars heated the relatively
thin remnants of the original dark nebula, creating the H II region that we see today.
When the most massive protostars to form out of a dark nebula have reached the main sequence, other low-mass protostars
are still evolving nearby within their dusty cocoons. The evolution of these low-mass stars can be disturbed by their more massive neighbors. As an example, the inset in Figure 18-17 is a
close-up of part of the Eagle Nebula. Within these opaque pillars
of cold gas and dust, protostars are still forming. At the same
time, however, the pillars are being eroded by intense ultraviolet
light from hot, massive stars that have already shed their cocoons.

As each pillar evaporates, the embryonic stars within have their
surrounding material stripped away prematurely, limiting the total mass that these stars can accrete.

Analyzing Young Clusters Using H-R Diagrams
Star clusters tell us still more about how high-mass and low-mass
stars evolve. Figure 18-18a shows the young star cluster NGC
2264 and its associated emission nebula. Astronomers have measured each star’s apparent brightness and color ratio. Knowing
the distance to the cluster, they have deduced the luminosities and
surface temperatures of the stars (see Section 17-2 and Section
17-4). Figure 18-18b shows all these stars on an H-R diagram.
Note that the hottest and most massive stars, with surface temperatures around 20,000 K, are on
the main sequence. Stars cooler than The H-R diagram of a

now beginning to ignite thermonuclear reactions at their centers.
To find the ages of these stars, we can compare Figure 18-18b
with the theoretical calculations of protostar evolution in Figure
18-10. It turns out that this particular cluster is probably about
2 million years old.
Figure 18-19a shows another young star cluster called the
Pleiades. The photograph shows gas that must once have formed
an H II region around this cluster and has dissipated into interstellar space, leaving only traces of dusty material that forms reflection nebulae around the cluster’s stars. This implies that the
Pleiades must be older than NGC 2264, the cluster in Figure
18-18a, which is still surrounded by an H II region. The H-R diagram for the Pleiades in Figure 18-19b bears out this idea. In
contrast to the H-R diagram for NGC 2264, nearly all the stars
in the Pleiades are on the main sequence. The cluster’s age is
about 50 million years, which is how long it takes for the least
massive stars to finally begin hydrogen fusion in their cores.

process of core hydrogen fusion that characterizes mainsequence stars cannot continue. In Chapter 19 we will see why
massive stars spend a rather short time as main-sequence stars
and will study what happens to stars after the main-sequence
phase of their lives.

A loose collection of stars such as NGC 2264 or the
Pleiades is referred to as an open cluster (or galactic
cluster, since such clusters are usually found in the
plane of the Milky Way Galaxy). Open clusters possess barely
enough mass to hold themselves together by gravitation. Occasionally, a star moving faster than average will escape, or “evaporate,” from an open cluster. Indeed, by the time the stars are a
few billion years old, they may be so widely separated that a cluster no longer exists.

so rapidly that gravitational forces cannot keep them together—
then the group is called a stellar association. Because young stellar associations are typically dominated by luminous O and B
main-sequence stars, they are also called OB associations. The image that opens this chapter shows part of an OB association in
the southern constellation Ara (the Altar).

18-7 Star birth can begin in giant
molecular clouds
We have seen that star formation takes place within dark nebulae. But where within our Galaxy are these dark nebulae found?
Does star formation take place everywhere within the Milky Way,
or only in certain special locations? The answers to such questions can enhance our understanding of star formation and of the
nature of our home Galaxy.

Exploring the Interstellar Medium at
Millimeter Wavelengths
Dark nebulae are a challenge to locate simply because they are
dark—they do not emit visible light. Nearby dark nebulae can be

The Birth of Stars

seen silhouetted against background stars or H II regions (see
Figure 18-2), but sufficiently distant dark nebulae are impossible
to see with visible light because of interstellar extinction. They
can, however, be detected using longer-wavelength radiation that
can pass unaffected through interstellar dust. In fact, dark nebulae actually emit radiation at millimeter wavelengths.
Such emission takes place because in the cold depths of interstellar space, atoms combine to form molecules. The laws of
quantum mechanics predict that just as electrons within atoms
can occupy only certain specific energy levels (see Section 5-8),
molecules can vibrate and rotate
only at certain specific rates. When Observing the Galaxy at
a molecule goes from one vibrational
millimeter wavelengths
state or rotational state to another,
it either emits or absorbs a photon. reveals the cold gas that
(In the same way, an atom emits or spawns new stars
absorbs a photon as an electron
jumps from one energy level to another.) Most molecules are
strong emitters of radiation with wavelengths of around 1 to
10 millimeters (mm). Consequently, observations with radio telescopes tuned to millimeter wavelengths make it possible to detect
interstellar molecules of different types. More than 100 different
kinds of molecules have so far been discovered in interstellar
space, and the list is constantly growing.
Hydrogen is by far the most abundant element in the universe.
Unfortunately, in cold nebulae much of it is in a molecular form
(H2) that is difficult to detect. The reason is that the hydrogen
molecule is symmetric, with two atoms of equal mass joined together, and such molecules do not emit many photons at radio frequencies. In contrast, asymmetric molecules that consist of two
atoms of unequal mass joined together, such as carbon monoxide
(CO), are easily detectable at radio frequencies. When a carbon
monoxide molecule makes a transition from one rate of rotation
to another, it emits a photon at a wavelength of 2.6 mm or shorter.
The ratio of carbon monoxide to hydrogen in interstellar
space is reasonably constant: For every CO molecule, there are
about 10,000 H2 molecules. As a result, carbon monoxide is an
excellent “tracer” for molecular hydrogen gas. Wherever astronomers detect strong emission from CO, they know molecular
hydrogen gas must be abundant.

Giant Molecular Clouds
The first systematic surveys of our Galaxy looking for 2.6-mm
CO radiation were undertaken in 1974 by the American astronomers Philip Solomon and Nicholas Scoville. In mapping the
locations of CO emission, they discovered huge clouds, now called
giant molecular clouds, that must contain enormous amounts of
hydrogen. These clouds have masses in the range of 105 to
2 ⫻ 106 solar masses and diameters that range from about 15 to
100 pc (50 to 300 ly). Inside one of these clouds, there are about
200 hydrogen molecules per cubic centimeter. This is several
thousand times greater than the average density of matter in the
disk of our Galaxy, yet only 10⫺17 as dense as the air we breathe.
Astronomers now estimate that our Galaxy contains about 5000
of these enormous clouds.

Mapping Molecular Clouds A radio telescope was tuned to a

molecules in the constellations Orion and Monoceros. The result was this
false-color map, which shows a 35° ⫻ 40° section of the sky. The Orion
and Horsehead star-forming nebulae are located at sites of intense
CO emission (shown in red and yellow), indicating the presence of a
particularly dense molecular cloud at these sites of star formation. The
molecular cloud is much thinner at the positions of the Cone and Rosette
nebulae, where star formation is less intense. (Courtesy of R. Maddalena,
M. Morris, J. Moscowitz, and P. Thaddeus)

sive areas of the sky covered by giant molecular clouds. This part
of the sky is of particular interest because it includes several starforming regions. By comparing the radio map with the star chart
overlay, you can see that the areas where CO emission is strongest,
and, thus, where giant molecular clouds are densest, are sites of
star formation. Therefore, giant molecular clouds are associated
with the formation of stars. Particularly dense regions within
these clouds form dark nebulae, and within these stars are born.
By using CO emissions to map out giant molecular clouds,
astronomers can find the locations in our Galaxy where star formation occurs. These investigations reveal that molecular clouds
clearly outline our Galaxy’s spiral arms, as Figure 18-21 shows.
These clouds lie roughly 1000 pc (3000 ly) apart and are strung
along the spiral arms like beads on a string. This arrangement resembles the spacing of H II regions along the arms of other spiral galaxies, such as the galaxy shown in Figure 18-8a. The
presence of both molecular clouds and H II regions shows that
spiral arms are sites of ongoing star formation.

Star Formation in Spiral Arms
In Chapter 23 we will learn that spiral arms are locations where
matter “piles up” temporarily as it orbits the center of the Galaxy.

Figure 18-22
You can think of matter in a spiral arm as analogous to a freeway traffic jam. Just as cars are squeezed close together when they
enter a traffic jam, a giant molecular cloud is compressed when it
passes through a spiral arm. When this happens, vigorous star
formation begins in the cloud’s densest regions.
As soon as massive O and B stars form, they emit ultraviolet
light that ionizes the surrounding hydrogen, and an H II region is
born. An H II region is thus a small, bright “hot spot” in a giant
molecular cloud. An example is the Orion Nebula, shown in
Figure 20-1b. Four hot, luminous O and B stars at the heart
of the nebula produce the ionizing radiation that makes the
surrounding gases glow. The Orion Nebula is embedded on the
edge of a giant molecular cloud whose mass is estimated at
500,000 M䉺. The H II regions in Figure 18-2 are located at a different point on the edge of the same molecular cloud, some 25 pc
(80 ly) from the Orion Nebula.
Once star formation has begun and an H II region has formed,
the massive O and B stars at the core of the H II region induce
star formation in the rest of the giant molecular cloud. Ultraviolet radiation and vigorous stellar winds from the O and B stars
carve out a cavity in the cloud, and the H II region, heated by the
stars, expands into it. These winds travel faster than the speed of
sound in the gas—that is, they are supersonic. Just as an airplane
creates a shock wave (a sonic boom) if it flies faster than sound
waves in our atmosphere, a shock wave forms where the expanding H II region pushes at supersonic speed into the rest of the giant molecular cloud. This shock wave compresses the gas through
which it passes, stimulating more star birth (Figure 18-22).
Newborn O and B stars further expand the H II region into
the giant molecular cloud. Meanwhile, the older O and B stars,
which were left behind, begin to disperse (Figure 18-23). In this

R I VUXG

A Star-Forming Bubble Radiation and winds from the hot, young O and
B stars at the center of this Spitzer Space Telescope image have carved

dust. The material around the surface of the bubble has been compressed
and heated, making the dust glow at the infrared wavelengths used to
record this image. The compressed material is so dense that new stars
have formed within that material. This glowing cloud, called RCW 79, lies

way, an OB association “eats into” a giant molecular cloud, leaving stars in its wake.

18-8 Supernovae compress the interstellar
medium and can trigger star birth
Spiral arms are not the only mechanism for triggering the birth of
stars. Presumably, anything that compresses interstellar clouds
will do the job. The most dramatic is a supernova, caused by the
violent death of a massive star after it has left the main sequence.
As we will see in Chapter 20, the core of the doomed star collapses suddenly, releasing vast quantities of particles and energy
that blow the star apart. The star’s outer layers are blasted into
space at speeds of several thousand kilometers per second.

Supernova Remnants and Star Formation
Astronomers have found many nebulae across the sky that are the
shredded funeral shrouds of these dead stars. Such nebulae, like the
one shown in Figure 18-24, are known as supernova remnants.

How O and B Stars Trigger Star Formation Stellar winds and ultraviolet radiation

Chapter 18

Many supernova remnants have a distinctly circular or arched appearance, as would be expected for an expanding shell of gas.
This wall of gas is typically moving away from the dead star
faster than sound waves can travel through the interstellar
medium. As we saw in Section 18-7, such supersonic motion produces a shock wave that abruptly compresses the medium through
which it passes. When a gas is compressed rapidly, its temperature rises, and this temperature rise causes the gas to glow as
shown in Figure 18-24.
When the expanding shell of a supernova remnant slams
into an interstellar cloud, it squeezes the cloud, stimulating star
birth. This kind of star birth is taking place in the stellar association seen in Figure 18-25. This stellar nursery is located
along a luminous arc of gas about 30 pc (100 ly) in length that
is presumably the remnant of an ancient supernova explosion.
In fact, this arc is part of an almost complete ring of glowing
gas with a diameter of about 60 pc (200 ly). Spectroscopic observations of stars along this arc reveal substantial T Tauri activity. This activity results from newborn stars undergoing mass
loss in their final stages of contraction before they become
main-sequence stars.

Supernovae produce a variety of atomic nuclei, including
some that are not produced in any other way. These nuclei are
dispersed into space by the explosion. Some of these telltale nuclei have been discovered in meteorites that have fallen to Earth.
Since meteorites formed very early in the history of our solar system (see Section 8-3), this suggests that a supernova occurred
nearby when our solar system was very young. Some astronomers
have used this idea to propose that
the Sun was once a member of a Our Sun may have
loose stellar association created by a
formed in association
supernova. Individual stellar motions soon carry the stars of such an with a number of other
association in various directions stars
away from their birthplaces. About
4.56 billion years have passed since the birth of our star, so if the
Sun was once part of a stellar association, its brothers and sisters
are now widely scattered across the Galaxy.
Many other processes can also trigger star formation. For example, a collision between two interstellar clouds can create new
stars. Compression occurs at the interface between the two colliding clouds and vigorous star formation follows. Similarly, stellar winds from a group of O and B stars may exert strong enough
pressure on interstellar clouds to cause compression, followed by
star formation. (This process is similar to the one depicted in
Figure 18-23.)

Our understanding of star birth has improved dramatically in recent years, primarily through infrared- and millimeter-wavelength
observations. The Cosmic Connections figure on the next page
summarizes our present state of knowledge about the formation
of stars.
Nevertheless, many puzzles and mysteries remain. One problem is that different modes of star birth tend to produce different
percentages of different kinds of stars. For example, the passage
of a spiral arm through a giant molecular cloud tends to produce
an abundance of massive O and B stars. In contrast, the shock
wave from a supernova seems to produce fewer O and B stars but
many more of the less massive A, F, G, and K stars. We do not
yet know why this is so.
Despite these unanswered questions, it is now clear that star
birth involves mechanisms on a colossal scale, from the deaths of
massive stars to the rotation of an entire galaxy. In many respects,
we have just begun to appreciate these cosmic processes. The
study of cold, dark stellar nurseries will be an active and exciting
area of astronomical research for many years to come.
In the chapters that follow, we will learn that the interstellar medium is both the birthplace of new stars and a dumping
ground for dying stars. At the end of its life, a star can shed
most of its mass in an outburst that enriches interstellar space
with new chemical elements. The interstellar medium is therefore both nursery and graveyard. Because of this intimate relationship with stars, the interstellar medium evolves as successive
generations of stars live out their lives. Understanding the details of this cosmic symbiosis is one of the challenges of modern
astronomy.

If a clump of interstellar matter is cold and dense enough, it will
begin to collapse thanks to the mutual gravitational attraction of
its parts. If the clump is massive enough, it will evolve into a mainsequence star through the sequence of events shown here.

Protostar cores within the dark
nebula

In this cold, dark nebula, gas
atoms and dust particles move so
slowly that gravity can draw them
together.

Gas and dust begin to condense
into clumps, forming the cores of
protostars.

In the T Tauri stage,
the young star
ejects mass into
space in a bipolar
outflow. A stellar
wind blows away
the remaining parts
of the nebula that
surround the star,
exposing the star to
space.

The ejected mass can induce a
shock wave in the surrounding
interstellar material, triggering
the formation of additional stars.

As the cores condense, their
density and temperature both
increase.

As the protostars continue to
heat up and accrete matter
from the nebula, they begin
to glow due to their
increasing temperature.

Once the temperature at the
center of a protostar becomes
sufficiently high, thermonuclear
fusion of hydrogen into helium
begins. The mass that is
continuing to fall onto the star
forms an accretion disk.

Processes that cause the star to lose or gain mass come to an end, and
the star stabilizes as a main-sequence star in hydrostatic equilibrium.
The remnants of the accretion disk may remain as a protoplanetary
disk, from which a system of planets may form around the star.

Key Ideas
Stellar Evolution: Because stars shine by thermonuclear reactions,
they have a finite life span. The theory of stellar evolution describes how stars form and change during that life span.
The Interstellar Medium: Interstellar gas and dust, which make
up the interstellar medium, are concentrated in the disk of the
Galaxy. Clouds within the interstellar medium are called nebulae.
• Dark nebulae are so dense that they are opaque. They appear
as dark blots against a background of distant stars.
• Emission nebulae, or H II regions, are glowing, ionized clouds
of gas. Emission nebulae are powered by ultraviolet light that
they absorb from nearby hot stars.
• Reflection nebulae are produced when starlight is reflected from
dust grains in the interstellar medium, producing a characteristic
bluish glow.
Protostars: Star formation begins in dense, cold nebulae, where
gravitational attraction causes a clump of material to condense
into a protostar.
• As a protostar grows by the gravitational accretion of gases,
Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction causes it to heat and begin glowing. Its relatively low temperature and high luminosity place it in
the upper right region on an H-R diagram.
• Further evolution of a protostar causes it to move toward the
main sequence on the H-R diagram. When its core temperatures
become high enough to ignite steady hydrogen burning, it becomes a main-sequence star.
• The more massive the protostar, the more rapidly it evolves.
Mass Loss by Protostars: In the final stages of pre–main-sequence
contraction, when thermonuclear reactions are about to begin in
its core, a protostar may eject large amounts of gas into space.

• A circumstellar accretion disk provides material that a young
star ejects as jets. Clumps of glowing gas called Herbig-Haro objects are sometimes found along these jets and at their ends.
Star Clusters: Newborn stars may form an open or galactic cluster. Stars are held together in such a cluster by gravity. Occasionally a star moving more rapidly than average will escape, or
“evaporate,” from such a cluster.
• A stellar association is a group of newborn stars that are moving apart so rapidly that their gravitational attraction for one another cannot pull them into orbit about one another.
O and B Stars and Their Relation to H II Regions: The most massive protostars to form out of a dark nebula rapidly become main
sequence O and B stars. They emit strong ultraviolet radiation
that ionizes hydrogen in the surrounding cloud, thus creating the
reddish emission nebulae called H II regions.
• Ultraviolet radiation and stellar winds from the O and B stars
at the core of an H II region create shock waves that move outward through the gas cloud, compressing the gas and triggering
the formation of more protostars.
Giant Molecular Clouds: The spiral arms of our Galaxy are laced
with giant molecular clouds, immense nebulae so cold that their
constituent atoms can form into molecules.
• Star-forming regions appear when a giant molecular cloud is
compressed. This can be caused by the cloud’s passage through
one of the spiral arms of our Galaxy, by a supernova explosion,
or by other mechanisms.

The red stars in this image of open cluster NGC 290 are red
giants, a late stage in stellar evolution. (ESA/NASA/Edward W.
Olszewski, U. of Arizona)

magine a world like Earth, but orbiting a star more than 100
times larger and 2000 times more luminous than our Sun.
Bathed in the star’s intense light, the surface of this world is
utterly dry, airless, and hot enough to melt iron. If you could
somehow survive on the daytime side of this world, you would
see the star filling almost the entire sky.
This bizarre planet is not a creation of science fiction—it is
our own Earth some 7.6 billion years from now. The bloated star
is our own Sun, which in that remote era will have become a redgiant star.
A main-sequence star evolves into a red giant when all the
hydrogen in its core is consumed. The star’s core contracts and
heats up, but its outer layers expand and cool. In the hot, compressed core, helium fusion becomes a new energy source. The
more massive a star, the more rapidly it consumes its core’s hydrogen and the sooner it evolves into a giant.
The interiors of stars are hidden from our direct view, so
much of the story in this chapter is based on theory. We back up
those calculations with observations of star clusters, which contain stars of different masses but roughly the same age. (An ex-

I

ample is the cluster shown here, many of whose stars have evolved
into luminous red giants.) Other observations show that some
red-giant stars actually pulsate, and that stars can evolve along
very different paths if they are part of a binary star system.

19-1 During a star’s main-sequence lifetime,
it expands and becomes more luminous
At the core, main-sequence stars are all fundamentally alike. As
we saw in Section 18-4, it is in their cores that all such stars convert hydrogen into helium by thermonuclear reactions. This
process is called core hydrogen fusion. The total time that a star
will spend fusing hydrogen into helium in its core, and thus the total Over the past 4.56 billion
time that it will spend as a main- years, thermonuclear

fusion has been going on in the Sun’s core for the past 4.56 billion
(4.56  109) years, so our Sun is less than halfway through its
main-sequence lifetime.
What happens to a star like the Sun after the core hydrogen
has been used up, so that it is no longer a main-sequence star? As
we will see, it expands dramatically to become a red giant. To understand why this happens, it is useful to first look at how a star
evolves during its main-sequence lifetime. The nature of that evolution depends on whether its mass is less than or greater than
about 0.4 M䉺.

Main-Sequence Stars of 0.4 M䉺 or Greater:
Consuming Core Hydrogen
A protostar becomes a main-sequence star when steady hydrogen
fusion begins in its core and it achieves hydrostatic equilibrium—
a balance between the inward force of gravity and the outward
pressure produced by hydrogen fusion (see Section 16-2 and
Section 18-4). Such a freshly formed main-sequence star is called
a zero-age main-sequence star.
We make the distinction between “main sequence” and “zeroage main sequence” because a star undergoes noticeable changes
in luminosity, surface temperature, and radius during its mainsequence lifetime. These changes are a result of core hydrogen fusion, which alters the chemical composition of the core. As an example, when our Sun first formed, its composition was the same
at all points throughout its volume: by mass, about 74% hydrogen, 25% helium, and 1% heavy elements. But as Figure 19-1
shows, the Sun’s core now contains a greater mass of helium than
of hydrogen. (There is still enough hydrogen in the Sun’s core for
another 7 billion years or so of core hydrogen fusion.)

CAUTION! Although the outer layers of the Sun are also predominantly hydrogen, there are two reasons why this hydrogen
cannot undergo fusion. The first reason is that while the temperature and pressure in the core are high enough for thermonu-

formed. As the solid curves show, over the past 4.56  109 years,
thermonuclear reactions at the core have depleted hydrogen in the core
and increased the amount of helium in the core.

clear reactions to take place, the temperatures and pressure in
the outer layers are not. The second reason is that there is no
flow of material between the Sun’s core and outer layers, so the
hydrogen in the outer layers cannot move into the hot, highpressure core to undergo fusion. The same is true for mainsequence stars with masses of about 0.4 M䉺 or greater. (We will
see below that the outer layers can undergo fusion in mainsequence stars with a mass less than about 0.4 M䉺.)
Thanks to core hydrogen fusion, the total number of atomic
nuclei in a star’s core decreases with time: In each reaction, four
hydrogen nuclei are converted to a single helium nucleus (see the
Cosmic Connections figure in Section 16-1, as well as Box 16-1).
With fewer particles bouncing around to provide the core’s internal pressure, the core contracts slightly under the weight of the
star’s outer layers. Compression makes the core denser and increases its temperature. (Box 19-1 gives some everyday examples
of how the temperature of a gas changes when it compresses or
expands.) As a result of these changes in density and temperature,
the pressure in the compressed core is actually higher than before.
As the star’s core shrinks, its outer layers expand and shine
more brightly. Here’s why: As the core’s density and temperature
increase, hydrogen nuclei in the core collide with one another
more frequently, and the rate of core hydrogen fusion increases.
Hence, the star’s luminosity increases. The radius of the star as a
whole also increases slightly, because increased core pressure
pushes outward on the star’s outer layers. The star’s surface temperature changes as well, because it is related to the luminosity
and radius (see Section 17-6 and Box 17-4). As an example, theoretical calculations indicate that over the past 4.56  109 years,
our Sun has become 40% more luminous, grown in radius by
6%, and increased in surface temperature by 300 K (Figure 19-2).
As a main-sequence star ages and evolves, the increase in energy outflow from its core also heats the material immediately
surrounding the core. As a result, hydrogen fusion can begin in

The Heavens on the Earth

Compressing and Expanding Gases
s a star evolves, various parts of the star either contract or
expand. When this happens, the gases behave in much the
A
same way as gases here on the Earth when they are forced to
compress or allowed to expand.
When a gas is compressed, its temperature rises. You know
this by personal experience if you have ever had to inflate a bicycle tire with a hand pump. As you pump, the compressed air
gets warm and makes the pump warm to the touch. The same
effect happens on a larger scale in southern California during
Santa Ana winds or downwind from the Rocky Mountains
when there are Chinook winds. Both of these strong winds
blow from the mountains down to the lowlands. Even though
the mountain air is cold, the winds that reach low elevations
can be very hot. (Chinook winds have been known to raise the
temperature by as much as 27°C, or 49°F, in only 2 minutes!)
The explanation is compression. Air blown downhill by the
winds is compressed by the greater air pressure at lower altitudes, and this compression raises the temperature of the air.

Expanding gases tend to drop in temperature. When you
open a bottle of carbonated beverage, the gases trapped in the
bottle expand and cool down. The cooling can be so great that
a little cloud forms within the neck of the bottle. Clouds form
in the atmosphere in the same way. Rising air cools as it goes
to higher altitudes, where the pressure is lower, and the cooling makes water in the air condense into droplets.
Here’s an experiment you can do to feel the cooling of expanding gases. Your breath is actually quite warm, as you can
feel if you open your mouth wide, hold the back of your hand
next to your mouth, and exhale. But if you bring your lips together to form an “o” and again blow on your hand, your
breath feels cool. In the second case, your exhaled breath has
to expand as it passes between your lips to the outside air.
That makes its temperature drop.

for sustained thermonuclear reactions to take place in a star’s
core) and about 0.4 M䉺. These stars, of spectral class M, are
called red dwarfs because they are small in size and have a red
color due to their low surface temperature. They are also very numerous; about 85% of all stars in the Milky Way Galaxy are red
dwarfs.
In a red dwarf, helium does not accumulate in the core to the
same extent as in the Sun’s core. The reason is that in a red dwarf
there are convection cells of rising and falling gas that extend
throughout the star’s volume and penetrate into the core (see
Figure 18-12c). These convection cells drag helium outward from
the core and replace it with hydrogen from the outer layers
(Figure 19-3). The fresh hydrogen can undergo thermonuclear fusion that releases energy and makes additional helium. This helium is then dragged out of the core by convection and replaced
by even more hydrogen from the red dwarf’s outer layers.
As a consequence, over a red dwarf’s main-sequence lifetime
essentially all of the star’s hydrogen can be consumed and converted to helium. The core temperature and pressure in a red
dwarf is less than in the Sun, so thermonuclear reactions happen
more slowly than in our Sun. Calculations indicate that it takes
hundreds of billions of years for a red dwarf to convert all of its
hydrogen completely to helium. The present age of the universe
is only 13.7 billion years, so there has not yet been time for any
red dwarfs to become pure helium.

The Zero-Age Sun and Today’s Sun Over the past 4.56  109 years,

A Star’s Mass Determines Its Main-Sequence Lifetime

much of the hydrogen in the Sun’s core has been converted into helium,
the core has contracted a bit, and the Sun’s luminosity has gone up by
about 40%. These changes in the core have made the Sun’s outer layers
expand in radius by 6% and increased the surface temperature from
5500 K to 5800 K.

The main-sequence lifetime of a star depends critically on its
mass. As Table 19-1 shows, massive stars have short mainsequence lifetimes because they are also very luminous (see Section 17-9, and particularly the Cosmic Connections figure for
Chapter 17). To emit energy so rapidly, these stars must be

stars (see Figure 18-10). In general, the more massive the star, the
more rapidly it goes through all the phases of its life. Still, most
of the stars we are able to detect are in their main-sequence phase,
because this phase lasts so much longer than other luminous
phases.
In the remainder of this chapter we will look at the luminous
phases that can take place after the end of a star’s main-sequence
lifetime. (In Chapters 20, 21, and 22 we will explore the final
phases of a star’s existence, when it ceases to have an appreciable luminosity.)

A Fully Convective Red Dwarf In a red dwarf—a main-sequence star
with less than about 0.4 solar masses—helium (He) created in the core

layers into the core. This process continues until the entire star is helium.

depleting the hydrogen in their cores at a prodigious rate. Hence,
even though a massive O or B main-sequence star contains much
more hydrogen fuel in its core than is in the entire volume of a
red dwarf of spectral class M, the O or B star exhausts its hydrogen much sooner. High-mass O and B stars gobble up the available hydrogen fuel in only a few million years, while red dwarf
stars of very low mass take hundreds of billions of years to use
up their hydrogen. Thus, a main-sequence star’s mass determines
not only its luminosity and spectral type, but also how long it can
remain a main-sequence star (see Box 19-2 for details).
We saw in Section 18-4 how more-massive stars evolve more
quickly through the protostar phase to become main-sequence

Like so many properties of stars, what happens at the end of a
star’s main-sequence lifetime depends on its mass. If the star is a
red dwarf of less than about 0.4 M䉺, after hundreds of billions
of years the star has converted all of its hydrogen to helium. It is
possible for helium to undergo thermonuclear fusion, but this requires temperatures and pressures far higher than those found
within a red dwarf. Thus, a red dwarf will end its life as an inert
ball of helium that still glows due to its internal heat. As it radiates energy into space, it slowly cools and shrinks. This slow,
quiet demise is the ultimate fate of the 85% of stars in the Milky
Way that are red dwarfs. (As we have seen, there has not yet been
time in the history of the universe for any red dwarf to reach this
final stage in its evolution.)
What is the fate of stars more massive than about 0.4 M䉺,
including the Sun? As we will see, the late stages of their evolution are far more dramatic. Studying these stages will give us insight into the fate of our solar system and of life on Earth.

Stars of 0.4 M䉺 or Greater: From Main-Sequence
Star to Red Giant
When a star of at least 0.4 solar masses reaches the end of its
main-sequence lifetime, all of the hydrogen in its core has been
used up and hydrogen fusion ceases there. In this new stage, hydrogen fusion continues only in the hydrogen-rich material just
outside the core, a situation called shell hydrogen fusion. At first,
this process occurs only in the hottest region just outside the core,

Main-Sequence Lifetimes
ydrogen fusion converts a portion of a star’s mass into energy. We can use Einstein’s famous equation relating mass
H
and energy to calculate how long a star will remain on the
main sequence.
Suppose that M is the mass of a star and f is the fraction
of the star’s mass that is converted into energy by hydrogen fusion. The total energy E supplied by the hydrogen fusion can
be expressed as

L
We can carry this analysis further by recalling that mainsequence stars obey the mass-luminosity relation (see Section
17-9, especially the Cosmic Connections figure). The distribution of data on the graph in the Cosmic Connections figure in
Section 17-9 tells us that a star’s luminosity is roughly proportional to the 3.5 power of its mass:

E  fMc2
In this equation c is the speed of light.
This energy from hydrogen fusion is released gradually
over millions or billions of years. If L is the star’s luminosity
(energy released per unit time) and t is the star’s main-sequence
lifetime (the total time over which the hydrogen fusion occurs),
then we can write
E
L 
t
(Actually, this equation is only an approximation. A star’s luminosity is not quite constant over its entire main-sequence
lifetime. But the variations are not important for our purposes.) We can rewrite this equation as
E  Lt
From this equation and E  f Mc 2, we see that
Lt  f Mc 2
We can rearrange this equation as

Thus, a star’s lifetime on the main sequence is proportional to its mass (M) divided by its luminosity (L). Using the
symbol  to denote “is proportional to,” we write

where the hydrogen fuel has not yet been exhausted. Outside this
region, no fusion reactions take place.
Strangely enough, the end of core hydrogen fusion increases
the core’s temperature. When thermonuclear reactions first cease in the In the transition from

heat there. Hence, the core starts to red giant, the star’s core

This approximate relationship can be used to obtain rough
estimates of how long a star will remain on the main sequence.
It is often convenient to relate these estimates to the Sun (a typical 1-M䉺 star), which will spend 1.2  1010 years on the main
sequence.

EXAMPLE: How long will a star whose mass is 4 M䉺 remain
on the main sequence?
Situation: Given the mass of a star, we are asked to
determine its main-sequence lifetime.

Tools: We use the relationship t  1/M2.5.

outward from the core even though no nuclear reactions are taking place there. (Technically, gravitational energy is converted
into thermal energy, as in Kelvin-Helmholtz contraction; see
Section 8-4 and Section 16-1).
This new flow of heat warms the gases around the core, increasing the rate of shell hydrogen fusion and making the shell eat
further outward into the surrounding matter. Helium produced
by reactions in the shell falls down onto the core, which continues

Red Giants (a) The present-day Sun produces energy in a

hydrogen-fusing core about 100,000 km in diameter. Some
7.6 billion years from now, when the Sun becomes a red giant, its energy
source will be a shell only about 30,000 km in diameter within which
hydrogen fusion will take place at a furious rate. The Sun’s luminosity will

to contract and heat up as it gains mass. Over the course of hundreds of millions of years, the core of a 1-M䉺 star compresses to
about one-third of its original radius, while its central temperature increases from about 15 million (1.5  107) K to about
100 million (108) K.
During this post–main-sequence phase, the star’s outer layers
expand just as dramatically as the core contracts. As the hydrogenfusing shell works its way outward, egged on by heat from the
contracting core, the star’s luminosity increases substantially.
This increases the star’s internal pressure and makes the star’s
outer layers expand to many times their original radius. This
tremendous expansion causes those layers to cool down, and the
star’s surface temperature drops (see Box 19-1). Once the temperature of the star’s bloated surface falls to about 3500 K, the gases
glow with a reddish hue, in accordance with Wien’s law (see
Figure 17-7a). The star is then appropriately called a red giant
(Figure 19-4). Thus, we see that red-giant stars are former mainsequence stars that have evolved into a new stage of existence. We
can summarize these observations as a general rule:
Stars join the main sequence when they begin hydrogen fusion
in their cores. They leave the main sequence and become giant
stars when the core hydrogen is depleted.
Red-giant stars undergo substantial mass loss because of their
large diameters and correspondingly weak surface gravity. This
makes it relatively easy for gases to escape from the red giant into

will make the Sun’s outer layers expand to approximately 100 times their

space. Mass loss can be detected in a star’s spectrum, because gas
escaping from a red giant toward a telescope on the Earth produces narrow absorption lines that are slightly blueshifted by the
Doppler effect (review Figure 5-26). Typical observed blueshifts
correspond to a speed of about 10 km/s. A typical red giant loses
roughly 107 M䉺 of matter per year. For comparison, the Sun’s
present-day mass loss rate is only 1014 M䉺 per year. Hence, an
evolving star loses a substantial amount of mass as it becomes a
red giant. Figure 19-5 shows a star losing mass in this way.

The Distant Future of Our Solar System
We can use these ideas to peer into the future of our planet and
our solar system. The Sun’s luminosity will continue to increase
as it goes through its main-sequence lifetime, and the temperature
of the Earth will increase with it. One and a half billion years
from now the Earth’s average surface temperature will be 50°C
(122°F). By 31⁄2 billion years from now the surface temperature
of the Earth will exceed the boiling temperature of water. All the
oceans will boil away, and the Earth will become utterly incapable of supporting life. These increasingly hostile conditions will
pose the ultimate challenge to whatever intelligent beings might
inhabit the Earth in the distant future.
About 7 billion years from now, our Sun will finish converting hydrogen into helium at its core. As the Sun’s core contracts,
its atmosphere will expand to envelop Mercury and perhaps reach
to the orbit of Venus. Roughly 700 million years after leaving the
main sequence, our red-giant Sun will have swollen to a diameter

core is about twice the diameter of the Earth. Most of this core
helium was produced by thermonuclear reactions during the star’s
main-sequence lifetime; during the red-giant era, this helium will
undergo thermonuclear reactions.

Helium, the “ash” of hydrogen fusion, is a potential nuclear fuel:
Helium fusion, the thermonuclear fusion of helium nuclei to make
heavier nuclei, releases energy. But this reaction cannot take place
within the core of our present-day Sun because the temperature
there is too low. Each helium nucleus contains two protons, so it
has twice the positive electric charge of a hydrogen nucleus, and
there is a much stronger electric repulsion between two helium
nuclei than between two hydrogen nuclei. For helium nuclei to
overcome this repulsion and get close enough to fuse together,
they must be moving at very high speeds, which means that the
temperature of the helium gas must be very high. (For more on
the relationship between the temperature of a gas and the speed
of atoms in the gas, see Box 7-2.)
When a star first becomes a red giant, the temperature of the
contracted helium core is still too low for helium nuclei to fuse.
But as the hydrogen-fusing shell adds mass to the helium core, the
core contracts even more, further increasing the star’s central temperature. When the central temperature finally reaches 100 million (108) K, core helium fusion—that is, thermonuclear fusion of
helium in the core—begins. As a result, the aging star again has
a central energy source for the first time since leaving the main
sequence (Figure 19-6c).

radiation from the star, which excites the atoms in the clouds and causes
them to glow. The characteristic red color of the clouds reveals the

outer layers. (David Malin, Anglo–Australian Observatory)

Helium fusion occurs in two steps. First, two helium nuclei

This particular beryllium isotope, which has four protons and
four neutrons, is very unstable and breaks into two helium nuclei
soon after it forms. However, in the star’s dense core a third helium nucleus may strike the 8Be nucleus before it has a chance to
fall apart. Such a collision creates a stable isotope of carbon and
releases energy in the form of a gamma-ray photon ():

This process of fusing three helium nuclei to form a carbon
nucleus is called the triple alpha process, because helium nuclei
(4He) are also called alpha particles by nuclear physicists. Some
of the carbon nuclei created in this process can fuse with an additional helium nucleus to produce a stable isotope of oxygen and
release more energy:
12C

Table 19-2 How Helium Core Fusion Begins
in Different Red Giants

 4He 씮 16O  

Thus, both carbon and oxygen make up the “ash” of helium
fusion. The Cosmic Connections figure summarizes the reactions
involved in helium fusion.
It is interesting to note that 12C and 16O are the most common isotopes of carbon and oxygen, respectively; the vast majority of the carbon atoms in your body are 12C, and almost all the
oxygen you breathe is 16O. We will discuss the significance of this
in Section 19-5.
The second step in the triple alpha process and the process of
oxygen formation both release energy. The onset of these reactions reestablishes thermal equilibrium and prevents any further
gravitational contraction of the star’s core. A mature red giant
fuses helium in its core for a much shorter time than it spent fusing hydrogen in its core as a main-sequence star. For example, in
the distant future the Sun will sustain helium core fusion for only
about 100 million years. (While this is going on, hydrogen fusion
is still continuing in a shell around the core.)

The Helium Flash and Electron Degeneracy
How helium fusion begins at a red giant’s center depends on the
mass of the star. In high-mass red giants (greater than about 2 to
3 M䉺), helium fusion begins gradually as temperatures in the
star’s core approach 108 K. In red giants with a mass less than
about 2 to 3 M䉺, helium fusion begins explosively and suddenly,
in what is called the helium flash. Table 19-2 summarizes these
differences.
The helium flash occurs because of unusual conditions that
develop in the core of a moderately low-mass star as it becomes
a red giant. To appreciate these conditions we must first understand how an ordinary gas behaves. Then we can explore how the
densely packed electrons at the star’s center alter this behavior.
When a gas is compressed, it usually becomes denser and
warmer. To describe this process, scientists use the convenient
concept of an ideal gas, which has a simple relationship between
pressure, temperature, and density. Specifically, the pressure ex-

erted by an ideal gas is directly proportional to both the density
and the temperature of the gas. Many real gases actually behave
like an ideal gas over a wide range of temperatures and densities.
Under most circumstances, the gases inside a star act like an
ideal gas. If the gas expands, it cools down, and if it is compressed, it heats up (see Box 19-1). This behavior serves as a
safety valve, ensuring that the star remains in thermal equilibrium
(see Section 16-2). For example, if the rate of thermonuclear reactions in the star’s core should increase, the additional energy releases heat and expands the core. This cools the core’s gases and
slows the rate of thermonuclear reactions back to the original
value. Conversely, if the rate of thermonuclear reactions should
decrease, the core will cool down and compress under the pressure of the overlying layers. The compression of the core will
make its temperature increase, thus speeding up the thermonuclear reactions and returning them to their original rate.
In a red giant with a mass between about 0.4 M䉺 and 2-3 M䉺,
however, the core behaves very differently from an ideal gas. The
core must be compressed tremendously in order to become hot
enough for helium fusion to begin. At these extreme pressures and
temperatures, the atoms are completely ionized, and most of the
core consists of nuclei and detached
electrons. Eventually, the free elec- Before helium fusion

begins in a red giant’s
that a limit to further compression is
reached, as predicted by a remark- core, the helium gas
able law of quantum mechanics there behaves like a
called the Pauli exclusion principle. metal
Formulated in 1925 by the Austrian
physicist Wolfgang Pauli, this principle states that two electrons
cannot simultaneously occupy the same quantum state. A quantum state is a particular set of circumstances concerning locations
and speeds that are available to a particle. In the submicroscopic
world of electrons, the Pauli exclusion principle is analogous to
saying that you can’t have two things in the same place at the
same time.
Just before the onset of helium fusion, the electrons in the
core of a low-mass star are so closely crowded together that any
further compression would violate the Pauli exclusion principle.
Because the electrons cannot be squeezed any closer together, they
produce a powerful pressure that resists further core contraction.
This phenomenon, in which closely packed particles resist
compression as a consequence of the Pauli exclusion principle,
is called degeneracy. Astronomers say that the electrons in the
helium-rich core of a low-mass red giant are “degenerate,” and

A star becomes a red giant after the fusion of hydrogen into helium
in its core has come to an end. As the red giant’s core shrinks and
heats up, a new cycle of reactions can occur that create the even
heavier elements carbon and oxygen.

pressures become high enough for helium nuclei (4He) to

the explosive drama of the helium flash takes place where it cannot be seen directly.

The Continuing Evolution of a Red Giant

RI V UXG

Degenerate Electrons The electrons in an ordinary piece of metal, like
the chrome grille on this classic car, are so close together that they are
affected by the Pauli exclusion principle. The resulting degenerate
electron pressure helps make metals strong and difficult to compress. A
more powerful version of this same effect happens inside the cores of
low-mass red-giant stars. (Santokh Kochar/PhotoDisc)

that the core is supported by degenerate-electron pressure. This
degenerate pressure, unlike the pressure of an ideal gas, does not
depend on temperature. Remarkably, you can find degenerate
electrons on Earth in an ordinary piece of metal (Figure 19-7).
When the temperature in the core of a low-mass red giant
reaches the high level required for the triple alpha process, energy
begins to be released. The helium heats up, which makes the triple
alpha process happen even faster. However, the pressure provided
by the degenerate electrons is independent of the temperature, so
the pressure does not change. Without the “safety valve” of increasing pressure, the star’s core cannot expand and cool. The rising temperature causes the helium to fuse at an ever-increasing
rate, producing the helium flash.
Eventually, the temperature becomes so high that the electrons in the core are no longer degenerate. The electrons then behave like an ideal gas and the star’s core expands, terminating the
helium flash. These events occur so rapidly that the helium flash
is over in seconds, after which the star’s core settles down to a
steady rate of helium fusion.

CAUTION! The term “helium flash” might give you the impression that a star emits a sudden flash of light when the helium flash occurs. If this were true, it would be an incredible
sight. During the brief time interval when the helium flash occurs, the helium-fusing core is 1011 times more luminous than
the present-day Sun, comparable to the total luminosity of all
the stars in the Milky Way Galaxy! But, in fact, the helium flash
has no immediately visible consequences—for two reasons. First,
much of the energy released during the helium flash goes into
heating the core and terminating the degenerate state of the electrons. Second, the energy that does escape the core is largely absorbed by the star’s outer layers, which are quite opaque (just

Luminosity of the Sun
(compared to the present-day value)

Figure 19-7

Whether a helium flash occurs or not, the onset of core helium
fusion actually causes a decrease in the luminosity of the star.
This is the opposite of what you might expect—after all, turning
on a new energy source should make the luminosity greater, not
less. What happens is that after the onset of core helium fusion,
a star’s superheated core expands like an ideal gas. (If the star is
of sufficiently low mass to have had a degenerate core, the increased temperature after the helium flash makes the core too hot
to remain degenerate. Hence, these stars also end up with cores
that behave like ideal gases.) Temperatures drop around the expanding core, so the hydrogen-fusing shell reduces its energy output and the star’s luminosity decreases. This allows the star’s
outer layers to contract and heat up. Consequently, a post–
helium-flash star is less luminous, hotter at the surface, and smaller
than a red giant.
Core helium fusion lasts for only a relatively short time. Calculations suggest that a 1-M䉺 star like the Sun sustains core

Figure 19-8
Stages in the Evolution of the Sun This diagram shows how the
luminosity of the Sun (a 1-M䉺 star) changes over time. The Sun began
as a protostar whose luminosity decreased rapidly as the protostar
contracted. Once established as a main-sequence star with core hydrogen
fusion, the Sun’s luminosity increases slowly over billions of years. The
post–main-sequence evolution is much more rapid, so a different time
scale is used in the right-hand portion of the graph. (Adapted from Mark A.

hydrogen fusion for about 12 billion (1.2  1010) years, followed
by about 250 million (2.5  108) years of shell hydrogen fusion
leading up to the helium flash. After the helium flash, such a star
can fuse helium in its core (while simultaneously fusing hydrogen
in a shell around the core) for only 100 million (108) years, a
mere 1% of its main-sequence lifetime. Figure 19-8 summarizes
these evolutionary stages in the life of a 1-M䉺 star. In Chapter 20
we will take up the story of what happens after a star has consumed all the helium in its core.
Here is the story of post–main-sequence evolution in its
briefest form: Before the beginning of core helium fusion, the
star’s core compresses and the outer layers expand, and just after
core helium fusion begins, the core expands and the outer layers
compress. We will see in Chapter 20 that this behavior, in which
the inner and outer regions of the star change in opposite ways,
occurs again and again in the final stages of a star’s evolution.

19-4 H-R diagrams and observations of star
clusters reveal how red giants evolve
To see how stars evolve during and after their main-sequence lifetimes, it is helpful to follow them on a Hertzsprung-Russell

507

(H-R) diagram. On such a diagram, zero-age main-sequence stars
lie along a line called the zero-age main sequence, or ZAMS
(Figure 19-9a). These stars have just emerged from their protostar stage, are steadily fusing hydrogen into helium in their cores,
and have attained hydrostatic equilibrium. With the passage of
time, hydrogen in a main-sequence star’s core is converted to helium, the luminosity slowly increases, the star slowly expands,
and the star’s position on the H-R diagram inches away from the
ZAMS. As a result, the main sequence on an H-R diagram is a
fairly broad band rather than a narrow line (Figure 19-9b).

Post–Main-Sequence Evolution on an H-R Diagram
The dashed line in Figure 19-9a denotes stars whose cores have
been exhausted of hydrogen and in which core hydrogen fusion
has ceased. These stars have reached the ends of their mainsequence lifetimes. From there, the points representing highmass stars (3 M䉺, 5 M䉺, and 9 M䉺) move rapidly from left to
right across the H-R diagram. This means that, although the
star’s surface temperature is decreasing, its surface area is increasing at a rate that keeps its overall luminosity roughly constant. During this transition, the star’s core contracts and its
outer layers expand as energy flows outward from the hydrogenfusing shell.

Chapter 19

Just before core helium fusion begins, the evolutionary tracks
of high-mass stars turn upward in the red-giant region of the
H-R diagram (to the upper right of the main sequence). After core
helium fusion begins, however, the cores of these stars expand,
the outer layers contract, and the evolutionary tracks back away
from these temporary peak luminosities. The tracks then wander
back and forth in the red-giant region while the stars readjust to
their new energy sources.
Figure 19-9a also shows the evolutionary tracks of two stars
of moderately low mass (1 M䉺 and 2 M䉺). The onset of core helium fusion in these stars occurs with a helium flash, indicated by
the red asterisks in the figure. As we saw in the previous section,
after the helium flash, these stars shrink and become less luminous. The decrease in size is proportionately greater than the decrease in luminosity, and so the surface temperatures increase.
Hence, after the helium flash, the evolutionary tracks for the
1-M䉺 and 2-M䉺 stars move down and to the left.

Years of Stellar Evolution

Real Star Clusters: Cluster Ages and Turnoff Points
BL

INK 1

The evolution of the hypothetical cluster displayed in
Figure 19-10 helps us interpret what we see in actual
star clusters. We can observe the early stages of stellar
evolution in open clusters, which typically contain a few hundred
to a few thousand stars. Many open clusters are just a few million years old, so their H-R diagrams resemble Figure 19-10d,
19-10e, or 19-10f (see Section 18-6, especially Figure 18-18 and
Figure 18-19).
Figure 19-11 shows two open clusters of different ages. The
nearer cluster, called M35, must be relatively young because it
contains several dozen luminous, blue, high-mass main-sequence
stars. These stars lie in the upper
part of the main sequence on an As a cluster ages and its
H-R diagram. They have mainstars end their
sequence lifetimes of only a few hundred million years, so M35 can be main-sequence lifetimes,
no older than that. Some of the most the cluster’s color
luminous stars in M35 are red or changes from blue to red
yellow in color; these are stars that
ended their main-sequence lifetimes some time ago and have
evolved into red giants. The H-R diagram for this cluster resembles Figure 19-10g.
There are no high-mass blue main-sequence stars at all in
NGC 2158, the more distant cluster shown in Figure 19-11. Any
such stars that were once in NGC 2158 have long since come to
the end of their main-sequence lifetimes. As a result, the main sequence in this cluster has been “eaten away” more than that of
M35, leaving only stars that are yellow or red in color. This tells
us that NGC 2158 must be older than M35 (compare Figures
9.4

We can summarize our understanding of stellar evolution from
birth through the onset of helium fusion by following the evolution of a hypothetical cluster of stars. We saw in Section 18-6 that
the stars that make up a cluster all begin to form at essentially the
same time but have different initial masses. Hence, studying star
clusters allows us to compare how stars of different masses evolve.
The eight H-R diagrams in Figure 19-10 are from a computer
simulation of the evolution of 100 stars that all form at the same
moment and differ only in initial mass. All 100 stars begin as cool
protostars on the right side of the H-R diagram (see Figure
19-10a). The protostars are spread out on the diagram according
to their masses, and the greater the mass, the greater the protostar’s initial luminosity. As we saw in Section 18-3, the source of
a protostar’s luminosity is its gravitational energy. As the protostar contracts, this is converted to thermal energy and radiated
into space.
The most massive protostars contract and heat up very rapidly.
After only 5000 years, they have already moved across the H-R
diagram toward the main sequence (see Figure 19-10b). After
100,000 years, these massive stars have ignited hydrogen fusion
in their cores and have settled down on the main sequence as O
stars (see Figure 19-10c). After 3 million years, stars of moderate
mass have also ignited core hydrogen fusion and become mainsequence stars of spectral classes B and A (see Figure 19-10d).
Meanwhile, low-mass protostars continue to inch their way toward the main sequence as they leisurely contract and heat up.
After 30 million years (see Figure 19-10e), the most massive
stars have depleted the hydrogen in their cores and become red
giants. These stars have moved from the upper left end of the
main sequence to the upper right corner of the H-R diagram.
(This simulation follows stars only to the red-giant stage, after
which they are simply deleted from the diagram.) Intermediatemass stars lie on the main sequence, while the lowest-mass stars
are still in the protostar stage and lie above the main sequence.
After 66 million years (see Figure 19-10f ), even the lowestmass protostars have finally ignited core hydrogen fusion and

have settled down on the main sequence as cool, dim, M stars.
These lowest-mass stars can continue to fuse hydrogen in their
cores for hundreds of billions of years.
In the final two H-R diagrams (Figures 19-10g and 19-10h),
the main sequence gets “eaten away” from the upper left to
the lower right as stars exhaust their core supplies of hydrogen
and evolve into red giants. The stars that leave the main sequence between Figure 19-10g and Figure 19-10h have masses
between about 1 M䉺 and 3 M䉺 and undergo the helium flash
in their cores.
For all stars in this simulation, the giant stage lasts only a
brief time compared to the star’s main-sequence lifetime. Compared to a 1-M䉺 star (see Figure 19-8), a more massive star has
a shorter main-sequence lifetime and spends a shorter time as a
giant star. Thus, at any given time, only a small fraction of the
stellar population is passing through the giant stage. Hence, most
of the stars we can see through telescopes are main-sequence
stars. As an example, of the stars within 4.00 pc (13.05 ly) of the
Sun listed in Appendix 4, only one—Procyon A—is presently
evolving from a main-sequence star into a giant. Two other nearby
stars are white dwarfs, an even later stage in stellar evolution that
we will discuss in Chapter 20. (By contrast, most of the brightest
stars listed in Appendix 5 are giants and supergiants. Although
they make up only a small fraction of the stellar population, these
stars stand out due to their extreme luminosity.)

Chapter 19

Such a color-magnitude diagram for a cluster is equivalent to an
H-R diagram. The color ratio of a star tells you its surface temperature (as described in Section 17-4), and because all the stars
in the cluster are at essentially the same distance from us, their
relative brightnesses indicate their relative luminosities. What you
would discover is that a globular cluster’s main sequence has been
“eaten away” even more extensively than the open cluster NGC
2158 in Figure 19-11. Hence, globular clusters must be even older
than NGC 2158. In a typical globular cluster, all the mainsequence stars with masses more than about 1M䉺 or 2 M䉺 evolved
long ago into red giants. Only low-mass, slowly evolving stars
still have core hydrogen fusion. (Compare Figure 19-13 with
Figure 19-10h.)

well as a few red giants. Hence its H-R diagram resembles that shown in
Figure 19-10g, and its age is around 100 million years (more accurately,
around 150 million). The more distant cluster, NGC 2158, has no blue
main-sequence stars; long ago, all of these massive stars came to the
end of their main-sequence lifetimes and became giants. The H-R
diagram for NGC 2158 is intermediate between Figure 19-10g and Figure

We can see even later stages in stellar evolution by
studying globular clusters, so called because of their
spherical shape. A typical globular cluster contains up
to 1 million stars in a volume less than 100 parsecs across
(Figure 19-12). Among these are many highly evolved post–mainsequence stars.
Globular clusters must be old, because they contain no highmass main-sequence stars. To show this, you would measure the
apparent magnitude (a measure of apparent brightness, which we
introduced in Section 17-3) and color ratio of many stars in a
globular cluster, then plot the data as shown in Figure 19-13.

ing: There are luminous blue stars in the ancient globular cluster M10. This seems to contradict our earlier statements that
blue main-sequence stars evolve into red giants after just a few
hundred million years. The explanation is that these are not
main-sequence stars, but rather horizontal-branch stars. These
stars get their name because in the color-magnitude diagram of
a globular cluster, they form a horizontal grouping in the leftof-center portion of the diagram (see Figure 19-13). Horizontalbranch stars are relatively low-mass stars that have already
become red giants and undergone a helium flash, so there is
both core helium fusion and shell hydrogen fusion taking place
in their interiors. After the helium flash their luminosity decreased to about 50 L䉺 (compared to about 1000 L䉺 before the
flash) and their outer layers contracted and heated, giving these
stars their blue color. In years to come, these stars will move
back toward the red-giant region as their fuel is devoured. Our
own Sun will go through a horizontal-branch phase in the distant future; this is the phase labeled by the number 3 at the far
right of Figure 19-8.

Measuring the Ages of Star Clusters
The idea that a cluster’s main sequence is progressively “eaten
away” is the key to determining the age of a cluster. In the H-R
diagram for a very young cluster, all the stars are on or near the
main sequence. (An example is the open cluster NGC 2264, shown
in Figure 18-18.) As a cluster gets older, however, stars begin to
leave the main sequence. The high-mass, high-luminosity stars are
the first to consume their core hydrogen and become red giants.
As time passes the main sequence gets shorter and shorter, like a
candle burning down (see parts d through h of Figure 19-10).
The age of a cluster can be found from the turnoff point,
which is the top of the surviving portion of the main sequence on
the cluster’s H-R diagram (see Figure 19-13). The stars at the
turnoff point are just now exhausting the hydrogen in their cores,
so their main-sequence lifetime is equal to the age of the cluster.
For example, in the case of the globular cluster M55 plotted in
Figure 19-13, 0.8-M䉺 stars have just left the main sequence, indicating that the cluster’s age is more than 12 billion (1.2  1010)
years (see Table 19-1).
Figure 19-14 shows data for several star clusters plotted on
a single H-R diagram. This graph also shows turnoff-point times
from which the ages of the clusters can be estimated.

Chapter 19

19-5 Stellar evolution has produced two
distinct populations of stars
Studies of star clusters reveal a curious difference between the
youngest and oldest stars in our Galaxy. Stars in the youngest
clusters (those with most of their main sequences still intact) are
said to be metal rich, because their spectra contain many prominent spectral lines of heavy elements. (Recall from Section 17-5
that astronomers use the term “metal” to denote any element
other than hydrogen and helium, which are the two lightest elements.) Such stars are also called Population I stars. The Sun is a
relatively young, metal-rich, Population I star.
By contrast, the spectra of stars in the oldest clusters show
only weak lines of heavy elements. These ancient stars are thus
said to be metal poor, because heavy elements are only about 3%
as abundant in these stars as in the Sun. They are also called Population II stars. The stars in globular clusters are metal poor, Population II stars. Figure 19-15 shows the difference in spectra
between a metal-poor, Population II star and the Sun (a metalrich, Population I star).

CAUTION! Note that “metal rich” and “metal poor” are relative terms. In even the most metal-rich star known, metals make
up just a few percent of the total mass of the star.

Stellar Populations and the Origin of Heavy Elements
To explain why there are two distinct populations of stars, we
must go back to the Big Bang, the explosive origin of the universe
that took place some 13.7 billion years ago. As we will discuss in
Chapter 27, the early universe consisted almost exclusively of hydrogen and helium, with almost no heavy elements (metals). The
first stars to form were likewise metal poor. The least massive of

Hδ

these have survived to the present day and are now the ancient
stars of Population II.
The more massive of the original stars evolved more rapidly
and no longer shine. But as these stars evolved, helium fusion in
their cores produced metals—carbon and oxygen. In the most
massive stars, as we will learn in
Chapter 21, further thermonuclear Stars like the Sun contain
reactions produced even heavier elematerial that was

stars aged and died, they expelled processed through an

(The star shown in Figure 19-5 is stars
going through such a mass-loss
phase late in its life.) This expelled material joined the interstellar medium and was eventually incorporated into a second generation of stars that have a higher concentration of heavy elements.
These metal-rich members of the second stellar generation are the
Population I stars, of which our Sun is an example.

CAUTION! Be careful not to let the designations of the two
stellar populations confuse you. Population I stars are members
of a second stellar generation, while Population II stars belong
to an older first generation.
The relatively high concentration of heavy elements in the
Sun means that the solar nebula, from which both the Sun and
planets formed (see Section 8-4), must likewise have been metal
rich. The Earth is composed almost entirely of heavy elements, as
are our bodies. Thus, our very existence is intimately linked to the
Sun’s being a Population I star. A planet like the Earth probably
could not have formed from the metal-poor gases that went into
making Population II stars.

The spectrum of this Population II star shows absorption lines
of hydrogen (such as Hγ and Hδ) but only very weak absorption
lines of metals … such a star is metal-poor.

Stellar Evolution: On and After the Main Sequence

The concept of two stellar populations provides insight into
our own origins. Recall from Section 19-3 that helium fusion in
red-giant stars produces the same isotopes of carbon (12C) and
oxygen (16O) that are found most commonly on the Earth. The
reason is that the Earth’s carbon and oxygen atoms, including all
of those in your body, actually were produced by helium fusion.
These reactions occurred billions of years ago within an earlier
generation of stars that died and gave up their atoms to the interstellar medium—the same atoms that later became part of our solar system, our planet, and our bodies. We are literally children
of the stars.

We saw in Section 16-3 that the surface of our Sun vibrates in and out, although by only a small amount.
But other stars undergo substantial changes in size, alternately swelling and shrinking. As these stars pulsate, they also
vary dramatically in brightness. We now understand that these
pulsating variable stars are actually evolved, post–main-sequence
stars.

Long-Period Variables
Pulsating variable stars were first discovered in 1595 by David
Fabricius, a Dutch minister and amateur astronomer. He noticed
that the star ␱ (omicron) Ceti is sometimes bright enough to be
easily seen with the naked eye but at other times fades to invisibility (Figure 19-16). By 1660, astronomers realized that these bright-

are found in the upper right of the H-R diagram. Long-period
variables like Mira are cool red giant stars that pulsate slowly, changing
their brightness in a semi-regular fashion over months or years. Cepheid
variables and RR Lyrae variables are located in the instability strip, which
lies between the main sequence and the red-giant region. A star passing
through this strip along its evolutionary track becomes unstable and
pulsates.

Mira—A Long-Period Variable Star Mira, or ␱ (omicron)
Ceti, is a variable star whose luminosity varies with a
332-day period. At its dimmest, as in (a) (photographed in December
1961), Mira is less than 1% as bright as when it is at maximum, as in
(b) (January 1965). These brightness variations occur because Mira

ness variations repeated with a period of 332 days. Seventeenthcentury astronomers were so enthralled by this variable star that
they renamed it Mira (“wonderful”).
Mira is an example of a class of pulsating stars called longperiod variables. These stars are cool red giants that vary in
brightness by a factor of 100 or more over a period of months or
years. With surface temperatures of about 3500 K and average luminosities that range from about 10 to 10,000 L䉺, they occupy
the upper right side of the H-R diagram (Figure 19-17). Some,
like Mira, are periodic, but others are irregular. Many eject large
amounts of gas and dust into space.
Astronomers do not fully understand why some cool red giants become long-period variables. It is difficult to calculate accurate stellar models to describe such huge stars with extended,
tenuous atmospheres.

Cepheid Variables
Astronomers have a much better understanding of other pulsating stars, called Cepheid variables, or simply Cepheids. A Cepheid
variable is recognized by the characteristic way in which its light
output varies—rapid brightening followed by gradual dimming.
They are named for  (delta) Cephei,

covered in 1784 by John Goodricke,
stars, astronomers gain
a deaf, mute, 19-year-old English
amateur astronomer. He found that insight into late stages
at its most brilliant,  Cephei is 2.3 of stellar evolution
times as bright as at its dimmest. The
cycle of brightness variations repeats every 5.4 days. (Sadly,
Goodricke paid for his discoveries with his life; he caught pneumonia while making his nightly observations and died before his
twenty-second birthday.) The surface temperatures and luminosities of the Cepheid variables place them in the upper middle of
the H-R diagram (see Figure 19-17).

After core helium fusion begins, mature stars move across the
middle of the H-R diagram. Figure 19-9a shows the evolutionary
tracks of high-mass stars crisscrossing the H-R diagram. Post–
helium-flash stars of moderate mass also cross the middle of the
H-R diagram between the red-giant region and the horizontal
branch.
During these transitions across the H-R diagram, a star can
become unstable and pulsate. In fact, there is a region on the
H-R diagram between the upper main sequence and the red-giant
branch called the instability strip (see Figure 19-17). When an
evolving star passes through this region, the star pulsates and its
brightness varies periodically. Figure 19-18a shows the brightness
variations of  Cephei, which lies within the instability strip.
A Cepheid variable brightens and fades because the star’s
outer envelope cyclically expands and contracts. The first to observe this was the Russian astronomer Aristarkh Belopol’skii,
who noticed in 1894 that spectral lines in the spectrum of 
Cephei shift back and forth with the same 5.4-day period as that
of the magnitude variations. From the Doppler effect, we can

translate these wavelength shifts into radial velocities and draw a
velocity curve (Figure 19-18b). Negative velocities mean that the
star’s surface is expanding toward us; positive velocities mean
that the star’s surface is receding. Note that the light curve and
velocity curve are mirror images of each other. The star is brighter
than average while it is expanding and dimmer than average while
contracting.
When a Cepheid variable pulsates, the star’s surface oscillates
up and down like a spring. During these cyclical expansions and
contractions, the star’s gases alternately heat up and cool down.
Figure 19-18c shows the resulting changes in the star’s surface
temperature. Figure 19-18d graphs the periodic changes in the
star’s diameter.
Just as a bouncing ball eventually comes to rest, a pulsating
star would soon stop pulsating without something to keep its oscillations going. In 1914, the British astronomer Arthur Eddington suggested that a Cepheid pulsates because the star is more
opaque when compressed than when expanded. When the star is
compressed, trapped heat increases the internal pressure, which
pushes the star’s surface outward. When the star expands, the
heat escapes, the internal pressure drops, and the star’s surface
falls inward.
In the 1960s, the American astronomer John Cox followed up
on Eddington’s idea and proved that helium is what keeps Cepheids
pulsating. Normally, when a star’s helium is compressed, the gas
increases in temperature and becomes more transparent. But in
certain layers near the star’s surface, compression may ionize helium (remove one of its electrons) instead of raising its temperature. Ionized helium gas is quite opaque, so these layers effectively
trap heat and make the star expand, as Eddington suggested. This
expansion cools the outer layers and makes the helium ions recombine with electrons, which makes the gas more transparent and releases the trapped energy. The star’s surface then falls inward,
recompressing the helium, and the cycle begins all over again.

remote objects. First, Cepheids can be seen even at distances of
millions of parsecs. This is because they are very luminous, ranging from a few hundred times solar luminosity to more than
104 L䉺. Second, there is a direct relationship between a Cepheid’s
period and its average luminosity: The dimmest Cepheid variables
pulsate rapidly, with periods of 1 to 2 days, while the most luminous Cepheids pulsate with much slower periods of about
100 days.
Figure 19-19 shows this period-luminosity relation. By measuring the period of a distant Cepheid’s brightness variations and
using a graph like Figure 19-19, an astronomer can determine the
star’s luminosity. By also measuring the star’s apparent brightness, the distance to the Cepheid can be found by using the
inverse-square law (see Section 17-2). By applying the periodluminosity relation in this way to Cepheids in other galaxies, astronomers have been able to calculate the distances to those galaxies with great accuracy. (Box 17-2 gives an example of such a
calculation.) As we will see in Chapters 24 and 26, such measurements play an important role in determining the overall size and
structure of the universe.
How a Cepheid pulsates depends on the amount of heavy elements in the star’s outer layers, because even trace amounts of
these elements can have a large effect on how opaque the stellar
gases are. Hence, Cepheids are classified according to their metal
content. If the star is a metal-rich, Population I star, it is called a
Type I Cepheid; if it is a metal-poor, Population II star, it is called

Cepheid variables are important because they have two properties that allow astronomers to determine the distances to very

Luminosity (L )

CAUTION! In our discussion of the behavior of gases (see Box
19-1, Section 19-1, and Section 19-3) we saw that a gas cools
when it expands and heats up when it is compressed. Hence,
you would expect that the gases in a pulsating star like  Cephei
would reach their maximum temperature when the star is at its
smallest diameter, so that the gases are most compressed. The
hotter the gas, the more brightly it glows, so  Cephei should
also have its maximum brightness when its diameter is smallest.
But Figure 19-18 shows that the star’s brightness and the temperature of the gases at the surface reach their maximum values
when the star is expanding, some time after the star has contracted to its smallest diameter. How can this be? The explanation is again related to how opaque the gases are inside the star.
The rate at which energy is emitted from the central regions of
the star is indeed greatest when the star is at its minimum diameter, but the opaque gases in the star’s outer layers impede the
flow of energy to the surface. Hence,  Cephei reaches its maximum brightness and maximum surface temperature about half
a day after the star is at its smallest size.

Period-Luminosity Relations for Cepheids The greater the

a Type II Cepheid. As Figure 19-19 shows, these two types of
Cepheids exhibit different period-luminosity relations. In order to
know which period-luminosity relation to apply to a given
Cepheid, an astronomer must determine the star’s metal content
from its spectrum (see Figure 19-15).
The evolutionary tracks of mature, high-mass stars pass back
and forth through the upper end of the instability strip on the
H-R diagram. These stars become Cepheids when helium ionization occurs at just the right depth to drive the pulsations. For stars
on the high-temperature (left) side of the instability strip, helium
ionization occurs too close to the surface and involves only an insignificant fraction of the star’s mass. For stars on the cool (right)
side of the instability strip, convection in the star’s outer layers
prevents the storage of the energy needed to drive the pulsations.
Thus, Cepheids exist only in a narrow temperature range on the
H-R diagram.

RR Lyrae Variables
Stars of lower mass do not become Cepheids. Instead, after leaving the main sequence, becoming red giants, and undergoing the
helium flash, their evolutionary tracks pass through the lower end
of the instability strip as they move along the horizontal branch.
Some of these stars become RR Lyrae variables, named for their
prototype in the constellation Lyra (the Harp). RR Lyrae variables all have periods shorter than one day and roughly the same
average luminosity as horizontal-branch stars, about 100 L䉺. In
fact, the RR Lyrae region of the instability strip (see Figure
19-17) is actually a segment of the horizontal branch. RR Lyrae
stars are all metal-poor, Population II stars. Many have been
found in globular clusters, and they have been used to determine
the distances to those clusters in the same way that Cepheids are
used to find the distances to other galaxies. In Chapter 23 we will
see how RR Lyrae stars helped astronomers determine the size of
the Milky Way Galaxy.
In some cases the expansion speed of a pulsating star exceeds
the star’s escape speed. When this happens, the star’s outer layers
are ejected completely. We will see in Chapter 20 that dying stars
eject significant amounts of mass in this way, renewing and enriching the interstellar medium for future generations of stars.

19-7 Mass transfer can affect the evolution
of stars in a close binary system
We have outlined what happens when a main-sequence star
evolves into a red giant. What we have ignored is that more than
half of all stars are members of multiple-star systems, including
binaries. If the stars in such a system are widely separated, the individual stars follow the same course of evolution as if they were
isolated. In a close binary, however, when one star expands to become a red giant, its outer layers can be gravitationally captured
by the nearby companion star. In other words, a bloated red giant in a close binary system can dump gas onto its companion, a
process called mass transfer.

Roche Lobes and Lagrangian Points
Our modern understanding of mass transfer in close binaries is
based on the work of the French mathematician Edouard Roche.
In the mid-1800s, Roche studied
how rotation and mutual tidal inter- If the stars in a binary
action affect the stars in a binary sys- system are sufficiently
tem. Tidal forces cause the two stars
close, tidal forces can
in a close binary to keep the same
sides facing each other, just as our pull gases off one star
Moon keeps its same side facing the and onto the other
Earth (see Section 4-8). But because
stars are gaseous, not solid, rotation and tidal forces can have significant effects on their shapes.
In widely separated binaries, the stars are so far apart that
tidal effects are small, and, therefore, the stars are nearly perfect
spheres. In close binaries, where the separation between the stars
is not much greater than their sizes, tidal effects are strong, causing the stars to be somewhat egg-shaped.
Roche discovered a mathematical surface that marks the gravitational domain of each star in a close binary. (This is not a real
physical surface, like the surface of a balloon, but a mathematical construct.) Figure 19-20a shows the outline of this surface as
a dashed line. The two halves of this surface, each of which encloses one of the stars, are known as Roche lobes. The more massive star is always located inside the larger Roche lobe. If gas from
a star leaks over its Roche lobe, it is no longer bound by gravity
to that star. This escaped gas is free either to fall onto the companion star or to escape from the binary system.
The point where the two Roche lobes touch, called the inner
Lagrangian point, is a kind of balance point between the two
stars in a binary. It is here that the effects of gravity and rotation
cancel each other. When mass transfer occurs in a close binary,
gases flow through the inner Lagrangian point from one star to
the other.
In many binaries, the stars are so far apart that even during
their red-giant stages the surfaces of the stars remain well inside
their Roche lobes. As a result, little mass transfer can occur and
each star lives out its life as if it were single and isolated. A binary system of this kind is called a detached binary (Figure
19-20a).
However, if the two stars are close enough, when one star expands to become a red giant, it may fill or overflow its Roche
lobe. Such a system is called a semidetached binary (Figure
19-20b). If both stars fill their Roche lobes, the two stars actually
touch and the system is called a contact binary (Figure 19-20c).
It is quite unlikely, however, that both stars exactly fill their
Roche lobes at the same time. (This would only be the case if the
two stars had identical masses, so that they both evolved at exactly the same rate.) It is more likely that they overflow their
Roche lobes, giving rise to a common envelope of gas. Such a system is called an overcontact binary (Figure 19-20d).

Observations of Mass Transfer
The binary star system Algol (from an Arabic term for “demon”)
provided the first clear evidence of mass transfer in close binaries.
Also called (beta) Persei, Algol can easily be seen with the naked

eye. Ancient astronomers knew that Algol varies periodically in
brightness by a factor of more than 2. In 1782, John Goodricke
(the discoverer of  Cephei’s variability) first suggested that these
brightness variations take place because Algol is an eclipsing binary. (We discussed this type of binary in Section 17-11.) The orbital plane of the two stars that make up the binary system
happens to be nearly edge-on to our line of sight, so one star periodically eclipses the other. Algol’s light curve (Figure 19-21a)
and spectrum show that Goodricke’s brilliant hypothesis is correct, and that Algol is a semidetached binary. The detached star
(on the right in Figure 19-21a) is a luminous blue main-sequence
star, while its less massive companion is a dimmer red giant that
fills its Roche lobe.

CAUTION! According to stellar evolution theory, the more
massive a star, the more rapidly it should evolve. Since the two
stars in a binary system form simultaneously and thus are the
same age, the more massive star should become a red giant before the less massive one. But in Algol and similar binaries, the
more massive star (on the right in Figure 19-21a) is still on the
main sequence, whereas the less massive star (on the left in
Figure 19-21a) has evolved to become a red giant. How can we
explain this apparent contradiction? The answer is that the red

detached binary, (b) a semidetached binary, (c) a contact binary, or
(d) an overcontact binary.

giant in Algol-type binaries was originally the more massive star.
As it left the main sequence to become a red giant, this star expanded until it overflowed its Roche lobe and dumped gas onto
its originally less massive companion. Because of the resulting
mass transfer, that companion (which is still on the main sequence) became the more massive star.
Mass transfer is also important in another class of semidetached binaries, called (beta) Lyrae variables, after their prototype in the constellation Lyra. As with Algol, the less massive
star in Lyrae (on the left in Figure 19-21b) fills its Roche lobe.
Unlike Algol, however, the more massive detached star (on the
right in Figure 19-21b) is the dimmer of the two stars. Apparently, this detached star is enveloped in a rotating accretion disk
of gas captured from its bloated companion. This disk partially
blocks the light coming from the detached star, making it appear
dimmer.
What is the fate of an Algol or Lyrae system? If the detached star is massive enough, it will evolve rapidly, expanding to
also fill its Roche lobe. The result will be an overcontact binary
in which the two stars share the gases of their outer layers. Such
binaries are sometimes called W Ursae Majoris stars, after the
prototype of this class (Figure 19-21c).

Three Eclipsing Binaries Compare the light curves of these
three eclipsing binaries to those in Figure 17-24. (a) Algol is a
semidetached binary. The deep eclipse occurs when the large red-giant
star blocks the light from the smaller but more luminous main-sequence
star. (Compare Figure 17-24b.) (b) Lyrae’s light curve is also at its
lowest when the larger star completely eclipses the smaller one. Half an

orbital period later, the smaller star partially eclipses the larger one,
making a shallower dip in the light curve. (c) W Ursae Majoris is an
overcontact binary in which both stars overfill their Roche lobes. The
extremely short period of this binary indicates that the two stars are very
close to each other.

Mass transfer can also continue even after nuclear reactions
cease in one of the stars in a close binary. In Chapters 20 and 21
we will see how mass transfer onto different types of dead stars
called white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes can produce
some of the most unusual and dramatic objects in the sky.

The Main-Sequence Lifetime: The duration of a star’s mainsequence lifetime depends on the amount of hydrogen available
to be consumed in the star’s core and the rate at which this hydrogen is consumed.
• The more massive a star, the shorter is its main-sequence lifetime. The Sun has been a main-sequence star for about 4.56 billion years and should remain one for about another 7 billion
years.
• During a star’s main-sequence lifetime, the star expands somewhat and undergoes a modest increase in luminosity.
• If a star’s mass is greater than about 0.4 M䉺, only the hydrogen present in the core can undergo thermonuclear fusion during
the star’s main-sequence lifetime. If the star is a red dwarf with a
mass less than about 0.4 M䉺, over time convection brings all of
the star’s hydrogen to the core where it can undergo fusion.
Becoming a Red Giant: Core hydrogen fusion ceases when the hydrogen has been exhausted in the core of a main-sequence star
with mass greater than about 0.4 M䉺. This leaves a core of nearly
pure helium surrounded by a shell through which hydrogen fusion works its way outward in the star. The core shrinks and becomes hotter, while the star’s outer layers expand and cool. The
result is a red giant star.
• As a star becomes a red giant, its evolutionary track moves rapidly from the main sequence to the red-giant region of the H-R
diagram. The more massive the star, the more rapidly this evolution takes place.

Population I stars were manufactured by thermonuclear reactions
in an earlier generation of Population II stars, then ejected into
space and incorporated into a later stellar generation.
Pulsating Variable Stars: When a star’s evolutionary track carries
it through a region in the H-R diagram called the instability strip,
the star becomes unstable and begins to pulsate.
• Cepheid variables are high-mass pulsating variables. There is a
direct relationship between their periods of pulsation and their
luminosities.
• RR Lyrae variables are low-mass, metal-poor pulsating variables with short periods.
• Long-period variable stars also pulsate but in a fashion that is
less well understood.
Close Binary Systems: Mass transfer in a close binary system occurs when one star in a close binary overflows its Roche lobe. Gas
flowing from one star to the other passes across the inner Lagrangian point. This mass transfer can affect the evolutionary history of the stars that make up the binary system.

Helium Fusion: When the central temperature of a red giant
reaches about 100 million K, helium fusion begins in the core.
This process, also called the triple alpha process, converts helium
to carbon and oxygen.

• In a more massive red giant, helium fusion begins gradually; in
a less massive red giant, it begins suddenly, in a process called the
helium flash.

chapter.
Problem-solving tips and tools
Recall from Section 16-1 that 6  1011 kg of hydrogen is
converted into helium each second at the Sun’s center. Recall
also that you must use absolute (Kelvin) temperatures when
using the Stefan-Boltzmann law. You may find it helpful to
review the discussion of apparent magnitude, absolute magnitude, and luminosity in Box 17-3. Section 17-4 discusses
the connection between the surface temperatures and colors
of stars. Newton’s form of Kepler’s third law (see Section
17-9) describes the orbits of stars in binary systems. Box 7-2
gives the formula for escape speed and for the average speeds
of gas molecules.

28. The radius of the Sun has increased over the past several billion years. Over the same time period, the size of the Moon’s
orbit around the Earth has also increased. A few billion years
ago, were annular eclipses of the Sun (see Figure 3-12) more
or less common than they are today? Explain.
29. The Sun has increased in radius by 6% over the past 4.56 billion years. Its present-day radius is 696,000 km. What was
its radius 4.56 billion years ago? (Hint: The answer is not
654,000 km.)
*30. Calculate the escape speed from (a) the surface of the presentday Sun and (b) the surface of the Sun when it becomes a red
giant, with essentially the same mass as today but with a radius that is 100 times larger. (c) Explain how your results
show that a red-giant star can lose mass more easily than a
main-sequence star.
*31. Calculate the average speed of a hydrogen atom (mass
1.67  1027 kg) (a) in the atmosphere of the present-day
Sun, with temperature 5800 K, and (b) in the atmosphere of
a 1-M䉺 red giant, with temperature 3500 K. (c) Compare
your results with the escape speeds that you calculated in
Question 27. Use this comparison to discuss how well the
present-day Sun and a 1-M䉺 red giant can retain hydrogen
in their atmospheres.
32. Use the value of the Sun’s luminosity (3.90  1026 watts, or
3.90  1026 joules per second) to calculate what mass of hydrogen the Sun will convert into helium during its entire
main-sequence lifetime of 1.2  1010 years. (Assume that the
Sun’s luminosity remains nearly constant during the entire
1.2  1010 years.) What fraction does this represent of the total mass of hydrogen that was originally in the Sun?
33. (a) The main-sequence stars Sirius (spectral type A1), Vega
(A0), Spica (B1), Fomalhaut (A3), and Regulus (B7) are
among the 20 brightest stars in the sky. Explain how you can
tell that all these stars are younger than the Sun. (b) The
third-brightest star in the sky, although it can be seen only
south of 29° north latitude, is (alpha) Centauri A. It is a
main-sequence star of spectral type G2, the same as the Sun.
Can you tell from this whether Centauri A is younger than
the Sun, the same age, or older? Explain your reasoning.
34. Using the same horizontal and vertical scales as in Figure
19-9a, make points on an H-R diagram for each of the stars
listed in Table 19-1. Label each point with the star’s mass
and its main-sequence lifetime. Which of these stars will remain on the main sequence after 109 years? After 1011 years?
*35. Explain why the quantity f in Box 19-2 has a different value
for stars with masses less than 0.4 M䉺 than for stars with
masses greater than 0.4 M䉺. In which case does f have a
greater value?
*36. Calculate the main-sequence lifetimes of (a) a 9-M䉺 star and
(b) a 0.25-M䉺 star. Compare these lifetimes with that of
the Sun.
*37. The earliest fossil records indicate that life appeared on the
Earth about a billion years after the formation of the solar
system. What is the most mass that a star could have in order that its lifetime on the main sequence is long enough to
permit life to form on one or more of its planets? Assume
that the evolutionary processes would be similar to those that
occurred on the Earth.

38. As a red giant, the Sun’s luminosity will be about 2000 times
greater than it is now, so the amount of solar energy falling
on the Earth will increase to 2000 times its present-day value.
Hence, to maintain thermal equilibrium, each square meter
of the Earth’s surface will have to radiate 2000 times as much
energy into space as it does now. Use the Stefan-Boltzmann
law to determine what the Earth’s surface temperature will
be under these conditions. (Hint: The present-day Earth has
an average surface temperature of 14°C.)
39. When the Sun becomes a red giant, its luminosity will be
about 2000 times greater than it is today. Assuming that this
luminosity is caused only by fusion of the Sun’s remaining
hydrogen, calculate how long our star will be a red giant. (In
fact, only a fraction of the remaining hydrogen will be consumed, and the luminosity will vary over time as shown in
Figure 19-8.)
40. What observations would you make of a star to determine
whether its primary source of energy is hydrogen fusion or
helium fusion?
41. The star whose spectrum is shown in Figure 19-15a has a
lower percentage of heavy elements than the Sun, whose spectrum is shown in Figure 19-15b. Hence, the star in Figure
19-15a has a higher percentage of hydrogen. Why, then,
isn’t the H absorption line of hydrogen noticeably darker for
the star in Figure 19-15a?
42. Would you expect the color of a Cepheid variable star (see
Figure 19-18) to change during the star’s oscillation period?
If not, why not? If so, describe why the color should change,
and describe the color changes you would expect to see during an oscillation period.
43. The brightness of a certain Cepheid variable star increases
and decreases with a period of 10 days. (a) What must this
star’s luminosity be if its spectrum has strong absorption lines
of hydrogen and helium, but no strong absorption lines of
heavy elements? (b) Repeat part (a) for the case in which
the star’s spectrum also has strong absorption lines of heavy
elements.
44. The star X Arietis is an RR Lyrae variable. Its apparent
brightness varies between 2.0  1015 and 4.9  1015 that
of the Sun with a period of 0.65 day. Interstellar extinction
dims the star by 37%. Approximately how far away is the
star?
45. The apparent brightness of  Cephei (a Type I Cepheid variable) varies with a period of 5.4 days. Its average apparent
brightness is 5.1  1013 that of the Sun. Approximately
how far away is  Cephei? (Ignore interstellar extinction.)
46. Suppose you find a binary star system in which the more
massive star is a red giant and the less massive star is a mainsequence star. Would you expect that mass transfer between
the stars has played an important role in the evolution of
these stars? Explain your reasoning.
47. The larger star in the Algol binary system (see Figure 19-21a)
is of spectral class K, while the smaller star is of spectral class
B. Discuss how the color of Algol changes as seen through a

Collaborative Exercises
63. The inverse relationship between a star’s mass and its mainsequence lifetime is sometimes likened to automobiles in that
the more massive vehicles, such as commercial semi–tractortrailer trucks, need to consume significantly more fuel to
travel at highway speeds than more lightweight and economical vehicles. As a group, create a table called “Maximum
Vehicle Driving Distances,” much like Table 19-1, “MainSequence Lifetimes,” by making estimates for any five vehicles of your groups’ choosing. The table’s column headings
should be: (1) vehicle make and model; (2) estimated gas tank
size; (3) cost to fill tank; (4) estimated mileage (in miles per
gallon); and (5) number of miles driven on a single fill-up.

how much longer a pulsation period would a Type II Cepheid
need in order to reach the same luminosity as the Type I
Cepheid in this time frame?

hen a star of 0.4 solar mass or more reaches the end of
its main-sequence lifetime and becomes a red giant, it
comes to have a compressed core and a bloated atmosphere. Finally, it devours its remaining nuclear fuels and begins
to die. The character of its death depends crucially on the value
of the star’s mass.
A star of relatively low mass—such as our own Sun—ends its
evolution by gently expelling its outer layers into space. These
ejected gases form a glowing cloud called a planetary nebula such
as the one shown here in the left-hand image. The burned-out
core that remains is called a white dwarf.
In contrast, a high-mass star ends its life in almost inconceivable violence. At the end of its short life, the core of such a star
collapses suddenly. This triggers a powerful supernova explosion
that can be as luminous as an entire galaxy of stars. A white
dwarf, too, can become a supernova if it accretes gas from a companion star in a close binary system.
Thermonuclear reactions in supernovae produce a wide variety of heavy elements, which are ejected into the interstellar
medium. (The supernova remnant shown here in the right-hand
image is rich in these elements.) Such heavy elements are essential

building blocks for terrestrial worlds like our Earth. Thus, the
deaths of massive stars can provide the seeds for planets orbiting
succeeding generations of stars.

20-1 Stars of between 0.4 and 4 solar masses
go through two distinct red-giant stages
All main-sequence stars convert hydrogen to helium in their cores
in a series of energy-releasing thermonuclear reactions. As we saw
in Section 19-1, convection within a low-mass main-sequence
star—a so-called red dwarf with a mass between 0.08 and
0.4 M䉺—will eventually bring all of the star’s hydrogen into the
core. Over hundreds of billions of years a red dwarf evolves into
an inert ball of helium. Convection is less important in mainsequence stars with masses greater than 0.4 M䉺, so these stars are

The Post–Main-Sequence Evolution of a 1-M䉺 Star

These H-R diagrams show the evolutionary track of a star
like the Sun as it goes through the stages of being (a) a red-giant star,

in Chapter 19 about the first stages of post–main-sequence
evolution for such a star. (Later in this chapter we’ll study the
evolution of more massive stars.)

The Red-Giant and Horizontal-Branch Stages: A Review
We can describe a star’s post–main-sequence evolution using an
evolutionary track on a H-R diagram. Figure 20-1 shows the
track for a 1-M䉺 star like the Sun. Once core hydrogen fusion
ceases, the core shrinks, heating the surrounding hydrogen and
triggering shell hydrogen fusion. The new outpouring of energy
causes the star’s outer layers to expand and cool, and the star becomes a red giant. As the luminosity increases and the surface
temperature drops, the post–main-sequence star moves up and to
the right along the red-giant branch on an H-R diagram (Figure
20-1a).
Next, the helium-rich core of the star shrinks and heats until
eventually core helium fusion begins. This second post–mainsequence stage begins gradually in stars more massive than about
2–3 M䉺, but for less massive stars it comes suddenly—in a helium flash. During core helium fusion, the surrounding hydrogenfusing shell still provides most of the red giant’s luminosity.
As we learned in Section 19-3, the core expands when core
helium fusion begins, which makes the core cool down a bit. (We
saw in Box 19-1 that letting a gas expand tends to lower its temperature, while compressing a gas tends to increase its temperature.) The cooling of the core also cools the surrounding
hydrogen-fusing shell, so that the shell releases energy more

star. The star eventually evolves into a planetary nebula (described in
Section 20-3).

slowly. Hence, the luminosity goes down a bit after core helium
fusion begins.
The slower rate of energy release also lets the star’s outer layers contract. As they contract, they heat up, so the star’s surface
temperature increases and its evolutionary track moves to the left
on the H-R diagram in Figure 20-1b. The luminosity changes relatively little during this stage, so the evolutionary track moves almost horizontally, along a path called the horizontal branch.
Horizontal-branch stars have helium-fusing cores surrounded by
hydrogen-fusing shells. Figure 19-12 shows horizontal-branch
stars in a globular cluster, and Figure 19-8 shows the evolution
of the luminosity of a 1-M䉺 star up to this point in its history.

AGB Stars: The Second Red-Giant Stage
Helium fusion produces nuclei of carbon and oxygen. After about
a hundred million (108) years of core helium fusion, essentially all
the helium in the core of a 1-M䉺 star has been converted into carbon and oxygen, the fusion of helium in the core ceases. (This
corresponds to the right-hand end of

a new stage of helium fusion begins in a thin shell around the
core. This process is called shell helium fusion.
History now repeats itself—the star enters a second red-giant
phase. A star first becomes a red giant at the end of its mainsequence lifetime, when the outpouring of energy from shell hydrogen fusion makes the star’s outer layers expand and cool. In
the same way, the outpouring of energy from shell helium fusion
causes the outer layers to expand again. The low-mass star ascends into the red-giant region of the H-R diagram for a second
time (Figure 20-1c), but now with even greater luminosity than
during its first red-giant phase.
Stars in this second red-giant phase are commonly called asymptotic giant branch stars, or AGB stars, and their evolutionary
tracks follow what is called the asymptotic giant branch. (Asymptotic means “approaching”; the name means that a star on the asymptotic giant branch approaches the red-giant branch from the
left on an H-R diagram.)
When a low-mass star first becomes an AGB star, it consists
of an inert, degenerate carbon-oxygen core and a helium-fusing
shell, both inside a hydrogen-fusing shell, all within a volume not
much larger than the Earth. This small, dense central region is
surrounded by an enormous hydrogen-rich envelope about as big
as Earth’s orbit around the Sun. After a while, the expansion of
the star’s outer layers causes the hydrogen-fusing shell to also expand and cool, and thermonuclear reactions in this shell temporarily cease. This leaves the aging star’s structure as shown in
Figure 20-2.
We saw in Section 19-1 that the more massive a star, the
shorter the amount of time it remains on the main sequence. Similarly, the greater the star’s mass, the more rapidly it goes through
the stages of post–main-sequence evolution. Hence, we can see all
of these stages by studying star clusters, which contain stars that
are all the same age but that have a range of masses (see Section
19-4). Figure 20-3 shows a color-magnitude diagram for the globular cluster M55, which is at least 13 billion years old. The least
massive stars in this cluster are still on the main sequence. Progressively more massive stars have evolved to the red giant branch,
the horizontal branch, and the asymptotic giant branch.

Figure 20-3

Stellar Evolution in a Globular Cluster In the old globular
cluster M55, stars with masses less than about 0.8 M䉺 are
still on the main sequence, converting hydrogen into helium in their cores.
Slightly more massive stars have consumed their core hydrogen and are
ascending the red-giant branch; even more massive stars have begun
helium core fusion and are found on the horizontal branch. The most
massive stars (which still have less than 4 M䉺) have consumed all the
helium in their cores and are ascending the asymptotic giant branch.

Chapter 20

A 1-M䉺 AGB star can reach a maximum luminosity of nearly
104 L䉺, as compared with approximately 103 L䉺 when it reached
the helium flash and a relatively paltry 1 L䉺 during its mainsequence lifetime. When the Sun becomes an AGB star some
12.3 billion years from now, this tremendous increase in luminosity will cause Mars and the Jovian planets to largely evaporate
away. The Sun’s bloated outer layers will reach to the Earth’s orbit. Mercury and perhaps Venus will simply be swallowed whole.

In the Sun, convection dominates only the outer layers, from around 0.71 solar radius (measured from the
center of the Sun) up to the photosphere (recall Figure
16-4). During the final stages of a star’s life, however, the convective zone can become so broad that it extends down to the
star’s core. At these times, convection can “dredge up” the heavy
elements produced in and around the core by thermonuclear fusion, transporting them all the way to the star’s surface.
DEEPE
NG

LOOKI

0.1
R2

The first dredge-up takes place after core hydrogen fusion stops, when the star becomes a red giant for the
first time. Convection dips so deeply into the star that
material processed by the CNO cycle of hydrogen fusion (see
Section 16-1) is carried up to the star’s surface, changing the relative abundances of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. A second
dredge-up occurs after core helium fusion ceases, further altering
the abundances of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. Still later, during the AGB stage, a third dredge-up can occur if the star has a
mass greater than about 2 M䉺. This third dredge-up transports
large amounts of freshly synthesized carbon to the star’s surface,
and the star’s spectrum thus exhibits prominent absorption bands
of carbon-rich molecules like C2, CH, and CN. For this reason,
an AGB star that has undergone a third dredge-up is called a
carbon star.
All AGB stars have very strong stellar winds that cause them
to lose mass at very high rates, up to 10⫺4 M䉺 per year (a thousand times greater than that of a red
giant, and 1010 times greater than
the rate at which our present-day The carbon that forms
Sun loses mass). The surface temper- the basis of all life on

As we saw in Section 16-2, energy is transported outward from a
star’s core by one of two processes—radiative diffusion or convection. The first is the passage of energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation, and it dominates only when a star’s gases are
relatively transparent. The second involves up-and-down movement of the star’s gases. Convection plays a very important role
in giant stars, because it helps supply the cosmos with the elements essential to life.

A Carbon Star TT Cygni is an AGB star in the constellation
Cygnus that ejects some of its carbon-rich outer layers into
space. Some of the ejected carbon combines with oxygen to form
molecules of carbon monoxide (CO), whose emissions can be detected
with a radio telescope. This radio image shows the CO emissions from a
shell of material that TT Cygni ejected some 7000 years ago. Over that
time, the shell has expanded to a diameter of about 1⁄2 light-year.

carbon stars are commonly found to be obscured in sooty cocoons of ejected matter (Figure 20-4).
Carbon stars are important because they enrich the interstellar medium with carbon and some nitrogen and oxygen. The
triple alpha process that occurs in helium fusion is the only way
that carbon can be made, and carbon stars are the primary avenue by which this element is dispersed into interstellar space. Indeed, most of the carbon in your body was produced long ago
inside a star by the triple alpha process (see Section 19-3). This
carbon was later dredged up to the star’s surface and ejected into
space. Some 4.56 billion years ago a clump of the interstellar
medium which contained this carbon coalesced into the solar nebula from which our Earth—and all of the life on it—eventually
formed. In this sense you can think of your body as containing
“recycled” material—substances that were once in the heart of a
star that formed and evolved long before our solar system existed.

20-3 Stars of moderately low mass die by
gently ejecting their outer layers, creating
planetary nebulae
For a star that began with a moderately low mass (between about
0.4 and 4 M䉺), the AGB stage in its evolution is a dramatic turning point. Before this stage, a star loses mass only gradually
through steady stellar winds. But as it evolves during its AGB

Stellar Evolution: The Deaths of Stars

Making a Planetary Nebula
To understand how an AGB star can eject its outer layers in
shells, consider the internal structure of such a star as shown in
Figure 20-2. As the helium in the helium-fusing shell is used up,
the pressure that holds up the dormant hydrogen-fusing shell decreases. Hence, the dormant hydrogen shell contracts and heats
up, and hydrogen fusion begins anew. This revitalized hydrogen
fusion creates helium, which rains downward onto the temporarily dormant helium-fusing shell. As the helium shell gains mass, it
shrinks and heats up. When the temperature of the helium shell
reaches a certain critical value, it reignites in a helium shell flash
that is similar to (but less intense than) the helium flash that occurred earlier in the evolution of a low-mass star (see Section
19-3). The released energy pushes the hydrogen-fusing shell outward, making it cool off, so that hydrogen fusion ceases and this
shell again becomes dormant. The process then starts over again.
When a helium shell flash occurs, the luminosity of an AGB
star increases substantially in a relatively short-lived burst called
a thermal pulse. Figure 20-5, which is based on a theoretical calculation of the evolution of a 1-M䉺 star, shows that thermal
pulses begin when the star is about 12.365 billion years old. The
calculations predict that thermal pulses occur at ever-shorter intervals of about 100,000 years.
During these thermal pulses, the dying star’s outer layers can
separate completely from its carbon-oxygen core. As the ejected
material expands into space, dust grains condense out of the cooling gases. Radiation pressure from the star’s hot, burned-out core
acts on the specks of dust, propelling them further outward, and
the star sheds its outer layers altogether. In this way an aging
1-M䉺 star loses as much as 40% of its mass. More massive stars
eject even greater fractions of their original mass.
As a dying star ejects its outer layers, the star’s hot core becomes exposed. With a surface temperature of about 100,000 K,
this exposed core emits ultraviolet radiation intense enough to
ionize and excite the expanding shell of ejected gases. These gases
therefore glow and emit visible light through the process of fluorescence (see Box 18-1), producing a planetary nebula like those
shown in Figure 20-6.

CAUTION! Despite their name, planetary nebulae have nothing
to do with planets. This misleading term was introduced in the
nineteenth century because these glowing objects looked like
distant Jovian planets when viewed through the small telescopes

of a star is called a planetary nebula. The left-hand image on the

then available. The difference between planets and planetary
nebulae became obvious with the advent of spectroscopy: Planets have absorption line spectra (see Section 7-3), but the excited
gases of planetary nebulae have emission line spectra.

The Properties of Planetary Nebulae
Planetary nebulae are quite common. Astronomers estimate that
there are 20,000 to 50,000 planetary nebulae in our Galaxy alone.
Many planetary nebulae, such as those in Figure 20-6, are more
or less spherical in shape. This is a result of the symmetrical way
in which the gases were ejected. But if the rate of expansion is not
the same in all directions, the resulting nebula takes on an hourglass or dumbbell appearance (Figure 20-7).
Spectroscopic observations of planetary nebulae show emission lines of ionized hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen. From the
Doppler shifts of these lines, astronomers have concluded that the
expanding shell of gas moves outward from a dying star at speeds
from 10 to 30 km/s. For a shell expanding at such speeds to have
attained the typical diameter of a planetary nebula, about 1 lightyear, it must have begun expanding about 10,000 years ago.
Thus, by astronomical standards, the planetary nebulae we see today were created only very recently.
We do not observe planetary nebulae that are more than
about 50,000 years old. After this length of time, the shell has
spread out so far from the cooling central star that its gases cease
to glow and simply fade from view. The nebula’s gases then mix
with the surrounding interstellar medium.

Stellar Evolution: The Deaths of Stars

20-4 The burned-out core of a moderately
low-mass star cools and contracts until it
becomes a white dwarf
We have seen that after a moderately low-mass star (from about
0.4 to about 4 solar masses) consumes all the hydrogen in its core,
it is able to ignite thermonuclear reactions that convert helium to
carbon and oxygen. Given sufficiently high temperature and pressure, carbon and oxygen can also undergo fusion reactions that
release energy. But for such a moderately low-mass star, the core
temperature and pressure never reach the extremely high values
needed for these reactions to take place. Instead, as we have seen,
the process of mass ejection just strips away the star’s outer layers and leaves behind the hot carbon-oxygen core. With no thermonuclear reactions taking place, the core simply cools down like
a dying ember. Such a burnt-out relic of a star’s former glory is
called a white dwarf. Such white dwarfs prove to have exotic physical properties that are wholly unlike any object found on Earth.

CAUTION! Unfortunately, the word dwarf is used in astron-

est star in the night sky. In 1844 the German astronomer Friedrich
Bessel noticed that Sirius was moving back and forth slightly, as
if it was being orbited by an unseen object. This companion, designated Sirius B (Figure 20-8), was first glimpsed in 1862 by the
American astronomer Alvan Clark. Recent Hubble Space Telescope observations at ultraviolet wavelengths, where hot white
dwarfs emit most of their light, show that the surface temperature of Sirius B is 25,200 K. (By contrast, the main-sequence star
Sirius A has a surface temperature of 10,500 K, while the Sun’s
surface temperature is a relatively frosty 5800 K.)
Observations of white dwarfs in binary systems like Sirius allow astronomers to determine the mass, radius, and density of
these stars (see Sections 17-9, 17-10, and 17-11). Such observations show that the density of the degenerate matter in a white
dwarf is typically 109 kg/m3 (a million times denser than water).
A teaspoonful of white dwarf matter brought to Earth would
weigh nearly 5.5 tons—as much as an elephant!

The Mass-Radius Relation for White Dwarfs
As we learned in Section 17-3, degenerate matter has a very different relationship between its pressure, density, and temperature

omy for several very different kinds of small objects. Here’s a
review of the three kinds that we have encountered so far in this
book. A white dwarf is the relic that remains at the very end of
the evolution of a star of initial mass between about 0.4 M䉺 and
4 M䉺. Thermonuclear reactions are no longer taking place in its
interior; it emits light simply because it is still hot. A red dwarf,
discussed in Section 19-1, is a cool main-sequence star with a
mass between about 0.08 M䉺 and 0.4 M䉺. The energy emitted
by a red dwarf in the form of light comes from its core, where
fusion reactions convert hydrogen into helium. Finally, a brown
dwarf (see Section 8-6 and Section 17-5) is an object like a
main-sequence star but with a mass less than about 0.08 M䉺.
Because its mass is so small, its internal pressure and temperature are too low to sustain thermonuclear reactions. Instead, a
brown dwarf emits light because it is slowly contracting, a
process that releases energy (see Section 16-1). White dwarfs are
comparable in size to the Earth (see Section 17-7); by contrast,
brown dwarfs are larger than the planet Jupiter, and red dwarfs
are even larger.

Properties of White Dwarfs
You might think that without thermonuclear reactions to provide
internal heat and pressure, a white dwarf should keep on shrinking under the influence of its own gravity as it cools. Actually,
however, a cooling white dwarf
maintains its size, because the burnt- A white dwarf is kept

Section 17-3). Thus, degenerate- pressure of its
electron pressure supports the star degenerate electrons
against further collapse. This pressure does not depend on temperature, so it continues to hold up
the star even as the white dwarf cools and its temperature drops.
Many white dwarfs are found in the solar neighborhood, but
all are too faint to be seen with the naked eye. One of the first
white dwarfs to be discovered is a companion to Sirius, the bright-

Figure 20-9 displays the mass-radius relation for white
dwarfs. Note that the more degenerate matter you pile
onto a white dwarf, the smaller it becomes. However,
there is a limit to how much pressure degenerate electrons can
produce. As a result, there is an upper limit to the mass that a
white dwarf can have. This maximum mass is called the Chandrasekhar limit, after the Indian-American scientist Subrahmanyan
Chandrasekhar, who pioneered theoretical studies of white dwarfs
in the 1930s. (The orbiting Chandra X-ray Observatory, described
in Section 6-7, is named in his honor.) The Chandrasekhar limit
is equal to 1.4 M䉺, meaning that all white dwarfs must have
masses less than 1.4 M䉺.
The material inside a white dwarf consists mostly of ionized
carbon and oxygen atoms floating in a sea of degenerate electrons. As the dead star cools, the carbon and oxygen ions slow
down, and electric forces between the ions begin to prevail over
the random thermal motions. About 5 ⫻ 109 years after the star
first becomes a white dwarf, when its luminosity has dropped to
about 10⫺4 L䉺 and its surface temperature is a mere 4000 K, the
ions no longer move freely. Instead, they arrange themselves in
orderly rows, like an immense crystal lattice. From this time on,
you could say that the star is “solid.” The degenerate electrons

White Dwarf “Cooling Curves” As white dwarf stars radiate their
internal energy into space, they become dimmer and cooler. The blue

The more massive a white dwarf, the smaller and hence fainter it is.
Compare these “cooling curves” with the lines of constant radius in
Figure 17-15b.

Track B and Track C in Figure 20-10). Finally, as the ejected nebulae fade and the stellar cores cool, the evolutionary tracks of
these dying stars take a sharp turn toward the white dwarf region
of the H-R diagram. As the table accompanying Figure 20-10
shows, the final white dwarf has only a fraction of the mass of
the giant star from which it evolved.
Although a white dwarf maintains the same size as it cools,
its luminosity and surface temperature both decrease with time.
Consequently, the evolutionary tracks of aging white dwarfs point
toward the lower right corner of the H-R diagram. You can see
this in Figure 20-10; Figure 20-11 shows it in more detail. The
energy that the white dwarf radiates into space comes only from
the star’s internal heat, which is a relic from the white dwarf’s
past existence as a stellar core. Over billions of years, white
dwarfs grow dimmer and dimmer as their surface temperatures
drop toward absolute zero.
After ejecting much of its mass into space, our own Sun will
eventually evolve into a white dwarf star about the size of the
Earth and with perhaps one-tenth of its present luminosity. It will
become even dimmer as it cools. After 5 billion years as a white
dwarf, the Sun will radiate with no more than one ten-thousandth
of its present brilliance. With the passage of eons, our Sun will
simply fade into obscurity. The Cosmic Connections figure summarizes the full evolutionary cycle of a 1-M䉺 star like the Sun,
from its birth as a main-sequence star to its demise as a white
dwarf.

During the entire lifetime of a low-mass red dwarf star (with an
initial mass less than about 0.4 M䉺), the only thermonuclear reaction that takes place is the fusion of hydrogen nuclei to form
helium nuclei. In stars with initial masses from about 0.4 M䉺 to
about 4 M䉺, a second kind of thermonuclear reaction takes
place—helium fusion. The heaviest elements manufactured by helium fusion are carbon and oxygen.
The life story of a high-mass star (with an initial, zero-age
mass greater than about 4 M䉺) begins with these same reactions.
But theoretical calculations show that high-mass stars can also go
through several additional stages of thermonuclear reactions involving the fusion of carbon, oxygen, and other heavy nuclei. As
a result, high-mass stars end their lives quite differently from lowmass stars.

Heavy-Element Fusion in Massive Stars
Why is fusion of heavy nuclei possible only in a high-mass star?
The reason is that heavy nuclei have large electric charges: For example, a nucleus of carbon has 6 positively charged protons and
hence 6 times the charge of a hydrogen nucleus (which has a single proton). This means that there are strong electric forces that
tend to keep these nuclei apart. Only at the great speeds associated
with extremely high temperatures can the nuclei travel fast enough
to overcome their mutual electric repulsion and fuse together. To
produce these very high temperatures at a star’s center, the pressure must also be very high. Hence, the star must have a very large
mass, because only such a star has strong enough gravity trying to
pull it together and thus strong enough pressure at its center.
As we discussed in Section 19-2, when a main-sequence star
with a mass greater than about 0.4 M䉺 uses up its core hydrogen, it begins shell hydrogen fusion and enters a red-giant phase.
Such a star then begins core helium fusion when the core temperature becomes high enough. The differences between moderately
low-mass (from about 0.4 M䉺 to about 4 M䉺) and high-mass
stars (more than about 4 M䉺) become pronounced after helium
core fusion ends, when the core is composed primarily of carbon
and oxygen.
Let us consider how the late stages in the evolution of a highmass star differ from those of a low-mass star. In low-mass stars,
as we saw in Section 20-4, the carbon-oxygen core eventually becomes exposed and becomes a white dwarf. But in stars whose
overall mass is more than about 4 M䉺, the carbon-oxygen core
is more massive than the Chandrasekhar limit of 1.4 M䉺, so
degenerate-electron pressure cannot prevent the core from contracting and heating. Hence, a high-mass star is able to enter a
new round of core thermonuclear reactions. When the central
temperature of such a high-mass star reaches 600 million kelvins
(6 ⫻ 108 K), the first of the new thermonuclear reactions, carbon
fusion, begins. Carbon fusion consumes carbon nuclei (12C, with
6 protons in each nucleus) and produces oxygen (16O, 8 protons),
neon (20Ne, 10 protons), sodium (23Na, 11 protons), and magnesium (23Mg and 24Mg, each with 12 protons).
If a star has an even larger main-sequence mass of about
8 M䉺 or so (before mass ejection), even more thermonuclear

The present-day Sun is a mainsequence star – in its core,
hydrogen fuses to produce helium.

At the end of the Sun’s mainsequence lifetime, fusion stops in
the core (which has been converted
to helium).

As the core contracts and heats, the
core helium begins to fuse to make
carbon and oxygen. The core
expands and the rate of energy
release slows.

the fusion reactions in the shell and
making the outer layers expand

Mass Loss from a Supergiant Star At the heart of this
nebulosity, called SMC N76, lies a supergiant star with a mass
of at least 18 M䉺. This star is losing mass at a rapid rate in a strong
stellar wind. As this wind collides with the surrounding interstellar gas
and dust, it creates the “bubble” shown here. SMC N76, which has an
angular diameter of 130 arcsec, lies within the Small Magellanic Cloud, a
small galaxy that orbits our Milky Way. It is about 60,600 pc (198,000 ly)
distant. (Y. Nazé, G. Rauw, J. Manfroid, and J.-M. Vreux, Liège Institute;
Y.-H. Chu, U. of Illinois; and ESO)

reactions can take place. After the cessation of carbon fusion, the
core will again contract, and the star’s central temperature can
rise to 1 billion kelvins (109 K). At this temperature neon fusion
begins. This uses up the neon accumulated from carbon fusion

535

and further increases the concentrations of oxygen and magnesium in the star’s core.
After neon fusion ends, the core will again contract, and oxygen fusion will begin when the central temperature of the star
reaches about 1.5 billion kelvins (1.5 ⫻ 109 K). The principal
product of oxygen fusion is silicon (28Si, 14 protons). Once oxygen fusion is over, the core will contract yet again. If the central
temperature reaches about 2.7 billion kelvins (2.7 ⫻ 109 K),
silicon fusion begins, producing a variety of nuclei from sulfur
(32S, 16 protons) to iron (56Fe, 26 protons) and nickel (56Ni,
28 protons). While all of this is going on in the star’s interior, at
the surface the star is losing mass at a rapid rate (Figure 20-12).
As a high-mass star consumes increasingly heavier nuclei, the
thermonuclear reactions produce a wider variety of products. For
example, oxygen fusion produces not only silicon but also magnesium (24Mg, with 12 protons), phosphorus (31P, with 15 protons), and sulfur (31S and 32S, each with 16 protons). Some
thermonuclear reactions that create heavy elements also release
neutrons. A neutron is like a proton except that it carries no electric charge. Therefore, neutrons are not repelled by positively
charged nuclei, and so can easily collide and combine with them.
This absorption of neutrons by nuclei, called neutron capture,
creates many elements and isotopes that are not produced directly
in fusion reactions.
Each stage of thermonuclear reactions in a high-mass star
helps to trigger the succeeding stage. In each stage, when the star
exhausts a given variety of nuclear fuel in its core, gravitational
contraction takes the core to ever-higher densities and temperatures, thereby igniting the “ash” of the previous fusion stage—
and possibly the outlying shell of unburned fuel as well.

Supergiant Stars and Their Evolution
The increasing density and temperature of the core make each
successive thermonuclear reaction more rapid than the one that
preceded it. As an example, Table 20-1 shows a theoretical calculation of the evolutionary stages for a star with a zero-age mass
of 25 M䉺. This calculation indicates that carbon fusion in such a
star lasts for 600 years, neon fusion for 1 year, and oxygen fusion for only 6 months. The last, and briefest, stage of nuclear reactions is silicon fusion. The entire core supply of silicon in a
25-M䉺 star is used up in only one day!

and the result is a star with an iron-rich core in which no thermonuclear reactions take place (see Figure 20-13).
Shell fusion in the layers surrounding the iron-rich core consumes the star’s remaining reserves of fuel. At this stage the entire energy-producing region of the star is contained in a volume
no bigger than the Earth, some 106 times smaller in radius than
the overall size of the star. This state of affairs will soon come to
an end, because the buildup of an inert, iron-rich core signals the
impending violent death of a massive supergiant star.

Jupiter’s orbit

Figure 20-13
The Structure of an Old High-Mass Star Near the end of its life, a star
with an initial mass greater than about 8 M䉺 becomes a red supergiant.
The star’s overall size can be as large as Jupiter’s orbit around the Sun.
The stars energy comes from a series of concentric fusing shells, all
combined within a volume roughly the same size as the Earth.
Thermonuclear reactions do not occur within the iron core, because
fusion reactions that involve iron absorb energy rather than release it.

Each stage of core fusion in a high-mass star generates a new
shell of material around the core. After several such stages, the internal structure of a truly massive
star—say, 25 to 30 M䉺 or greater— A star of 8 or more solar
resembles that of an onion (see
masses evolves into a
Figure 20-13). Because thermonuclear reactions can take place simul- supergiant 100 times
taneously in several shells, energy is (or more) larger than
released at such a rapid rate that the the Sun
star’s outer layers expand tremendously. The result is a supergiant star, whose luminosity and radius are much larger than those of a giant (see Section 17-7).
Several of the brightest stars in the sky are supergiants, including Betelgeuse and Rigel in the constellation Orion and
Antares in the constellation Scorpius. (Figure 17-15 shows the locations of these stars on an H-R diagram.) They appear bright not
because they are particularly close, but because they are extraordinarily luminous.
A supergiant star cannot keep adding shells to its “onion”
structure forever, because the sequence of thermonuclear reactions cannot go on indefinitely. In order for an element to serve
as a thermonuclear fuel, energy must be given off when its nuclei
collide and fuse. This released energy is a result of the strong nuclear force of attraction that draws nucleons (neutrons and protons) together. However, protons also repel one another by the
weaker electric force. As a result of this electric repulsion, adding
extra protons to nuclei larger than iron, which has 26 protons,
requires an input of energy rather than causing energy to be released. Nuclei of this size or larger cannot act as fuel for thermonuclear reactions. Hence, the sequence of fusion stages ends
with silicon fusion. One of the products of silicon fusion is iron,

Our present understanding is that all stars of about 8 M䉺 or less
divest most of their mass in the form of planetary nebulae. The
burned-out core that remains settles down to become a white
dwarf star. But the truly massive stars—stellar heavyweights that
begin their lives with more than 8 solar masses of material—do
not pass through a planetary nebula phase. Instead, they die in
spectacular core-collapse supernova explosions.

The Violent End of a High-Mass Star
To understand what happens in a core-collapse supernova explosion, we must look deep inside a massive star at the end of its life.
Of course, we cannot do this in actuality, because the interiors of
stars are opaque. But astronomers have developed theoretical
models based on what we know about the behavior of gases and
atomic nuclei. The story that follows, while largely theoretical,
describes our observations of supernovae fairly well. And, as we will
see in Section 20-8, a special kind of “telescope” has allowed us
to glimpse the interior of at least one relatively nearby supernova.
The core of an aging, massive star gets progressively hotter
as it contracts to ignite successive stages of thermonuclear fusion
(see Stage 1 in Figure 20-14). Wien’s law (Section 5-4) and Planck’s
law (Section 5-5) together tell us that as the temperature of an object like a star increases, so does the energy of the photons it
emits. When the temperature in the core of a massive star reaches
a few hundred million kelvins, the photons are energetic enough
to initiate a host of nuclear reactions that create neutrinos. These
neutrinos, which carry off energy, escape from the star’s core, just
as solar neutrinos flow freely out of the Sun (see Section 16-4).
To compensate for the energy drained by the neutrinos, the
star must provide energy either by
consuming more thermonuclear fuel,
By forming a dense core
by contracting, or both. But when
of iron, a massive star
the star’s core is converted into iron,
no more energy-producing ther- sows the seeds of its own
monuclear reactions are possible, destruction
and the only source of energy is contraction and rapid heating (see Stage 2 in Figure 20-14).
Once a star with an original mass of about 8 M䉺 or more
develops an iron-rich core, the core contracts very rapidly, so
that the core temperature skyrockets to 5 ⫻ 109 K within a
tenth of a second. The gamma-ray photons emitted by the intensely hot core have so much energy that when they collide
with iron nuclei, they begin to break the iron nuclei down
into much smaller helium nuclei (4He). This process is called

photodisintegration. As Table 20-1 shows, it takes a high-mass
star millions of years and several stages of thermonuclear reactions to build up an iron core; within a fraction of a second,
photodisintegration undoes the result of those millions of years
of reactions.
Within another tenth of a second, the core becomes so
dense that the negatively charged electrons within it are forced
to combine with the positively charged protons to produce electrically neutral neutrons. This process also releases a flood of
neutrinos, denoted by the Greek letter ␯ (nu):

of 4 ⫻ 1017 kg/m3. This is nuclear density, the density with
which neutrons and protons are packed together inside nuclei.
(If the Earth were compressed to this density, it would be only
300 meters, or 1000 feet, in diameter.)
Matter at nuclear density or higher is extraordinarily difficult
to compress. Thus, when the density of the neutron-rich core begins to exceed nuclear density, the core suddenly becomes very
stiff and rigid. The core’s contraction comes to a sudden halt, and
the innermost part of the core actually bounces back and expands
somewhat. This core bounce sends a powerful wave of pressure,
like an unimaginably intense sound wave, outward into the outer
core (see Stage 3 in Figure 20-14).
During this critical stage, the cooling of the core has caused
the pressure to decrease profoundly in the regions surrounding
the core. Without pressure to hold it up against gravity, the material from these regions plunges inward at speeds up to 15% of
the speed of light. When this inward-moving material crashes
down onto the rigid core, it encounters the outward-moving pressure wave. In just a fraction of a second, the material that fell
onto the core begins to move back out toward the star’s surface,

e⫺ ⫹ p 씮 n ⫹ ␯
Although neutrinos interact only very weakly with matter
(see Section 16-4), the core is now so dense that even neutrinos
cannot escape from it immediately. But because these neutrinos
carry away a substantial amount of energy as they escape from
the core, the core cools down and condenses even further.
At about 0.25 second after its rapid contraction begins, the
core is less than 20 km in diameter and its density is in excess

propelled in part by the flood of neutrinos trying to escape from
the star’s core.
Supercomputer simulations of this complex process show
that if the pressure wave were to spread outward at precisely the
same speed in all directions, its energy would be absorbed by
the gas around the core and the wave would fizzle out. But when
the simulations allow for the presence of convection and turbulence in the dying star’s gases, the result is quite different: The
material surrounding the core behaves more like water boiling furiously in a heated pot. Rising bubbles of superheated gases deliver extra energy to the pressure wave, sustaining it and making
it accelerate as it plows outward through the doomed star’s outer
layers. The wave soon reaches a speed greater than the speed of
sound waves in the star’s outer layers. When this happens, the
wave becomes a shock wave, like the sonic boom produced by a
supersonic airplane (see Stage 4 in Figure 20-14).
After a few hours, the shock wave reaches the star’s surface, by which time the star’s outer layers have begun to lift
away from the core. When the star’s outer layers thin out suf-

ficiently, a portion of this energy escapes in a torrent of light
(see Stage 5 in Figure 20-14). The star has become a supernova
(plural supernovae). Specifically, what we have described is the
formation of a core-collapse supernova. We use this term because, as we will see in Section 20-9, it is possible for supernova explosions to occur that do not involve the collapse of the
core of a massive star.

CAUTION! The energy released in a core-collapse supernova is

an incomprehensibly large 1046 joules—a hundred times more
energy than the Sun has emitted due to thermonuclear reactions
over its entire 4.56-billion year history. However, it is important
to recognize that the source of the supernova’s energy release is
not thermonuclear reactions. Rather, it is the gravitational energy released by the collapse of the core and by the inward fall
of the star’s outer layers. (You release gravitational energy when
you fall off a diving board, and this released energy goes into
making a big splash in the swimming pool.) The energy released
by the collapse of the core reappears in the form of neutrinos;

Stellar Evolution: The Deaths of Stars

the fall of the outer layers provides the energy to power the nuclear reactions that generate the supernova’s electromagnetic radiation. The amount of energy release from the supernova is so
great because the star is so massive; hence, the amount of material that falls inward is immense, it falls a great distance, and
is acted on by a strong gravitational pull as it falls.

The Wreckage of a Core-Collapse Supernova
Supercomputer simulations provide many insights into the violent, complex, and rapidly changing conditions deep inside a star
as it is torn apart by a supernova explosion (Figure 20-15). For
example, Figure 20-15a shows a snapshot of the interior of a
high-mass star 51⁄2 hours after the stiffening of the core. The simulation predicts turbulent swirls and eddies that grow behind the
shock wave as it moves outward from the star’s core. Evidence in
favor of such turbulence comes from images of the remnants of
long-ago supernovae (Figure 20-15b). Such images show that material is ejected from the supernova not in uniform shells but in
irregular clumps. This is just what would be expected from a turbulent explosion. (We discuss supernova remnants further in
Section 20-10.)
Detailed computer calculations suggest that a 25-M䉺 star
ejects about 96% of its material to the interstellar medium for use
in producing future generations of stars. Less massive stars eject
a smaller percentage of their mass into space when they become
core-collapse supernovae.
Before this material is ejected into space, it is compressed so
much by the passage of the shock wave through the star’s outer
layers that a new wave of thermonuclear reactions sets in. These
reactions can produce many more chemical elements, including elements heavier than iron. Reactions of this kind require a tremendous input of energy, and thus cannot take place during the star’s
pre-supernova lifetime.
The energy-rich environment of a supernova shock wave is
almost the only place in the universe where such heavy elements

as zinc, silver, tin, gold, mercury, lead, and uranium can be produced. (In Chapter 21 we will see another, even more exotic
mechanism for producing these heaviest elements.) Remarkably,
all of these elements are found on the Earth. Hence, some of the
material that makes up our solar system, our Earth, and our bodies must long ago have been part of a star that lived, evolved, and
died as a supernova.

20-7 In 1987 a nearby supernova gave us a
close-up look at the death of a massive star
Supernovae have peak luminosities as great as 109 L䉺, rivaling
the light output of an entire galaxy. This makes it possible to see
supernovae in galaxies far beyond our own Milky Way Galaxy,
and indeed hundreds of these distant supernovae are observed
each year (Figure 20-16). In a handful of cases, images made before the explosion have allowed astronomers to identify the star
that subsequently exploded into a supernova, called the progenitor star. For example, the progenitor star shown in Figure 20-16b
was a red supergiant star whose internal structure probably resembled that shown in cross section in Figure 20-13.
One frustrating aspect of these distant supernovae is simply
that they are distant, and so cannot be studied in as much detail
as astronomers would like. But one recent and unusually close supernova has provided astronomers with a unique opportunity to
check the theoretical ideas presented in Section 20-6.

A Supernova in the Galaxy Next Door
On February 23, 1987, a supernova was discovered in the Large
Magellanic Cloud (LMC), a companion galaxy to our Milky Way
some 51,500 pc (168,000 ly) from Earth. The supernova, designated SN 1987A because it was the first discovered that year, occurred near an enormous H II region in the LMC called the

Supernova 1987A was
The supernova was so bright that
observers in the southern hemisphere the first nearby
supernova to be seen
could see it without a telescope.
Such a bright supernova is a rare since the invention of
event. In the last thousand years, the telescope
only five other supernovae—in 1006,
1054, 1181, 1572, and 1604—have
been bright enough to be seen with the naked eye, and all of these
occurred in our own Milky Way Galaxy. (As we described in
Section 4-3, the supernova of 1572 had a major influence on
Tycho Brahe’s ideas about the heavens.) Although outside our
Galaxy, SN 1987A occurred relatively close to us in a part of the
heavens that is obscured only slightly by the Milky Way’s interstellar dust. Furthermore, not long after SN 1987A appeared, several new orbiting telescopes were placed into service. These
enabled astronomers to study the supernova’s evolution with unprecedented resolution and in wavelength ranges not accessible
from the Earth’s surface (see Section 6-7). As a result, SN 1987A
has given astronomers an unprecedented view of the violent death
of a massive star.
The light from a supernova such as SN 1987A does not all
come in a single brief flash; the outer layers continue to glow as
they expand into space. For the first 20 days after the detonation
of SN 1987A, its glow was powered primarily by the tremendous
heat that the shock wave deposited in the star’s outer layers. As
the expanding gases cooled, the light energy began to be provided
by a different source—the decay of radioactive isotopes of cobalt,
nickel, and titanium produced in the supernova explosion.
Astronomers have been able to pinpoint the specific isotopes
involved because different radioactive nuclei emit gamma rays of

different wavelengths when they decay. These emissions have
been detected by orbiting gamma-ray telescopes (see Figure 6-31).
Thanks to these radioactive decays, the brightness of SN 1987A
actually increased for the first 85 days after the detonation, then
settled into a slow decline as the radioactive isotopes were used
up. The supernova remained visible to the naked eye for several
months after the detonation.

Why SN 1987A Was Unusual
Ideally, SN 1987A would have confirmed the theories of astronomers about typical supernovae. But SN 1987A was not typical. Its luminosity peaked at roughly 108 L䉺, only a tenth of the
maximum luminosity observed for other, more distant supernovae. Fortunately, the doomed star had been observed prior to
becoming a supernova, and these observations helped explain
why SN 1987A was an exceptional case.
Figure 20-13 suggests that a massive star should be in a red
supergiant stage when the iron core collapses and the star becomes a supernova. As we have mentioned, this was indeed the
case for the progenitor star shown in Figure 20-16b, and is also
the case for other supernovae seen in distant galaxies. The progenitor star of SN 1987A was indeed a high-mass star: Its estimated main sequence mass was about 20 M䉺, although by the
time it exploded—some 107 years after it first formed—it probably had shed a few solar masses. However, this progenitor star
was identified not as a red supergiant, but as a blue B3 I supergiant (Figure 20-18).
The explanation of this seeming contradiction is that stars in
the Large Magellanic Cloud, including the progenitor of
SN 1987A, are Population II stars with a very low percentage of
metals—that is, elements heavier than hydrogen and helium (see
Section 19-5). A small difference in the amount of metals present
can affect whether a star’s interior is relatively transparent or
opaque, just as a small amount of dirt can make a window difficult to see through. As a result, a high-mass Population II star follows a somewhat different evolutionary track than does a
Population I star (with a greater percentage of metals) of the same
mass. On an H-R diagram, an aging high-mass star of Population
I goes directly from the main sequence to the red supergiant region at the upper right of the diagram. By contrast, the track for
an equally massive Population II star wanders from left to right
and back again across the top of the H-R diagram as the star alternates between being a hot, blue supergiant (on the left in an
H-R diagram) and a cool red supergiant (on the right in an H-R
diagram). Apparently the progenitor star of SN 1987A developed
an iron core and became a supernova when it was in the blue supergiant stage.
A massive Population II star like the SN 1987A progenitor
changes dramatically in size as it alternates between being a red
supergiant and a blue supergiant. When in a blue supergiant
phase, its radius may be less than 1/10 as large as when it is in a
red supergiant phase. Hence, the progenitor star was relatively
small when its core collapsed (though its radius was still more
than 10 times that of our Sun). This means that the star’s outer
layers were close to the core and thus held more strongly by the
core’s gravitational attraction. When the detonation occurred, a
relatively large fraction of the shock wave’s energy had to be used
against this gravitational attraction to push the outer layers into

small section of the Large Magellanic Cloud as it appeared

converted into light was smaller than for most supernovae. This
explains why SN 1987A was only a tenth as bright as an exploding red supergiant would have been.

The Aftermath of SN 1987A

of glowing gas around the exploded star. After the optics of the
Hubble Space Telescope were repaired in 1994 (see Section 6-7),
SN 1987A was observed again and a set of three glowing rings
was revealed (Figure 20-19a).
These rings are relics of a hydrogen-rich outer atmosphere
that was ejected by gentle stellar winds from the progenitor star
when it was a red supergiant, about 20,000 years ago. This

diffuse gas expanded in a hourglass shape (Figure 20-19b), because it was blocked from expanding around the star’s equator
either by a preexisting ring of gas or by the orbit of an as yet unseen companion star. (Figure 20-7 shows a similar model used to
explain the shapes of certain planetary nebulae.) The outer rings
in Figure 20-19a are parts of the hourglass that were ionized by
the initial flash of ultraviolet radiation from the supernova; as
electrons recombine with the ions, the rings emit visible-light photons. (We described this process of recombination in Section 18-2.)

By the early years of the twenty-first century,
the shock wave from the supernova was beginning to collide with the “waist” of the
hourglass shown in Figure 20-19b. This collision is making the
hourglass glow more brightly in visible wavelengths—though not
enough, unfortunately, to make the supernova again visible to the
naked eye—and emit copious radiation at X-ray and ultraviolet
wavelengths.
By studying this cosmic collision, astronomers hope to learn
more about the shock wave and the supernova explosion that
spawned it. They hope as well to learn about the matter in the inner ring, which will give us insight into the stellar winds that blew
from the progenitor star thousands of years ago. Because
SN 1987A provides a unique laboratory for studying the evolution of a supernova, astronomers will monitor it carefully for
decades to come.

20-8 Neutrinos emanate from
supernovae like SN 1987A
In addition to electromagnetic radiation, supernovae also emit a
brief but intense burst of neutrinos from their collapsing cores.
In fact, theory suggests that most of the energy released by the
exploding star is in the form of neutrinos. If it were possible to detect
the flood of neutrinos from an ex- Observations of SN
ploding star, astronomers would 1987A confirm that a

processes that occur within the star emits most of its energy
during its final seconds before bein the form of neutrinos
coming a supernova.
Unfortunately, detecting neutrinos is difficult because under
most conditions matter is transparent to neutrinos (see Section
16-4). Consequently, when supernova neutrinos encounter the
Earth, almost all of them pass completely through the planet as
if it were not there. The challenge to scientists is to detect the tiny
fraction of neutrinos that do interact with the matter through
which they pass.

Neutrino Telescopes
During the 1980s, two “neutrino telescopes” uniquely suited for
detecting supernova neutrinos went into operation—the
Kamiokande detector in Japan (a joint project of the University
of Tokyo and the University of Pennsylvania), and the IMB detector (a collaboration of the University of California, Irvine, the
University of Michigan, and Brookhaven National Laboratory).
Both detectors consisted of large tanks containing thousands of

tons of water. On the rare occasion when a neutrino collided with
one of the water molecules, it produced a brief flash of light. Any
light flash was recorded by photomultiplier tubes lining the walls
of the tank. Because other types of subatomic particles besides
neutrinos could also produce similar light flashes, the detectors
were placed deep underground so that hundreds of meters of
earth would screen out almost all particles except neutrinos. (The
more recent Sudbury Neutrino Observatory, shown in Figure
16-6, has a similar design.)
What causes the light flashes? And how do we know whether
a neutrino comes from a supernova? The key is that a single supernova neutrino carries a relatively large amount of energy, typically 20 MeV or more. (We introduced the unit of energy called
the electron volt, or eV, in Section 5-5. One MeV is equal to 106
electron volts. Only the most energetic nuclear reactions produce
particles with energies of more than 1 MeV.) If such a highenergy neutrino hits a proton in the water-filled tank of a neutrino telescope, the collision produces a positron (see Box 16-1).
The positron then recoils at a speed greater than the speed of light
in water, which is 2.3 ⫻ 105 km/s. (Such motion does not violate
the ultimate speed limit in the universe, 3 ⫻ 105 km/s, which is
the speed of light in a vacuum.)
Just as an airplane that flies faster than sound produces a
shock wave (a sonic boom), a positron that moves through a substance such as water faster than the speed of light in that substance produces a shock wave of light. This shock wave is called
Cerenkov radiation, after the Russian physicist Pavel A. Cerenkov,
who first observed it in 1934. It is this radiation that is detected
by the photomultiplier tubes that line the detector walls.
By measuring the properties of the Cerenkov radiation from
a recoiling positron, scientists can determine the positron’s energy
and, therefore, the energy of the neutrino that created the positron.
This allows them to tell the difference between the high-energy
neutrinos from supernovae and neutrinos from the Sun, which
typically have energies of 1 MeV or less.

Neutrinos from SN 1987A
Both the Kamiokande and IMB detectors were operational on
February 23, 1987, when SN 1987A was first observed in the
Large Magellanic Cloud. Soon afterward, the physicists working
with these detectors excitedly reported that they had detected
Cerenkov flashes from a 12-second burst of neutrinos that reached
the Earth 3 hours before astronomers saw the light from the exploding star. Only a few neutrinos were seen: The Kamiokande
detector saw flashes from 12 neutrinos at about the same time
that 8 were recorded by the IMB detector. But when the physicists factored in the sensitivity of their detectors, they calculated
that Kamiokande and IMB had actually been exposed to a torrent of more than 1016 neutrinos.
Given the flux of neutrinos measured by the detectors and the
distance of 168,000 light-years from SN 1987A to the Earth,
physicists used the inverse-square law to determine the total number of neutrinos that had been emitted from the supernova. (This
law applies to neutrinos just as it does to electromagnetic radiation; see Section 17-2.) They found that over a 10-second period,
SN 1987A emitted 1058 neutrinos with a total energy of 1046
joules. This is more than 100 times as much energy as the Sun has
emitted in its entire history and more than 100 times the amount

Types of Supernovae

Type Ia supernovae, by contrast, are found even in galaxies where
there is no ongoing star formation. Hence, they are probably not
the death throes of massive supergiant stars. Instead, Type Ia supernovae are thought to result from the thermonuclear explosion
of a white dwarf star. This may sound contradictory, because we
saw in Section 20-4 that white dwarf stars have no thermonuclear
reactions going on in their interiors. But these reactions can occur if a carbon-oxygen–rich white dwarf is in a close, semidetached binary system with a red giant star (see Figure 19-20b and
Figure 20-20a).

Astronomers discover dozens of supernovae in distant galaxies
every year, but not all of these are the result of massive stars dying violently. A totally different type of supernova occurs when a
white dwarf star in a binary system blows itself completely apart.

Type Ia Supernovae: Detonating a White Dwarf

20-9 White dwarfs in close binary systems
can also become supernovae

sive stars that still have ample hydrogen in their atmospheres
when they explode. When the star explodes, the hydrogen atoms
are excited and glow prominently, producing hydrogen emission
lines. SN 1987A (the topic of Sections 20-7 and 20-8) and
SN 1993J (shown in Figure 20-16c) were both Type II supernovae.
Hydrogen lines are missing in the spectrum of a Type I supernova, which tells us that little or no hydrogen is left in the debris
from the explosion. Type I supernovae are further divided into
three important subclasses. Type Ia supernovae have spectra that
include a strong absorption line of ionized silicon. Type Ib and
Type Ic supernovae both lack the ionized silicon line. The difference between them is that the spectra of Type Ib supernovae have
a strong helium absorption line, while those of Type Ic supernovae
do not. Figure 20-20 shows these different supernova spectra.
Astronomers suspect that Type Ib and Ic supernovae are
caused by core collapse in dying massive stars, just like Type II
supernovae. The difference is that the progenitor stars of Type Ib
and Ic supernovae have been stripped of their outer layers before
they explode. A star can lose its outer layers to a strong stellar
wind (see Figure 20-12) or, if it is part of a close binary system,
by transferring mass to its companion star (see Figure 19-21b). If
enough mass remains for the star’s core to collapse, the star dies
as a Type Ib supernova. Because the outer layers of hydrogen are
absent, the supernova’s spectrum exhibits no hydrogen lines but
many helium lines (Figure 20-20b). Type Ic supernovae have apparently undergone even more mass loss prior to their explosion;
their spectra show that they have lost much of their helium as
well as their hydrogen (Figure 20-20c).
A key piece of evidence that Type II, Type Ib, and Type Ic
supernovae all begin as massive stars is that all three types are
found only near sites of recent star formation. The life span of a
massive star from its formation to its explosive death as a supernova is only about 107 years, less time than it took our own Sun
to condense from a protostar to a main-sequence star (see Figure
18-10) and a mere blink of an eye on the time scale of stellar evolution. Because massive stars live such a short time, it makes sense
that they should meet their demise very close to where they were
formed.

of energy that the supernova emitted in the form of electromagnetic radiation. Indeed, for a few seconds the supernova’s neutrino luminosity—that is, the rate at which it emitted energy in
the form of neutrinos—was 10 times greater than the total luminosity in electromagnetic radiation of all of the stars in the
observable universe! Such comparisons give a hint of the incomprehensible violence with which a supernova explodes.
Why did the neutrinos from SN 1987A arrive 3 hours before
the first light was seen? As we saw in Section 20-6, neutrinos are
produced when thermonuclear reactions cease in the core of a
massive star and the core collapses. These neutrinos encounter little delay as they pass through the volume of the star. The tremendous increase in the star’s light output, by contrast, occurs only
when the shock wave reaches the star’s outermost layers (which
are thin enough to allow light to pass through them). It took
3 hours for this shock wave to travel outward from the star’s core
to its surface, by which time the neutrino burst was already billions of kilometers beyond the dying star. For the next 168,000
years, the neutrinos that would eventually produce light flashes in
Kamiokande and IMB remained in front of the photons emitted
from the star’s surface, and so the neutrinos were detected before
the supernova’s light. Thus, the neutrino data from SN 1987A
gave astronomers direct confirmation of theoretical ideas about
how supernova explosions take place.
Kamiokande and IMB have both been replaced by a new generation of neutrino telescopes (see Section 16-4). While these new
detectors are intended primarily to observe neutrinos from the
Sun, they are also fully capable of measuring neutrino bursts from
nearby supernovae. Astronomers have identified a number of supergiant stars in our Galaxy that are likely to explode into supernovae, among them the bright red supergiant Betelgeuse in the
constellation Orion (see Figure 2-2 and Figure 6-27).
Unfortunately, astronomers do not yet know how to predict
precisely when such stars will explode into supernovae. It may be
many thousands of years before Betelgeuse explodes. Then again,
it could happen tomorrow. If it does, neutrino telescopes will be
ready to record the collapse of its massive core.

and dumps gas from its outer layers onto the white dwarf (see
Stage 2 in Figure 20-21). When the total mass of the white dwarf
approaches the Chandrasekhar limit, the increased pressure applied to the white dwarf’s interior causes carbon fusion to begin
there (Stage 3 in Figure 20-21). Hence, the interior temperature
of the white dwarf increases.
If the white dwarf were made of ordinary matter, the temperature increase would cause a further increase in pressure, the
white dwarf would expand and cool, and the carbon-fusing reactions would abate. But because the white dwarf is composed of
degenerate matter, this “safety valve” between temperature and
pressure does not operate. Instead, the increased temperature just

makes the reactions proceed at an ever-increasing rate, in a catastrophic runaway process reminiscent of the helium flash in lowmass stars (Stage 4 in Figure 20-21). The reaction spreads rapidly
outward from the white dwarf’s center, with its leading edge
(called the flame front) being propelled by convection and turbulence in a manner analogous to what happens to the shock wave
in a core-collapse supernova. Within seconds the white dwarf
blows apart, dispersing 100% of its mass into space (Stage 5 in
Figure 20-21).
Before exploding, the white dwarf contained primarily carbon and oxygen and almost no hydrogen or helium, which
explains the absence of hydrogen and helium lines in the spectrum

of the resulting supernova. Silicon is a by-product of the carbonfusing reaction and gives rise to the silicon absorption line characteristic of Type Ia supernovae.

CAUTION! Different types of supernovae have fundamentally
different energy sources. We saw in Section 20-6 that corecollapse supernovae (which we have now sorted into Types II,
Ib, and Ic) are powered by gravitational energy released as the
star’s iron-rich core and outer layers fall inward. Type Ia supernovae, by contrast, are powered by nuclear energy released in
the explosive thermonuclear fusion of a white dwarf star. For
this reason we also use the term thermonuclear supernova to refer to a Type Ia supernova. While Type Ia supernovae typically
emit more energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation than

supernovae of other types, they do not emit copious numbers of
neutrinos because there is no core collapse. If we include the energy emitted in the form of neutrinos, the most luminous supernovae by far are those of Type II.

The Decay of a Supernova: Light Curves
In addition to the differences in their spectra, different types of
supernovae can be distinguished by their light curves (Figure
20-22). All supernovae begin with a sudden rise in brightness that
occurs in less than a day. After reaching peak luminosity, Type
Ia, Ib, and Ic supernovae settle into a steady, gradual decline in
luminosity. (An example is the supernova of 1006, which is
thought to have been of Type Ia. This supernova, which at its
peak was more than 200 times brighter than any other star in the

and gradual declines.

sky, took three years to fade into invisibility.) By contrast, the
Type II light curve has a steplike appearance caused by alternating periods of steep and gradual declines in brightness.
For all supernova types, the energy source during the period
of declining brightness is the decay of radioactive isotopes produced during the supernova explosion. Because a different set of
thermonuclear reactions occurs for each type of supernova, each
type produces a unique set of isotopes that decay at different
rates. This helps explains the distinctive light curves for different
supernova types.
For the same reason, each type of supernova ejects a somewhat different mix of elements into the interstellar medium. As
an example, Type Ia supernovae are primarily responsible for the
elements near iron in the periodic table, because they generate
these elements in more copious quantities than Type II supernovae.
A number of astronomers are now measuring the distances to
remote galaxies by looking for Type Ia supernovae in those galaxies. This is possible because there is a simple relationship between
the rate at which a Type Ia supernova fades away and its peak
luminosity: The slower it fades, the greater its luminosity. Hence,
by observing how rapidly a distant Type Ia supernova fades, astronomers can determine its peak luminosity. A measurement of
the supernova’s peak apparent brightness then tells us (through
the inverse-square law) the distance to the supernova, and, therefore, the distance to the supernova’s host galaxy. The tremendous
luminosity of Type Ia supernovae allows this method to be used
for galaxies more than 109 light-years distant. In Chapter 26 we
will learn what such studies tell us about the size and evolution
of the universe as a whole.

Astronomers find the debris of supernova explosions,
called supernova remnants, scattered across the sky. A
beautiful example of a supernova remnant is the Veil
Nebula, shown in Figure 20-23. The doomed star’s outer layers
were blasted into space with such violence that they are still traveling through the interstellar medium

We saw in Section 18-8 that the passage of a supernova remnant through the interstellar medium can
trigger the formation of new stars, so the death of a single massive star (in a core-collapse supernova) or white dwarf (in a thermonuclear supernova) can cause a host of new stars to be born.
A few nearby supernova remnants cover sizable areas of the
sky. The largest is the Gum Nebula, named after the astronomer
Colin Gum, who first noticed its faint glowing wisps on photographs of the southern sky (Figure 20-24). Its 40° angular diameter is centered on the constellation Vela (the Ship’s Sail).

The Veil Nebula—A Supernova Remnant This nebulosity is a portion
of the Cygnus Loop, which is the roughly spherical remnant of a
supernova that exploded about 15,000 years ago. The distance to the
nebula is about 800 pc (2600 ly), and the overall diameter of the loop is
about 35 pc (120 ly). (Palomar Observatory)

in distant galaxies, it is reasonable to suppose that a galaxy such
as our own should have as many as five supernovae per century.
Where have they been?
As we will learn when we study galaxies in Chapters 23 and
24, the plane of our Galaxy is where massive stars are born and
supernovae explode. This region is so rich in interstellar dust,
however, that we simply cannot see very far into space in the directions occupied by the Milky Way (see Section 20-2). In other
words, supernovae probably do in fact erupt every few decades in
remote parts of our Galaxy, but their detonations are hidden
from our view by intervening interstellar matter.

and Black Holes

The Gum Nebula—A Supernova Remnant This nebula has the largest
angular size (40°) of any known supernova remnant. Only the central
regions of the Gum Nebula are shown here. The supernova explosion
occurred about 11,000 years ago, and the remnant now has a diameter of

of the debris from a supernova explosion, they are not called
“supernova remnants.” That term is applied exclusively to the
gas and dust that spreads away from the site of the supernova
explosion.

The Gum Nebula looks big simply because it is quite close to
us. Its center is only about 460 pc (1300 ly) from Earth, and its near
side is just 100 pc (330 ly) away. Studies of the nebula’s expansion
rate suggest that this supernova exploded around 9000 B.C. At
maximum brilliance, the exploding star probably was as bright as
the Moon at first quarter. Like the first quarter moon, it would
have been visible in the daytime!
Many supernova remnants are virtually invisible at optical
wavelengths. However, when the expanding gases collide with the
interstellar medium, they radiate energy at a wide range of wavelengths, from X rays through radio waves. For example, Figure
20-25 shows a radio image of the supernova remnant Cassiopeia
A. (Compare to Figure 18-24, which is a composite of observations of Cassiopeia A at X-ray, visible, and infrared wavelengths.)
As a rule, radio searches for supernova remnants are more fruitful than optical searches. Only two dozen supernova remnants
have been found in visible-light images, but more than 100 remnants have been discovered by radio astronomers.
From the expansion rate of Cassiopeia A, astronomers conclude that this supernova explosion occurred about 300 years
ago. Although telescopes were in wide use by the late 1600s, no
one saw the outburst (and no one today knows why). The last supernova seen in our Galaxy, which occurred in 1604, was observed by Johannes Kepler. In 1572, Tycho Brahe also recorded
the sudden appearance of an exceptionally bright star in the sky.
To find any other accounts of nearby bright supernovae, we must
delve into astronomical records that are almost 1000 years old.
At first glance, this apparent lack of nearby supernovae may
seem puzzling. From the frequency with which supernovae occur

A supernova remnant may be all that is left after some supernovae
explode. But for core-collapse supernovae of Types II, Ib, and Ic,
the core itself may also remain. If there is a relic of the core, it
may be either a neutron star or a black hole, depending on the
mass of the core and the conditions within it during the collapse.
Neutron stars, as the name suggests, are made primarily of neutrons. Wholly unlike anything we have studied so far, these exotic objects are the subject of Chapter 22. We will study black holes,
which are far stranger even than neutron stars, in Chapter 23.

isolated star (one that is not part of a close multiple-star
system) depends on the star’s mass. The more massive the star, the more
rapid its evolution. The scale on the left gives the mass of the star when
it is on the main sequence, and the scale at the right shows the mass of
the resulting stellar corpse. If the star’s initial mass is less than about
0.4 M䉺, it evolves slowly over the eons into an inert ball of helium. If the
initial mass is in the range from about 0.4 M䉺 to about 8 M䉺, it ejects

We have seen in this chapter that only the most massive stars
end their lives as core-collapse supernovae. We learned earlier
that mass plays a central role in determining the speed with which
a star forms and joins the main sequence (see Figure 18-10), the
star’s luminosity and surface temperature while on the main sequence (see Figure 17-21 and the Cosmic Connections figure on
page 459 of Chapter 17), and how long a star can remain on the
main sequence (see Table 19-1). Now we see that a star’s initial
mass also determines its eventual fate (Figure 20-26a).
Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of this rich and varied
story of stellar evolution is that stars are wholly natural phenomena. Beginning with a handful of simple ingredients—hydrogen,
helium, and perhaps a dash of heavier elements—stars evolve into
immense, glowing orbs that shine because one chemical element
naturally converts into another deep in the star’s interior. As they

leaving behind a neutron star or black hole (b) This figure summarizes the
key stages in the cycle of stellar evolution. (b: top inset, Infrared Space

much of their material to interstellar space, where over time it
may spawn new generations of stars (Figure 20-26b). For anyone
who seeks an example of the magnificence and elegance of nature,
a wise piece of advice would be to reflect on the processes of stellar evolution.

• The matter ejected from the supernova, moving at supersonic
speeds through interstellar gases and dust, glows as a nebula
called a supernova remnant.
Other Types of Supernovae: An accreting white dwarf in a close
binary system can also become a supernova when carbon fusion
ignites explosively throughout such a degenerate star. This is
called a thermonuclear supernova.
• A Type Ia supernova is produced by accreting white dwarfs in
close binaries. A Type II supernova is the result of the collapse of
the core of a massive star, as are supernovae of Type Ib and Type
Ic; these latter types occur when the star has lost a substantial
part of its outer layers before exploding.
• Most supernovae occurring in our Galaxy are hidden from our
view by interstellar dust and gases.

Key Ideas
Late Evolution of Low-Mass Stars: A star of moderately low mass
(about 0.4 M䉺 to about 4 M䉺) becomes a red giant when shell
hydrogen fusion begins, a horizontal-branch star when core helium fusion begins, and an asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star
when the helium in the core is exhausted and shell helium fusion
begins.
• As a moderately low-mass star ages, convection occurs over a
larger portion of its volume. This takes heavy elements formed in
the star’s interior and distributes them throughout the star.
Planetary Nebulae and White Dwarfs: Helium shell flashes in an
old, moderately low-mass star produce thermal pulses during
which more than half the star’s mass may be ejected into space.
This exposes the hot carbon-oxygen core of the star.
• Ultraviolet radiation from the exposed core ionizes and excites
the ejected gases, producing a planetary nebula.
• No further nuclear reactions take place within the exposed core.
Instead, it becomes a degenerate, dense sphere about the size of
the Earth and is called a white dwarf. It glows from thermal radiation; as a white dwarf cools, it becomes dimmer.
Late Evolution of High-Mass Stars: Unlike a moderately lowmass star, a high-mass star (initial mass more than about 4 M䉺)
undergoes an extended sequence of thermonuclear reactions in its
core and shells. These include carbon fusion, neon fusion, oxygen
fusion, and silicon fusion.
• In the last stages of its life, a high-mass star has an iron-rich
core surrounded by concentric shells hosting the various thermonuclear reactions. The sequence of thermonuclear reactions
stops here, because the formation of elements heavier than iron
requires an input of energy rather than causing energy to be
released.
The Deaths of the Most Massive Stars: A star with an initial mass
greater than 8 M䉺 dies in a violent cataclysm in which its core
collapses and most of its matter is ejected into space at high
speeds. The luminosity of the star increases suddenly by a factor
of around 108 during this explosion, producing a supernova.
• More than 99% of the energy from a core-collapse supernova
is emitted in the form of neutrinos from the collapsing core.

49. The shock wave that traveled through the progenitor star of
SN 1987A took 3 hours to reach the star’s surface. (a) Given
the size of a blue supergiant star (see Section 20-7), estimate
the speed with which the shock wave traveled through the
star’s outer layers. (The core of the progenitor star was very
small, so you may consider the shock wave to have started at
the very center of the star.) Give your answer in meters per
second. (b) Compare your answer with the speed of sound
waves in our atmosphere, about 340 m/s, and with the speed
of light. (c) A shock wave traveling through a gas is a special
case of a sound wave. In general, sound waves travel faster
through denser, less easily compressed materials. Thus, sound
travels faster through water (about 1500 m/s) than through our
atmosphere, and faster still through steel (about 5900 m/s).

Both objects consist of glowing gases that have expanded
away from a central star. Based on these images, in which of
these objects have the gases expanded more rapidly? Explain

Discussion Questions
58. Suppose that you discover a small, glowing disk of light while
searching the sky with a telescope. How would you decide if
this object is a planetary nebula? Could your object be something else? Explain.
59. Suppose the convective zone in AGB stars did not reach all
the way down into their carbon-rich cores. How might this
have affected the origin and evolution of life on Earth?
60. Imagine that our Sun was somehow replaced by a 1-M䉺
white dwarf star, and that our Earth continued in an orbit of
semimajor axis 1 AU around this star. Discuss what effects
this would have on our planet. What would the white dwarf
look like as seen from Earth? Could you look at it safely with
the unaided eye? Would the Earth’s surface temperature remain the same as it is now?
61. The similar names white dwarf, red dwarf, and brown dwarf
describe three very different kinds of objects. Suggest better
names for these three kinds of objects, and describe how your
names more accurately describe the objects’ properties.
62. The major final product of silicon fusion is 56Fe, an isotope
of iron with 26 protons and 30 neutrons. This is also the
most common isotope of iron found on Earth. Discuss what
this tells you about the origin of the solar system.

Observing tips and tools
While planetary nebulae are rather bright objects, their brightness is spread over a relatively large angular size, which can
make seeing them a challenge for the beginning observer. For
example, the Helix Nebula (shown in the left-hand image on
the page that opens this chapter) has the largest angular size
of any planetary nebula but is also one of the most difficult
to see. To improve your view, make your observations on a
dark, moonless night from a location well shielded from city
lights. Another useful trick, mentioned in Chapters 17 and
18, is to use “averted vision.” Once you have the nebula centered in the telescope, you will get a brighter and clearer image if you look at the nebula out of the corner of your eye.
The so-called Blinking Planetary in Cygnus affords an excellent demonstration of this effect; the nebula seems to disappear when you look straight at it, but it reappears as soon as
you look toward the side of your field of view.
Another useful tip is to view the nebula through a green
filter (a #58, or O III, filter available from telescope supply
houses). Green light is emitted by excited, doubly ionized
oxygen atoms, which are common in planetary nebulae but
not in most other celestial objects. Using such a filter can
make a planetary nebula stand out more distinctly against the
sky. As a side benefit, it also helps to block out stray light
from street lamps. The same tips also apply to observing supernova remnants.
69. Although they represent a fleeting stage at the end of a star’s
life, planetary nebulae are found all across the sky. Some of
the brightest are listed in the accompanying table. Note that
the distances to most of these nebulae are quite uncertain.
Observe as many of these planetary nebulae as you can on a
clear, moonless night using the largest telescope at your disposal. Note and compare the various shapes of the different
nebulae. In how many cases can you see the central star? The
central star in the Eskimo Nebula is supposed to be the
“nose” of an Eskimo wearing a parka. Can you see this
pattern?
70. Northern hemisphere observers with modest telescopes can
see two supernova remnants, one in the winter sky and the
other in the summer sky. Both are quite faint, however, so
you should schedule your observations for a moonless night.

lmost all the light we see from objects in the night sky is
due to thermonuclear fusion reactions. Such reactions are
what make stars shine, and in turn make any surrounding
nebulae glow. Even the light we see from the Moon and planets—
which is simply reflected sunlight—can be traced back to thermonuclear reactions in the Sun’s core.
By contrast, the exotic object shown here—the Crab Nebula
in Taurus—is undergoing no thermonuclear fusion at all. Despite
this, the object is so energetic that it is emitting copious amounts
of X rays. This image shows tilted, glowing rings more than a
light-year across, with oppositely directed jets flowing outward
perpendicular to the plane of the rings. At the object’s very center, too small to pick out in this image, is the source of all this
dynamic activity: a neutron star, the leftover core of what was
once a supergiant star.
Before 1967 neutron stars were considered pure speculation.
But today we know of more than 1300 of these exotic stellar
corpses, and hundreds of thousands more may be strewn across
the Milky Way Galaxy. As we will discover in this chapter, neutron stars have powerful magnetic fields that are billions of times
stronger than the Sun’s field. As a neutron star rotates, its magnetic field sweeps beams of radiation across the sky. We detect
these beams as pulsating radio signals.
Unlike normal stars, neutron stars actually have solid surfaces that can shift and fracture in a “starquake.” When such a
quake occurs on the surface of a neutron star with an unusually
strong magnetic field, it releases a truly colossal burst of radiation that for a fraction of a second outshines an entire galaxy
of stars.

We will find that neutron stars in close binary systems also
display outrageous behavior, including bouts of explosive helium
fusion that yield a vast outpouring of X rays. As we will see, a
similar process involving a white dwarf in a close binary system
produces a short-lived intense burst of visible light called a nova.

stimulated interest in neutron stars

INK 2

As a young graduate student at Cambridge University, Jocelyn Bell spent many months helping construct an array of radio antennas covering 41/2 acres
of the English countryside. The instrument was completed by
the summer of 1967, and Bell and her colleagues in Anthony
Hewish’s research group began using it to scrutinize radio emissions from the sky. They were looking for radio sources that
“twinkle” like stars; that is, they looked for random small fluctuations in brightness caused by the motion of gas between the
source and the observer. What they discovered was something
far more exotic.

describe this object, and works of art made by the Anasazi culture in the American Southwest suggest that they may have seen
it as well (Figure 21-1). Over the next 21 months, however, the
“guest star” faded to invisibility.
We now know that the “guest star” of 1054 was actually a
remarkable stellar transformation: A massive star some 6500
light-years away perished in a supernova explosion, leaving behind both a supernova remnant (see Figure 1-8 and Section
20-10) and a bizarre object called a neutron star—an incredibly
dense sphere composed primarily of neutrons. However, it took
many centuries after Yang Wei-T’e’s observations to understand
what had happened; it was not until 1932 that the neutron itself
was discovered by the English physicist James Chadwick. (We
learned in Section 5-7 that the neutron has about the same mass
as the positively charged proton, but has no electric charge.)
We saw in Section 20-6 that under very high pressure, a proton and an electron can combine to form a neutron (as well as a
neutrino). Could such pressures be found within the core of a dying high-mass star? Within a year of Chadwick’s discovery, astronomers Fritz Zwicky at the California Institute of Technology
(Caltech) and his colleague Walter Baade at Mount Wilson Observatory made just this prediction—that a massive stellar core
can transform into a sphere of neutrons. “With all reserve,”
Zwicky and Baade theorized, “we advance the view that supernovae represent the transition from ordinary stars into neutron
stars, which in their final stages consist of extremely closely
packed neutrons.” In other words, there could be at least two
types of stellar corpses—white dwarfs and neutron stars.

Zwicky and Baade realized that once a neutron star had
formed in response to tremendous pressures, it would be able to
resist any further compression. The neutrons themselves would
provide a counterbalancing outward
pressure. Motivated by the idea that Although neutron stars
white dwarfs are supported by de- were first hypothesized

in the 1930s, the idea
and Baade proposed that a highly
seemed so strange that
compact ball of neutrons would similarly produce a degenerate neutron it was ignored for over
pressure. (Like electrons, neutrons thirty years
obey the Pauli exclusion principle
that we described in Section 19-3.) This powerful pressure could
support a stellar corpse—perhaps one even more massive than a
white dwarf, because degenerate neutron pressure can be much
stronger than degenerate electron pressure. So, while a white
dwarf collapses if its mass is above the Chandrasekhar limit (see
Section 20-4), a neutron star might not.
Although Zwicky and Baade’s proposal would prove to be
very close to the mark, most scientists politely ignored it for years.
After all, a neutron star must be a rather weird object. If brought
to the Earth’s surface, a single thimbleful of neutron star matter
would weigh 100 million tons!
A star compacted to such densities must be very small. A
1.4-M䉺 neutron star would have a diameter of only 20 km
(12 mi), about the size of a moderate-sized city on Earth. Its surface gravity would be so strong that an object would have to
travel at one-half the speed of light to escape into space. These
conditions seemed outrageous until the late 1960s, when astronomers discovered pulsating radio sources.

The Discovery of Pulsars
While searching for random flickering, Bell noticed that the antennas had detected regular pulses of radio noise from one particular location in the sky. These radio pulses were arriving at
regular intervals of 1.3373011 seconds—much more rapid than
those of any other astronomical object known at that time. Indeed, they were so rapid and regular that the Cambridge team at
first suspected that they might not be of natural origin. Instead,
it was proposed that these pulses might be signals from an advanced alien civilization.

A Recording of a Pulsar This chart recording shows the
intensity of radio emission from one of the first pulsars to be
discovered. (The designation means “pulsar at a right ascension of 03h
29m and a declination of ⫹54° ”) Note that the interval between pulses is
very regular, even though some pulses are weak and others are strong.
(Adapted from R. N. Manchester and J. H. Taylor)

That possibility had to be discarded within a few months after several more of these pulsating radio sources, which came to
be called pulsars, were discovered across the sky. In all cases, the
periods were extremely regular, ranging from about 0.25 second
for the fastest to about 1.5 seconds for the slowest (Figure 21-2).

Ruling Out Possibilities
What could these objects possibly be? As is often done in science,
astronomers first decided what pulsars could not be. It was clear
that pulsars were not ordinary stars or nebulae, because while
these objects emit some radio waves, their emissions do not pulsate (that is, their light output does not increase and decrease
rhythmically). One type of star that appears to pulsate is an eclipsing binary star system, which appears dimmer when one star in
the binary system passes in front of the other (see Section 17-11).
However, in order to vary in brightness with a typical pulsar period of 1 second or less, an eclipsing binary would have to have
an equally short orbital period. Newton’s form of Kepler’s third
law (see Section 4-7) implies that the two stars would have to orbit only 1000 kilometers or so from each other. This is less than
the diameter of any ordinary star, even a white dwarf star. Hence,
the eclipsing binary hypothesis can be ruled out, because it leads
to the highly implausible picture of two stars that overlap!
Astronomers also ruled out the idea that pulsars might be
variable stars, which vary in luminosity as they increase and decrease in size (see Section 19-6). Pulsating variables have periods
of days or weeks, while pulsars have periods of seconds or less.
Just as the broad wings of an eagle could never flap as fast as a
hummingbird’s wings without breaking, an ordinary star or even
a white dwarf is too large to pulsate in and out in less than a
second.
Another possibility, however, was given serious consideration. Perhaps pulsars were rapidly rotating white dwarf stars with
some sort of radio-emitting “hot spots” on their surfaces. But
even this model had its limits, because a white dwarf that rotated
on its axis in just 1 second would be on the verge of flying apart.
What finally ruled out the spinning white dwarf model was the
discovery of a pulsar in the middle of the Crab Nebula, the su-

557

pernova remnant left behind by the supernova that Yang Wei-T’e
saw in 1054 (see Figure 1-8). That discovery clarified the true nature of pulsars.
At the time of its discovery, the Crab pulsar was the fastest
pulsar known to astronomers. Its period is 0.0333 second, which
means that it flashes 1/0.0333 ⫽ 30

fast without tearing itself apart. evolution
Hence, the existence of the Crab pulsar means that the stellar corpse at the center of the Crab Nebula has to be much smaller and more compact than a white dwarf.
This was a truly unsettling realization, because most astronomers in the mid-1960s thought that all stellar corpses are
white dwarfs. The number of white dwarfs in the sky seemed to
account for all the stars that must have died since our Galaxy was
formed. It was generally assumed that all dying stars—even the
most massive ones, which produce supernovae—somehow manage to eject enough matter so that their corpses do not exceed the
Chandrasekhar limit. But the discovery of the Crab pulsar showed
these conservative opinions to be in error.
It was now clear that pulsars had to be something far more
exotic than rotating white dwarfs. As Thomas Gold of Cornell
University emphasized, astronomers would now have to seriously
consider the existence of neutron stars.

21-3 Pulsars are rapidly rotating neutron
stars with intense magnetic fields
Science is, by its very nature, based on skepticism. If a scientist
proposes a new and exotic explanation for an unexplained phenomenon, that explanation will be accepted only if it satisfies two
demanding criteria. First, there must be excellent reasons why
more conventional explanations cannot work. Second, the new
explanation must help scientists understand a range of other
phenomena.
A good example is the Copernican idea that the Earth orbits
the Sun, which gained general acceptance only after Galileo’s observations (see Section 4-5). First, Galileo showed the older geocentric explanation of celestial motions to be untenable, and,
second, it became clear that the Copernican model could also explain the motions of Jupiter’s moons.

How the Neutron-Star Model Overcame Skepticism
We have seen how the discovery of the Crab pulsar ruled out the
idea that pulsars were white dwarfs. But astronomers soon accepted the more exotic idea that pulsars were actually neutron
stars. To understand why, we must assume the skeptical outlook
of the scientist and ask some probing questions about this idea.
Why should neutron stars emit radiation at all? In particular, why
should they emit radio waves? Why should the emissions be
pulsed? And how could the pulses occur as rapidly as 30 times

558

Chapter 21

per second, as in the Crab pulsar? The answers to all of these
questions are intimately related to the small size of neutron stars.

Because neutron stars are very small, they should also
rotate rapidly. A typical star, such as our Sun, takes
nearly a full month to rotate once about its axis.
But just as an ice skater doing a pirouette speeds up when she
pulls in her arms, a collapsing star
also speeds up as its size shrinks. The neutron-star model
(We introduced this principle, called
of pulsars had to pass
the conservation of angular momentum, in Section 8-4.) If our Sun were several stringent tests to
compressed to the size of a neutron be accepted by
star, it would spin about 1000 times astronomers
per second! Because neutron stars
are so small and dense, they can spin this rapidly without flying
apart.
The small size of neutron stars also implies that they have intense magnetic fields. It seems safe to say that every star possesses
some magnetic field, but typically the strength of this field is quite
low. The magnetic field of a main-sequence star is spread out over
billions of square kilometers of the star’s surface. However, if
such a star collapses down to a neutron star, its surface area
(which is proportional to the square of its radius) shrinks by a
factor of about 1010. The magnetic field, which is bonded to the
star’s ionized gases (see Section 16-9), becomes concentrated onto

an area 1010 times smaller than before the collapse, and thus the
field strength increases by a factor of 1010.
A star’s magnetic field splits one of its spectral lines into two
or more lines whose spacing reveals the field’s strength (see
Figure 16-20). The strength of a magnetic field is usually measured in the unit called the gauss (G), named after the famous
German mathematician and astronomer Karl Friedrich Gauss. (As
an example, the Earth’s magnetic field has a strength of about
0.5 G. The field at the surface of a refrigerator magnet is about
100 G, and the field used in an MRI scanner is about 15,000 G.)
The magnetic splitting of lines in the spectra of main-sequence
stars reveals field strengths in the range from about 1 G (the value
for the Sun) to several thousand gauss. The splitting of lines in
the spectra of certain white dwarfs corresponds to field strengths
in excess of 106 G, comparable to the strongest fields ever produced in a laboratory on Earth. But the magnetic fields surrounding typical neutron stars are a million times stronger still, on the
order of 1 trillion gauss (1012 G). As we will see in Section 21-6,
some neutron stars may have fields as strong as 1015 G.
The magnetic field of a neutron star makes it possible for the
star to radiate pulses of energy toward our telescopes. A number
of different models have been proposed for how rotating neutron
stars generate radiation; we’ll discuss just one leading model. The
idea behind this model is that the magnetic axis of a neutron star,
the line connecting the north and south magnetic poles, is likely
to be inclined at an angle to the rotation axis (Figure 21-3a). After

Figure 21-3
A Rotating, Magnetized Neutron Star Charged particles are
accelerated near a magnetized neutron star’s magnetic poles (labeled
N and S), producing two oppositely directed beams of radiation. If the
star’s magnetic axis (a line that connects the north and south magnetic

poles) is tilted at an angle from the axis of rotation, as shown here, the
beams sweep around the sky as the star rotates. If the Earth happens to
lie in the path of one of the beams, we detect radiation that appears to
pulse (a) on and (b) off.

Neutron Stars

ANALOGY A rotating, magnetized neutron star is somewhat
like a lighthouse beacon. As the star rotates, the beams of radiation sweep around the sky. If at some point during the rotation
one of those beams happens to point toward the Earth, as shown
in Figure 21-3a, we will detect a brief flash as the beam sweeps
over us. At other points during the rotation the beam will be

pointed away from Earth and the radiation from the neutron
star will appear to have turned off (Figure 21-3b). Hence, a radio telescope will detect regular pulses of radiation, with one
pulse being received for each rotation of the neutron star.

CAUTION! The name pulsar may lead you to think that the
source of radio waves is actually pulsing. But in the model just
described, this is not the case at all. Instead, beams of radiation
are emitted continuously from the magnetic poles of the neutron
star. The pulsing that astronomers detect here on the Earth is
simply a result of the rapid rotation of the neutron star, which
brings one of the beams periodically into our line of sight, as
Figure 21-3 shows. In this sense, the analogy between a pulsar
and a lighthouse beacon is a very close one.

Soon after the rotating neutron star model of pulsars
was proposed in the late 1960s, a team of astronomers
at the University of Arizona began wondering if pulsars might also emit pulses at wavelengths other than the radio
part of the spectrum. To investigate, they began a search for
visible-light pulses from the Crab pulsar (Figure 21-4). They aimed
a telescope at the center of the Crab Nebula (Figure 21-4a), then
used a spinning disk with a slit in it to “chop,” or interrupt,

all, there is no fundamental reason for these two axes to coincide.
(Indeed, these two axes do not coincide for any of the planets of
our solar system.)
In 1969, Peter Goldreich at Caltech pointed out that the combination of such a powerful magnetic field and rapid rotation
would act like a giant electric generator, creating very strong electric fields near the neutron star’s surface. Indeed, these fields are
so intense that part of their energy is used to create electrons and
positrons out of nothingness in a process called pair production.
The powerful electric fields push these charged particles out from
the neutron star’s surface and into its curved magnetic field, as
sketched in Figure 21-3a. As the particles spiral along the curved
field, they are accelerated and emit energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation. (A radio transmission antenna works in a
similar way. Electrons are accelerated back and forth along the
length of the antenna, producing radio waves.) The result is that
two narrow beams of radiation pour out of the neutron star’s
north and south magnetic polar regions.

incoming light at rapid intervals. To their surprise and delight,
they found that one of the stars at the center of the nebula appears to be flashing on and off 30 times each second (Figure
21-4b)—exactly the same pulse rate as observed with radio waves.
This observation was strong evidence in favor of pulsars being rotating, magnetized neutron stars, because charged particles
accelerating in a magnetic field can radiate strongly over a very
wide range of wavelengths. By contrast, the blackbody radiation
from an ordinary star, which has a surface temperature in thousands of degrees, is very weak at radio wavelengths. (The Sun’s
weak radio emissions come not from its glowing surface but
rather from charged particles spiraling in the solar magnetic field.)
Since the pioneering days of the 1960s, periodic flashes of radiation have been detected from the Crab pulsar at still other
wavelengths, including X rays (Figure 21-4c). The pulsar period
is the same at all wavelengths, just as we would expect if the emissions are coming from a portion of the neutron star, which comes
into view periodically as the star rotates.

The many successes of the neutron-star model of pulsars led to the rapid acceptance of the model. Since
1968 radio astronomers have discovered more than
1600 pulsars scattered across the sky, and it is estimated that perhaps 105 more are strewn around the disk of the Milky Way
Galaxy. Each one is presumed to be the neutron star corpse of an
extinct, massive star. Radio telescopes have detected pulsars with
a wide variety of pulse periods, from a relatively sluggish 8.51 s
to a blindingly fast 0.001396 s. In each case the pulse period is
thought to be the same as the rotation period of the neutron star.

The Pulsar-Supernova Connection
The primary sources of pulsars are thought to be massive stars
that become core-collapse supernovae (as described in Section
20-6). The supernova seen in 1054 that left behind the Crab Nebula and the Crab pulsar is thought to have been a Type II corecollapse supernova. However, not all supernovae leave pulsars
amid their debris. For example, the supernovae observed by
Tycho Brahe in 1572 and by Johannes Kepler in 1604 were probably thermonuclear supernovae in which a white dwarf in a binary system underwent a catastrophic explosion (see Section
20-9). It is difficult to imagine how the complete disruption of a
white dwarf could produce a neutron star. Indeed, no pulsar has
been found at the locations of either of those supernovae.
In many cases pulsars are found within the remnant of the
supernova that spawned the pulsar. One example is the Crab pulsar, which is not far from the center of the Crab Nebula. This is
what we might expect: When the progenitor star of the supernova
of 1054 exploded, its core remained at the center of the explosion and became a rotating neutron star, while the star’s outer
layers were blasted into space to form the nebula. However,
Figure 21-5 shows a pulsar that lies outside its supernova remnant and is moving away from the remnant at hundreds of kilometers per second. It appears that when the progenitor star
collapsed and exploded into a supernova, the explosion was much
more powerful on one side of the core than the other. As a result,
the core was sent flying at immense speed. Many such fastmoving pulsars have been observed, which suggests that supernova explosions are often asymmetrical. In this way studies of
pulsars have given us new insights into the nature of supernovae.

Rotational Energy as a Power Source
In 1966, two years before the discovery of pulsars, John A.
Wheeler at Princeton University and Franco Pacini in Italy speculated that the ultimate source of the
Crab Nebula’s immense energy out- The energy in a neutron
put might be the spin of a neutron
star’s rotation provides
star inside the nebula. In a kitchen
blender, the energy of a rapidly spin- the power for its intense
ning blade is used to chop food or pulsar radiation
mix beverages. Wheeler and Pacini
proposed that the even greater energy of a rapidly spinning neutron star—which can rotate as rapidly as the blade in a blender,
but has far more energy thanks to its much larger mass and
radius—can provide the energy to light up the Crab Nebula.
Wheeler and Pacini’s speculation was quickly accepted as the
correct explanation of the Crab Nebula’s luminosity. What confirmed their idea were two discoveries: first, that there is a pulsar
within the Crab Nebula, and second, that the Crab pulsar is slowing down.
Although pulsars were first noted for their very regular pulses,
careful measurements by radio telescopes soon revealed that the
rotation period of a typical pulsar—that is, the time for it to spin
once on its axis—increases by a few billionths of a second each
day. The Crab pulsar, which is one of the most rapidly rotating
pulsars, is also slowing more quickly than most—its period increases by 3.8 ⫻ 10⫺8 second each day. Thirty billionths of a second may sound trivial, but there is so much energy in the rotation

Synchrotron Radiation
The interpretation is that the energy lost by the Crab pulsar as it
slows down is transferred to the surrounding nebula. But how
does this transfer of energy take place, and how is the energy radiated into space? The answer lies in the diffuse part of the Crab
Nebula, which shines with an eerie bluish light (see Figure 21-4a).
This type of light was first produced on the Earth in 1947 in a
particle accelerator in Schenectady, New York. This machine,
called a synchrotron, was built by the General Electric Company
to accelerate electrons to nearly the speed of light for experiments
in nuclear physics. (The electrons are said to be relativistic, because their velocities are near the speed of light, and Einstein’s
theory of relativity—which we discuss in Chapter 22—must be
applied to understand their motions.)
BL

INK 2

As a beam of electrons whirled along a circular path
within the cyclotron, held in orbit by powerful magnets, scientists noticed that it emitted a strange light. It
is now known that this light, called synchrotron radiation, is
emitted whenever high-speed electrons move along curved paths
through a magnetic field (Figure 21-6a). Synchrotron radiation
has a continuous spectrum, but one that is distinctively different
from the continuous spectrum emitted by a heated blackbody
(Figure 21-6b). This difference helped astronomers confirm that
the Crab Nebula emits primarily synchrotron radiation, not blackbody radiation.
The total energy output of the Crab Nebula in synchrotron
radiation is 3 ⫻ 1031 watts, compared to the relatively paltry
4 ⫻ 1026 watts emitted by the Sun. Thus, the Crab Nebula must
contain quite a large number of relativistic electrons spiraling in
an extensive magnetic field. Figure 21-7 shows where these electrons come from: They are ejected from the neutron star’s vicinity, forming immense jets that emanate from the star’s poles and
rings that spread outward from its equator. (Figure 18-16 shows
a related process that produces jets from young stars.) As the
Crab pulsar slows, the energy of its rotation is transferred to these
electrons through the magnetic field and is then emitted by them
in the form of synchrotron radiation. So much energy is transferred in this way that the Crab Nebula shines very brightly.
This model for the luminosity of the Crab Nebula also provides a check on our ideas about the magnetic fields of neutron
stars (Section 21-3). The stronger the magnetic field of a neutron
star, the greater the rate at which it emits energy in the form of
radiation and hence the more rapidly it will slow down. From the
slowdown rate of the Crab pulsar, astronomers calculate that its
magnetic field must be about 5 ⫻ 1012 G. This is very close to the
estimate of 1012 G that we obtained in Section 21-3.
1.9

As remarkable as the Crab pulsar is, the Crab Nebula
that surrounds it is even more so. Although the nebula
is 2000 pc (6500 ly) away, it can be spotted in dark
skies with even a small telescope. It shines with a luminosity
75,000 times that of the Sun (and some 108 times the luminosity
of the pulses from the Crab pulsar).
But why is the Crab Nebula so luminous? Certain other
nebulae—the H II regions described in Section 18-2—can also be
seen at great distances. But H II regions contain young stars that
shine because of rapid thermonuclear reactions in their cores.
These reactions heat the star’s surfaces to such high temperatures
that they give off prodigious amounts of ultraviolet radiation.
This radiation ionizes the surrounding gas and provides the energy that the H II region emits into space. The Crab Nebula, however, is different from H II regions: It contains no young stars,
and there are no thermonuclear reactions taking place within the
neutron star that lies at the nebula’s heart. What, then, is the
source of this nebula’s prodigious energy output? As we will see,
the Crab pulsar provides the energy not only for radio pulses but
for the entire Crab Nebula.

of a rapidly spinning neutron star that even the slightest slowdown corresponds to a tremendous loss of energy. In fact, the observed rate of slowing for the Crab pulsar corresponds to a rate
of energy loss equal to the entire luminosity of the Crab Nebula.

WE

The most intensely studied of all recent core-collapse supernovae is the great supernova of 1987 (SN 1987A, described in
Section 20-7). Astronomers have been carefully observing its remains for signs of a pulsar. To date, however, no confirmed observations of pulses have been made, and the search for a pulsar
in SN 1987A goes on.

Aging Pulsars
Because a spinning neutron star slows down as it radiates away
its rotational energy, it follows that an old neutron star should be
spinning more slowly than a young one. It is thought that slower
pulsars were formed in supernova explosions that occurred hundreds of thousands of years ago. Over the ages, the supernova

remnants have dispersed into the interstellar medium, and the
pulsars left behind have slowed to periods of a second or more.
(More than 400 such old pulsars are known.) Only relatively
young, rapidly rotating pulsars like the Crab pulsar have enough
energy to emit flashes of visible light along with radio pulses (see
Figure 21-4b). We can summarize these ideas as a general rule:

Fast-moving material from the
pulsar creates shock waves,
forming X-ray–emitting rings.

An isolated pulsar slows down as it ages, so its pulse
period increases.
From a pulsar’s period (which increases as it ages) and the
rate at which its period is increasing (which decreases as it ages),
astronomers can estimate how old a pulsar is.
Like all general rules, the one relating a pulsar’s age and its
period has exceptions. In Section 21-7 we will see how some old
pulsars that are not isolated—that is, are members of binary star
systems—can be reaccelerated to truly dizzying rotation speeds.

21-5 Superfluidity and superconductivity are
among the strange properties of neutron stars
The radiation from pulsars gives us information about the surroundings of neutron stars, as well as how they rotate. To deduce
what conditions are like inside a neutron star, however, astrophysicists must construct theoretical models. We saw examples of
such models for the Sun in Section 16-2 and for post–mainsequence stars in Sections 20-1 and 20-5.

Superfluidity and Pulsar Glitches
The models for neutron stars are very different. For one thing,
neutron stars are thought to have a solid crust on their surface.

A Pulsar Glitch This graph shows how the period of the Vela pulsar
varied during 1975 and 1976. Most of the time the neutron star’s rotation
slowed as its rotational energy was converted into radiation. In September
1975, however, a sudden speedup (glitch) occurred. A number of pulsars
have been observed to undergo multiple glitches at intervals of a few years.

The Ultimate Electric Conductor
Superfluidity is not the only exotic property of neutron star interiors. Models of the internal structure of a neutron star strongly
suggest that the protons in the core can move around without experiencing any electrical resistance whatsoever. This phenomenon, called superconductivity, also occurs on the Earth with
certain substances at low temperatures. In a normal conductor of
electricity such as the copper wires in a flashlight, an electric current only flows if there is a battery in the flashlight circuit to overcome the resistance of the wires. Once the battery goes “dead,”
the current stops and the flashlight turns off. Once you start an
electric current moving in a superconducting material, however,
it keeps moving forever.

CAUTION! You may have been surprised to read in the preceding paragraph about protons in a neutron star. While a neutron
star is made up predominantly of neutrons, some protons and
electrons must be scattered throughout the star’s interior. Indeed, a pulsar’s magnetic field must be anchored to the neutron
star by charged particles. Neutrons are electrically neutral, so
without the protons and electrons in its interior a neutron star
would rapidly lose its magnetic field.
As Figure 21-9 shows, the structure of a neutron star probably
consists of a core with superfluid neutrons and superconducting

Furthermore, the interior of a neutron star is a sea of densely
packed, degenerate neutrons, with properties quite unlike those of
ordinary gases or even degenerate electrons. Detailed calculations

any friction whatsoever, a phenomenon called superfluidity.

fluid liquid helium exhibits strange
properties such as being able to creep up the walls of a container
in apparent defiance of gravity. Within a neutron star, elongated,
friction-free whirlpools of superfluid neutrons may form. Their
interaction with the star’s crust may be the cause of sudden
changes in a pulsar’s rotation.
In addition to the general slowing down of pulsars, astronomers have found that they sometimes exhibit a sudden
speedup, sometimes called a glitch. For example, Figure 21-8
shows measurements of the period of the Vela pulsar (named for
the constellation in which it lies) during 1975 and 1976. On this
graph, the pulsar’s gradual slowdown is shown as a steady increase in its period. In September 1975, however, there was an
abrupt speedup, after which the pulsar continued to slow down
at its usual rate. Similar glitches are seen for other pulsars.
Current opinion among pulsar theorists is that glitches are
caused by the superfluid neutrons within the neutron star. As a rotating neutron star radiates energy into space, the rotation of its
crust slows down, but the neutron whirlpools in the star’s interior
continue to rotate with the same speed. Some of these whirlpools
cling to the crust, as though they were bungee cords with one end
attached to the crust and the other to the star’s interior. As the

crust slows down relative to the interior, these superfluid “bungee
cords” stretch out. When the tension in them gets too great, they
deliver a sharp jolt that makes the crust speed up suddenly. (An
older model, in which pulsar glitches were caused by a “starquake” in the neutron star’s settling crust, does not appear to
agree with the accumulated observational data on glitches.)

Evidence for a Neutron-Star Atmosphere (a) This image

from XMM-Newton (see Figure 6-30b) shows a neutron star
roughly 2000 pc (7000 ly) from Earth in the constellation Centaurus. Like
the Crab pulsar (Figure 21-4a), this neutron star is an X-ray–emitting

protons, a mantle of superfluid neutrons in which some of the
neutrons combine with protons to form nuclei, and a brittle crust
less than a kilometer thick. At the center of a neutron star, the
density is on the order of 1018 kg/m3. This is some 10 trillion
(1013) times greater than the central density of our present-day
Sun and approximately twice the density of an atomic nucleus. It
has been speculated that under these conditions the neutrons and
protons dissolve into more fundamental particles called quarks.
To date, however, astronomers have not found conclusive observational evidence of such extreme states of matter within neutron
stars.

Neutron Star Atmospheres

atmosphere must be dramatically different from those around
you: In the intense magnetic field of a young neutron star, ordinarily spherical atoms are deformed into elongated cigar shapes
and have radically altered spectral lines.
The bizarre properties of neutron star interiors and atmospheres are of great interest to astronomers and physicists precisely because they are so bizarre. Just as physicians learn about
health by studying disease, scientists gain insight into the fundamental nature of matter by studying its behavior under extreme
conditions.

While the deep interiors of neutron stars remain mysterious, astronomers have recently found evidence that the crusts of neutron

Astronomers Robert Duncan and Christopher Thompson developed the theory of highly magnetized neutron
stars, or magnetars, in 1992. In their theory the magnetic field of a magnetar exerts tremendous stresses on the electrically conducting material at the star’s surface (see Figure 21-9).
From time to time these stresses can
cause a localized fracture of the sur- A starquake on the

starquake responds by rearranging
itself in a process that resembles in the form of an intense
magnetic reconnection in the Sun’s blast of X rays and
magnetic field (see Figure 16-25) but gamma rays
is much more energetic. The energy
released by such a localized starquake produces a moderate burst
of gamma rays. But on rare occasions the crust can fracture simultaneously over much of the magnetar’s surface. In such a catastrophic event the star’s magnetic field undergoes a dramatic
rearrangement that releases an immense amount of magnetic energy. The result is a short-lived but titanic blast of gamma rays
and X rays.

triangulate the point in space from which the radiation emanated.
The source proved to be a pulsar designated SGR 1806-20 that
lies about 15,000 parsecs (50,000 light-years) from Earth in the
constellation Sagittarius. For the spacecraft to detect such intense
radiation from a source so far away, the pulsar’s luminosity during the time it was emitting the burst must have been a staggering 1014 times greater than the luminosity of the Sun. It would
take the Sun 300,000 years to radiate as much energy as SGR
1806-20 emitted in just 0.2 second!
How could a pulsar release such a stupendous amount of energy in such a brief amount of time? If the energy source were the
rotation of a neutron star, as it is for the Crab Nebula, the neutron star’s spin would have slowed appreciably after emitting the
radiation burst. But observations of the pulsar made before and
after the burst showed the same pulse period of 7.47 seconds.
Since the pulse period and rotation rate are the same (see Figure
21-3), this means that the rotation did not slow at all. What is
more, the total rotational energy of a neutron star spinning once
every 7.47 seconds is only about 1% of the energy that was released as radiation in the 0.2-second burst. Hence, the neutron
star’s rotation could not have supplied the immense release of energy seen on December 27, 2004.
Short bursts of radiation that were nearly as intense as that
seen from SGR 1806-20 have been detected from two other pulsars, one (SGR 0526-66) in 1979 and one (SGR 1900⫹14) in
1998. Like SGR 1806-20, neither of these pulsars showed any appreciable slowing after emitting their bursts, so their rotational
energy could not have been the source of the bursts. To explain
all three of these exotic events, astronomers have turned to another distinguishing characteristic of a pulsar: the neutron star’s
intense magnetic field. As we will see, the three pulsars in question appear to have the strongest magnetic fields of any object in
the universe, far stronger than those of “ordinary” pulsars.

565

Observing Magnetars
Magnetars and Starquakes
The magnetic field of an ordinary star such as the Sun is produced
by the motion of its electrically conducting gas, or plasma (see
Section 16-9). The same is true for a supergiant star. We saw in
Section 21-3 that when thermonuclear reactions cease in a supergiant star and it begins to collapse, the star’s magnetic field moves
with the infalling material and becomes greatly amplified. This
amplified magnetic field remains with the resulting neutron star,
which typically ends up with a field strength of about 1012 G.
However, a neutron star can generate an additional magnetic
field as it forms. For about the first 10 seconds after a neutron
star forms from the core of a collapsing supergiant, it has an extremely high internal temperature—about 1011 K, as compared to
a relatively frigid 1.55 ⫻ 107 K in the present-day Sun’s core—
and there is furious convection of the neutron star material. This
material includes electrically charged protons and electrons, and
the convective motions produce a magnetic field. If the newly
formed neutron star spins relatively slowly, so that the time it
takes a convection cell to rise and fall (about 0.005 s) is less than
the time required for the neutron star to make a complete rotation, the magnetic fields caused by different convection cells remain uncorrelated and do not contribute much to the neutron
star’s magnetism. This seems to be what happens for the vast ma-

The theoretical model of a magnetar turns out to be an excellent
description of the three pulsars that produced the energetic blasts
observed in 1979, 1998, and 2004. Each of these pulsars emits
moderate gamma-ray bursts at seemingly random intervals, which
is why they are also called soft gamma repeaters. This is the origin of the acronym “SGR” in the pulsars’ designations. (The adjective “soft” means that the gamma rays emitted are of relatively
low energy.) According to Duncan and Thompson’s model, each
such burst is caused by a localized starquake on a magnetar; the
truly stupendous bursts are the result of rare quakes that span
much of the magnetar’s surface.
How can we test these radical ideas? As we saw in Section
21-4, the rate at which a pulsar slows down is a measure of its magnetic field. In 1998 the Greek astronomer Chryssa Kouveliotou
determined that over the preceding 5 years the pulse period of
SGR 1806-20 had increased by 0.008 seconds. (This is a small

How magnetar bursts happen
The magentic field of a magnetar is so strong that the rigid crust sometimes breaks and crumbles, releasing a huge surge of energy.

• A burst from a magnetar 15,000 parsecs away was observed on
December 27, 2004.
• This burst was so intense that it caused a major disturbance of the
Earth’s upper atmosphere.
• During the 0.2-second duration of the burst, the magnetar’s luminosity
was more than 100 times the total luminosity of the Milky Way Galaxy.
• It is estimated that this blast ripped away a layer of the magnetar’s
crust about 50 meters thick.

Neutron Stars

21-7 The fastest pulsars were probably
created by mass transfer in close
binary systems
In 1982, radio astronomers discovered a pulsar whose period is
only 1.558 ms. (One millisecond, or 1 ms, equals a thousandth of
a second). This remarkable pulsar,
called PSR 1937⫹21 after its coordinates in the sky, is a neutron star The fastest pulsars spin
spinning 642 times per second— nearly a thousand times
about 3 times faster than the blades per second, more than
of a kitchen blender! Such incredibly twice as fast as a kitchen
rapid rotation is a clue to this pulblender
sar’s unusual history.
As we have seen, pulsars should slow down as they age. The
rapid spin rate of PSR 1937⫹21 suggests that it has hardly aged
at all and so must be very young. A young pulsar should also be
slowing down very rapidly. The faster it rotates, the more rapidly
it can transfer rotational energy to its surroundings and the faster
the slowdown. But PSR 1937⫹21 is actually slowing down at a
very gradual rate, millions of times more gradually than the Crab
pulsar. Such a gradual slowdown is characteristic of a pulsar hundreds of millions of years old. But if PSR 1937⫹21 is so old, how
can it be spinning so rapidly?
PSR 1937⫹21 is not the only pulsar with unusually rapid rotation. Since 1982, astronomers have discovered more than 180
very fast pulsars, which are now called millisecond pulsars. All
have periods between 1 and 10 ms, which means that these neutron stars are spinning at rates of 100 to 1000 rotations per second. (As of this writing the fastest known pulsar is PSR
J1748-2446ad, which rotates 716 times a second.)

The Origin of Millisecond Pulsars
An important clue to understanding millisecond pulsars is that the
majority are in close binary systems, with only a small separation

between the spinning neutron star and its companion. (We know
the separation must be small because the orbital periods of these
binary systems are short, between 10 and 100 days. Kepler’s third
law for binary star systems, which we described in Section 17-9,
tells us that the shorter the period, the smaller the distance between the two stars.) This fact suggests a scenario for how millisecond pulsars acquired their very rapid rotation.
Imagine a binary system consisting of a high-mass star and a
low-mass star. The high-mass star evolves more rapidly than the
low-mass star, and within a few million years becomes a Type II
supernova that creates a neutron star. Like most newborn neutron stars, it spins several times per second, and, thus, initially we
see a pulsar rather like the Crab or Vela pulsar.
TION
MA

ANI

Over the next few billion years, the pulsar slows down
as it radiates energy into space. Meanwhile, the slowly
evolving low-mass star begins to expand as it evolves
away from the main sequence to become a red giant. When the
red giant gets big enough to fill its Roche lobe, it starts to spill
gas over the inner Lagrangian point onto the neutron star. (See
Section 19-7 for a review of close binary systems.) The infalling
gas strikes the neutron star’s surface at high speed and at an angle that causes the star to spin faster. In this way, a slow, aging
pulsar is “spun up” by mass transfer from its bloated companion.
What about the few millisecond pulsars, like PSR 1937⫹21,
that are not members of close binaries? It may be that solitary
millisecond pulsars were once part of close binary systems, but
the companion stars have been eroded away by the high-energy
particles emitted by the pulsar after it was spun up. The Black
Widow pulsar—named for the species of spider whose females
kill and eat their mates—may be caught in the act of destroying
its companion in just such a process (Figure 21-11).
The Black Widow pulsar (a neutron star spinning 622 times
per second) and its companion orbit each other with a period of
9.16 hours. The orbital plane of the system is nearly edge-on to
our line of sight, so this system is an eclipsing binary (described
in Section 19-11): The companion blocks out the pulsar’s radio
signals for 45 minutes during each eclipse. Just before and after
an eclipse, however, the pulsar’s signals are delayed substantially,
as if the radio waves were being slowed as they pass through a
cloud of ionized gas surrounding the companion star. This circumstellar material is probably the star’s outer layers, dislodged
by radiation and by fast-moving particles emitted from the pulsar. In a few hundred million years or so, the companion of the
pulsar will have completely disintegrated, leaving behind only a
spun-up, solitary millisecond pulsar.
It is also possible that both stars in a close binary system
might evolve into neutron stars, forming a pair of pulsars. Several
such binary pulsars are known. Because the two pulsars are so
massive and move around each other in tight orbits, they lose energy through a process called gravitational radiation. (We will
discuss this process, which is a prediction of Einstein’s general
theory of relativity, in more detail in Chapter 22.) As a result, the
two neutron stars spiral toward each other and eventually collide.
Computer simulations of such a collision show that some of the
neutrons are ejected into space, where many of them decay into
protons and combine to form various heavy elements. In addition
to the heavy elements produced directly by supernova collisions,

slowest of all pulsars. For example, in the few thousand years
since SGR 1806-20 first formed from the core collapse of a supergiant star, its rotation period has increased from less than
0.005 s to 7.47 s. With the passage of time, a magnetar’s rotation
will continue to slow down and starquakes will eventually relieve
the crust of all of its stresses. After perhaps 10,000 years, a magnetar will cease its activity altogether. It is estimated that there
may be millions of these old, inert magnetars in our Galaxy alone.
As yet, only a handful of active magnetars are known. But
because magnetars represent such an extreme state of matter,
with magnetic effects stronger than those found anywhere else in
the universe, astronomers are studying them with great interest.
The Cosmic Connections figure depicts the key differences between magnetars and ordinary neutron stars.
Even neutron stars that lack the intense magnetic field of a
magnetar can display exotic behavior. As we will see in the remainder of this chapter, this happens when a neutron star is one
member of a binary star system in which the two stars orbit close
to each other.

constellation Centaurus (Figure 21-12). The X-ray pulses have a
regular period of 4.84 s. A few months later, similar pulses were
discovered coming from a source designated Hercules X-1, which
had a period of 1.24 s. Because the periods of these two X-ray
sources are so short, astronomers began to suspect that they were
actually observing rapidly rotating neutron stars.
It soon became clear that Centaurus X-3 and Hercules X-1
are members of binary star systems. One piece of evidence is
that every 2.087 days, Centaurus X-3 appears to turn off for almost 12 hours. Apparently, Centaurus X-3 is a neutron star in
an eclipsing binary system, and it takes nearly 12 hours for the
X-ray source to pass behind its companion star. Hercules X-1,
too, appears to turn off periodically, corresponding to a 6-hour
eclipse every 1.7 days by its visible companion, the star HZ
Herculis. Moreover, careful timing of its X-ray pulses shows a
periodic Doppler shifting every 1.7 days, which is direct evidence of orbital motion about a companion star. When the
X-ray source is approaching us, the pulses from Hercules X-1
are separated by slightly less than 1.24 seconds. When the source
is receding from us, slightly more than 1.24 seconds elapse between the pulses.
Putting all the pieces together, astronomers now realize that
pulsating X-ray sources like Centaurus X-3 and Hercules X-1 are
binary systems in which one of the stars is a neutron star. All
these binary systems have very short orbital periods, which means
that the distance between the two stars is quite small. The neutron star can therefore capture gases escaping from its ordinary
companion (Figure 21-13). More than 20 such exotic binary systems, also called X-ray binary pulsars, are known. A typical rate

21-8 Neutron stars in close binary systems
can also be pulsating X-ray sources
Millisecond pulsars are not the only result of having a neutron
star in a close binary system with an ordinary star. Even more exotic are pulsating X-ray sources, in which material from the companion star is drawn onto the magnetic poles of the neutron star,
producing intense hot spots that emit breathtaking amounts of
X rays. As the neutron star spins and the X-ray beams are directed alternately toward us and away from us, we see the X rays
flash on and off. Such pulsating X-ray sources, while similar in
many ways to ordinary pulsars, are far more luminous.

Pulsating X-ray Sources and Binary Systems
Pulsating X-ray sources were discovered in 1971 by the Uhuru spacecraft, the first to give astronomers a
comprehensive look at the X-ray sky.
(As we saw in Section 6-7, the Earth’s
atmosphere is opaque to X rays.)
The first X-ray source found to emit
pulses was Centaurus X-3, the third
X-ray source found in the southern

of mass transfer from the ordinary star to the neutron star is
roughly 10⫺9 solar masses per year.
Because of its strong gravity, a neutron star in a pulsating
X-ray source easily captures much of the gas escaping from its
companion. But like an ordinary pulsar, the neutron star is rotating rapidly and has a powerful magnetic field inclined to the axis
of rotation (recall Figure 21-3). As the gas falls toward the neutron star, its magnetic field funnels the incoming matter down
onto the star’s north and south magnetic polar regions. The neutron star’s gravity is so strong that the gas is traveling at nearly

half the speed of light by the time it crashes onto the star’s surface. This violent impact creates spots at both poles with searing
temperatures of about 108 K. Material raised to these temperatures emits abundant X rays, and because so much material is
dumped onto these hot spots the X-ray luminosity reaches roughly
1031 watts. This is much greater than the X-ray luminosity of isolated pulsars like the Crab (see Figure 21-4b) or 1E 1207.4-5209
(see Figure 21-10a), whose surface temperatures are a relatively
chilly 106 K or so. It is also nearly 105 times greater than the combined luminosity of the Sun at all wavelengths.

A Model of a Pulsating X-Ray Source Pulsating X-ray sources are
close, semidetached binary systems (compare with Figure 19-20b and

the ordinary star flows onto the neutron star and creates hot spots that

emit beams of X rays. If one of the beams is oriented so that it sweeps
over the Earth as the neutron star rotates, we see a pulse of X rays on
each sweep.

570

Chapter 21

As the neutron star rotates, the beams of X rays from its
magnetic poles sweep around the sky. If the Earth happens to be
in the path of one of the two beams, we can observe a pulsating
X-ray source. We detect a pulse once per rotation period, which
means that the neutron star in Hercules X-1 spins at the rate of
once every 1.24 seconds. If the orbital plane of the binary system
is nearly edge-on to our line of sight, as for Centaurus X-3 and
Hercules X-1, the pulsating X rays appear to turn off when the
neutron star is eclipsed by the companion star. Other pulsating
X-ray sources, such as Scorpius X-1, do not undergo this sort of
turning off. The orbital planes of these systems are oriented more
nearly face-on to our line of sight, so no eclipses occur.
The neutron stars in most pulsating X-ray sources have rotation periods (and hence pulse periods) of a few seconds. But as
time passes, the neutron star accretes more and more mass from
its companion. In the process, it will spin up and may eventually
become a millisecond pulsar (Section 21-7). In 1998 the Rossi
X-ray Timing Explorer spacecraft first observed an evolutionary
“missing link” between pulsating X-ray sources and millisecond
pulsars. This object, designated SAX J1808.4-3658, is an X-ray–
emitting millisecond pulsar in a close binary system with a pulse
period of just 2.5 ms. Apparently the pulsar has accreted a substantial amount of mass from its companion star. Like the Black
Widow pulsar (see Figure 21-11), it has also blown much of the
companion’s mass into space. Within a billion years, the companion star may disappear altogether.

21-9 Explosive thermonuclear processes on
white dwarfs and neutron stars produce

Still other exotic phenomena occur when a stellar corpse is part
of a close binary system. One example is a nova (plural novae),
in which a faint star suddenly brightens by a factor of 104 to 108
over a few days or hours, reaching a peak luminosity of about
105 L䉺. By contrast, a superova has a peak luminosity of about
109 L䉺.
A nova’s abrupt rise in brightness is followed by a gradual
decline that may stretch out over several months or more (Figure
21-14). Every year two or three novae are seen in our Galaxy,
and several dozen more are thought to take place in remote regions of the Galaxy that are obscured from our view by interstellar dust.

Novae and White Dwarfs
In the 1950s, painstaking observations of numerous novae by
Robert Kraft, Merle Walker, and their colleagues at the University of California’s Lick Observatory led to the conclusion that all
novae are members of close binary systems containing a white
dwarf. Gradual mass transfer from the ordinary companion star,
which presumably fills its Roche lobe, deposits fresh hydrogen

Because the white dwarf itself survives a nova explosion, it is

onto the white dwarf (see Figure 19-21b for a schematic diagram
of this sort of mass transfer).
Because of the white dwarf’s strong gravity, this hydrogen is
compressed into a dense layer covering the hot surface of the
white dwarf. As more gas is deposited and compressed, the temperature in the hydrogen layer increases. When the temperature
reaches about 107 K, hydrogen fusion ignites throughout the gas
layer, embroiling the white dwarf’s surface in a thermonuclear
holocaust that we see as a nova (Figure 21-15).

CAUTION! It is important to understand the similarities and
differences between novae and the thermonuclear (Type Ia) supernovae that we described in Section 20-9. Both kinds of celestial explosions are thought to occur in close binary systems
where one of the stars is a white dwarf. But, as befits their name,
supernovae are much more energetic. A Type Ia supernova
explosion radiates 1044 joules of
energy into space, while the corresponding figure for a typical nova Novae and thermonuclear
is 1037 joules. (To be fair to novae, supernovae both occur

much more mass from its companion. This added mass causes so
much compression that nuclear reactions can take place inside
the white dwarf. Eventually, these reactions blow the white
dwarf completely apart. In a nova, by contrast, nuclear reactions
occur only within the accreted material. The reaction is more se-

A surface explosion similar to a nova also occurs with neutron
stars. In 1975 it was discovered that some objects in the sky emit
sudden, powerful bursts of X rays. Figure 21-16 shows the record
of a typical burst. The source emits X rays at a constant low level
until suddenly, without warning, there is an abrupt increase in
X rays, followed by a gradual decline. An entire burst typically
lasts for only 20 s. Unlike pulsating X-ray sources, there is a fairly
long interval of hours or days between bursts. Sources that behave in this fashion are known as X-ray bursters. Several dozen
X-ray bursters have been discovered in our Galaxy.
X-ray bursters, like novae, are thought to involve close binaries whose stars are engaged in mass transfer. With a burster,
however, the stellar corpse is a neutron star rather than a white
dwarf. Gases escaping from the ordinary companion star fall onto
the neutron star. The X-ray burster’s magnetic field is probably
not strong enough to funnel the falling material toward the magnetic poles, so the gases are distributed more evenly over the surface of the neutron star. The energy released as these gases crash
down onto the neutron star’s surface produces the low-level
X rays that are continuously emitted by the burster.

Chapter 21

Most of the gas falling onto the neutron star is hydrogen,
which the star’s powerful gravity compresses against its hot surface. In fact, temperatures and pressures in this accreting layer become so high that the arriving hydrogen is converted into helium
by hydrogen fusion. As a result, the accreted gases develop a layered structure that covers the entire neutron star, with a few tens
of centimeters of hydrogen lying atop a similar thickness of helium. The structure is reminiscent of the layers within an evolved
giant star (see Figure 20-2), although the layers atop a neutron
star are much more compressed, thanks to the star’s tremendous
surface gravity.
When the helium layer is about 1 m thick, helium fusion ignites explosively and heats the neutron star’s surface to about
3 ⫻ 107 K. At this temperature the surface predominantly emits
X rays, but the emission ceases within a few seconds as the surface cools. Hence, we observe a sudden burst of X rays only a few
seconds in duration. New hydrogen then flows onto the neutron
star, and the whole process starts over. Indeed, X-ray bursters
typically emit a burst every few hours or days.
Whereas explosive hydrogen fusion on a white dwarf produces a nova, explosive helium fusion on a neutron star produces
an X-ray burster. In both cases, the process is explosive, because
the fuel is compressed so tightly against the star’s surface that it
becomes degenerate, like the star itself. As with the helium flash
inside red giants (described in Section 19-3), the ignition of a degenerate thermonuclear fuel involves a sudden thermal runaway.
This is because an increase in temperature does not produce a
corresponding increase in pressure that would otherwise relieve
compression of the gases and slow the nuclear reactions.

CAUTION! Be careful not to confuse X-ray bursters with magnetars (Section 21-6), which are also neutron stars that emit
powerful bursts of X rays. An X-ray burster is a member of a
binary system that accretes matter from its companion star, then
releases nuclear energy when the accreted matter undergoes
thermonuclear reactions. By contrast, a burst from a magnetar
is a release of magnetic energy stored in its extraordinarily powerful field; no thermonuclear reactions are involved, and no accretion from a companion star is required. There is also a huge
difference in the strength and duration of the two kinds of burst.
An X-ray burster releases about 1032 joules in a typical 20-second
burst, while a magnetar burst can release more than 1039 joules
of X-ray and gamma-ray radiation in a mere 0.2 second.
One of the great puzzles in modern astronomy has been the
nature of an even more remarkable class of events called gammaray bursters. As the name suggests, these objects emit sudden, intense bursts of high-energy gamma rays. During the short duration
of its burst, a gamma-ray burster can be 106 to 109 times brighter
than a supernova at the same distance! We will discuss these exotic objects further in Chapter 22.

21-10 Like a white dwarf, a neutron star
has an upper limit on its mass
A white dwarf will collapse if its mass is greater than the Chandrasekhar limit of 1.4 M䉺. At that point, degenerate electron
pressure cannot support the overpowering weight of the star’s

matter, which presses inward from all sides (see Section 20-4).
The mass of a neutron star also has an upper limit. However, the
pressure within a neutron star is harder to analyze, because it
comes from two sources. One is the degenerate nature of the neutrons, and the other is the strong nuclear force that acts between
the neutrons themselves.
The strong nuclear force is what holds protons and neutrons
together in atomic nuclei. Neutrons exert strong nuclear forces on
one another only when they are almost touching. This force behaves
somewhat like the force that billiard For a neutron star to
balls exert on one another when they collapse, gravity must
touch: It strongly resists further com- overwhelm both
pression. (Try squeezing two billiard degeneracy pressure and
balls together and see how much suc- the short-range
cess you have.) Hence, the strong nu- repulsion between
clear force is a major contributor to
neutrons
the star’s internal pressure. Unfortunately, there is a good deal of uncertainty about the details of this force. This translates into
uncertainties about how much weight the neutron star’s internal
pressure can support—that is, the neutron star’s maximum mass.
Theoretical estimates of this maximum mass range from 2 to 3 M䉺.
Before pulsars were discovered, most astronomers believed
all dead stars to be white dwarfs. Dying stars were thought to
somehow eject enough material so that their corpses could be below the Chandrasekhar limit. The discovery of neutron stars
proved this idea incorrect. Inspired by this lesson, astronomers
soon began wondering what might happen if a dying massive
star failed to eject enough matter to get below the upper limit for
a neutron star. For example, what might a 5-M䉺 stellar corpse
be like?
The gravity associated with a neutron star is so strong that
the escape speed from it is roughly one-half the speed of light. But
if a stellar corpse has a mass greater than 3 M䉺, so much matter
is crushed into such a small volume that the escape speed actually exceeds the speed of light. Because nothing can travel faster
than light, nothing—not even light—can leave this dead star. Its
gravity is so powerful that it leaves a hole in the fabric of space
and time. Thus, the discovery of neutron stars inspired astrophysicists to examine seriously one of the most bizarre and fantastic objects ever predicted by modern science, the black hole.
We take up its story in the next chapter.

Key Ideas
Neutron Stars: A neutron star is a dense stellar corpse consisting
primarily of closely packed degenerate neutrons.

Neutron Stars

• A neutron star typically has a diameter of about 20 km, a mass
less than 3 M䉺, a magnetic field 1012 times stronger than that of
the Sun, and a rotation period of roughly 1 second.
• A neutron star consists of a superfluid, superconducting core
surrounded by a superfluid mantle and a thin, brittle crust.

3.
4.
5.

• Intense beams of radiation emanate from regions near the north
and south magnetic poles of a neutron star. These beams are produced by streams of charged particles moving in the star’s intense
magnetic field.

6.

Pulsars: A pulsar is a source of periodic pulses of radio radiation.
These pulses are produced as beams of radio waves from a neutron star’s magnetic poles sweep past the Earth.

7.

• The pulse rate of many pulsars is slowing steadily. This reflects
the gradual slowing of the neutron star’s rotation as it radiates
energy into space. Sudden speedups of the pulse rate, called
glitches, may be caused by interactions between the neutron star’s
crust and its superfluid interior.
Magnetars: A magnetar is a pulsar with an extraordinarily strong
magnetic field. This field is produced by convection inside the
pulsar when it first forms.
• The solid crust of a magnetar is under tremendous magnetic
stress. When the surface rearranges in a starquake, the released
magnetic energy produces a powerful burst of X-rays and
gamma rays.
Neutron Stars in Close Binary Systems: If a neutron star is in a
close binary system with an ordinary star, tidal forces will draw
gas from the ordinary star onto the neutron star.
• The transfer of material onto the neutron star can make it rotate extremely rapidly, giving rise to a millisecond pulsar.
• Magnetic forces can funnel the gas onto the neutron star’s magnetic poles, producing hot spots. These hot spots then radiate intense beams of X rays. As the neutron star rotates, the X-ray
beams appear to flash on and off. Such a system is called a pulsating X-ray variable.
Novae and Bursters: Material from an ordinary star in a close binary can fall onto the surface of the companion white dwarf or
neutron star to produce a surface layer in which thermonuclear
reactions can explosively ignite.
• Explosive hydrogen fusion may occur in the surface layer of a
companion white dwarf, producing the sudden increase in luminosity that we call a nova. The peak luminosity of a nova is only
10⫺4 of that observed in a supernova.
• Explosive helium fusion may occur in the surface layer of a
companion neutron star. This produces a sudden increase in X-ray
radiation, which we call a burster.

of distance and time. It is “special” in the sense of being specialized. In particular, it does not include the effects of gravity. The
word “relativity” is used because one of the key ideas of the theory is that all measurements are made relative to an observer.
Contrary to Newton, there is no absolute framework of space and
time. In particular, the distance between two points is not an absolute, nor is the time interval between two events. Instead, the
values that you measure for these qualities depend on how you
are moving, and are relative to you. Someone moving in a different way would measure different values for these quantities.
Remarkably, Einstein’s theory is based on just two basic principles. The first is quite simple:

As seen by the outfielder, the ball is approaching
her at (30 m/s) + (10 m/s) = 40 m/s.
Ball
30 m/s

(a)
Incorrect Newtonian description:
As seen by the astronaut in the spaceship, the light is
approaching her at (3 × 108 m/s) + (1 × 108 m/s) = 4 × 108 m/s.

Your description of physical reality is the same regardless of
the constant velocity at which you move.
In other words, if you are moving in a straight line at a constant speed, you experience the same laws of physics as you would
if you were moving at any other constant speed and in any other
direction. As an example, suppose you were inside a closed railroad car moving due north in a straight line at 100 km/h. Any
measurements you make inside the car—for example, how long
your thumb is or how much time elapses between ticks of your
watch—will give exactly the same results as if the car were moving in any other direction or at any other speed, or were not
moving at all.
Einstein’s second principle is much more bizarre:
Regardless of your speed or direction of motion, you always
measure the speed of light to be the same.
To see what this implies, imagine that you are in a spaceship
moving toward a flashlight. Even if you are moving at 99%
of the speed of light, you will measure the photons from the
flashlight to be moving at the same speed (c  3  108 m/s 
3  105 km/s) as if your spaceship were motionless. This statement is in direct conflict with the Newtonian view that a stationary person and a moving person should measure different speeds
(Figure 22-1).
Speed involves both distance and time. Since speed has a very
different behavior in the special theory of relativity than in Newton’s physics, it follows that both space and time behave differently as well. Indeed, in relativity time proves to be so intimately
intertwined with the three dimensions of space that we regard
them as a single four-dimensional entity called spacetime.

Length Contraction
Einstein expressed his ideas about spacetime in a mathematical
form and used this to make a number of predictions about nature. All these predictions have been verified in innumerable experiments. One prediction is that the length you measure an object
to have depends on how that object is moving; the faster it moves,
the shorter its length along its direction of motion (Figure 22-2).
This is called length contraction. In other words, if a railroad car
moves past you at high speed, from your perspective on the

Light

Correct Einsteinian description:
As seen by the astronaut in the spaceship,
the light is approaching her at 3 × 108 m/s.
(b)

Figure 22-1
The Speed of Light Is the Same to All Observers (a) The speed you
measure for ordinary objects depends on how you are moving. Thus, the
batter sees the ball moving at 30 m/s, but the outfielder sees it moving
at 40 m/s relative to her. (b) Einstein showed that this commonsense
principle does not apply to light. No matter how fast or in what direction
the astronaut in the spaceship is moving, she and the astronaut holding
the flashlight will always measure light to have the same speed.

ground you will actually measure it to be shorter than if it were
at rest (Figure 22-2a). However, if you are on board the railroad
car and moving with it, you will measure its length to be the same
as measured on the ground when it was at rest. The word “relativity” emphasizes the importance of the relative speed between
the observer and the object being measured.
If the idea of length contraction seems outrageous, it is because this effect is noticeable only at very high speeds, comparable to that of light. But even the fastest spacecraft ever built by
humans travels at a mere 1/25,000 of the speed of light. At this
speed, a spacecraft 10 m long would be contracted in length by
only 8 nm—a distance equal to the width of a single protein molecule! For moving cars, trains, and airplanes, length contraction
is far too small to measure. As Box 22-1 describes, however, we
can easily see the effects of length contraction for subatomic particles that do indeed travel at nearly the speed of light.

Time Dilation
A second result of relativity is no less strange: A clock moving
past you runs more slowly than a clock that is at rest. Like length
contraction, this time dilation is a very small effect unless the clock
is moving at extremely high speeds (Figure 22-2b). Nonetheless,

Speed (relative to you) of the moving clock
The same train is now moving relative to you.
(a) Length contraction

Length Contraction and Time Dilation (a) The faster an object moves,
the shorter it becomes along its direction of motion. Speed has no effect
on the object’s dimensions perpendicular to the direction of motion.
(b) The faster a clock moves, the slower it runs. This graph shows how

physicists have confirmed the existence of time dilation by using
an extremely accurate atomic clock carried on a jet airliner. When
the airliner landed, they found that the on-board clock had actually ticked off slightly less time than an identical, stationary clock
on the ground. For the passengers on board the airliner during
this experiment, however, time flowed at a normal rate: The onboard clock ticked off the seconds as usual, their hearts beat at a
normal rate, and so on. You only measure a clock (or a beating
heart) to be running slow if it is moving relative to you.
Box 22-1 discusses time dilation in more detail.
The special theory of relativity predicts that the astronaut
with the flashlight in Figure 22-1b sees the astronaut flying in the
spaceship as shortened along the direction of motion and as having slowly ticking clocks. Remarkably, it also says that the flying
astronaut sees the astronaut with the flashlight (who is moving
relative to her) as being shortened and as having slowly ticking
clocks! This may seem contradictory, but it is not: Each spaceship
is moving relative to the other, and in the special theory of relativity only relative motion matters. Each astronaut’s measurements are correct relative to his or her frame of reference.

CAUTION! You may have the idea that the special theory of
relativity implies that there are no absolutes in nature and that
everything is relative. But, in fact, the special theory is based on
the principles that the laws of physics and the speed of light in
a vacuum are absolutes. Only certain quantities, such as distance and time, depend on your state of motion. You may also
have the idea that length contraction and time dilation are just
optical illusions caused by high speeds. But these effects are real.

many seconds (as measured on your clock) it takes a clock that moves
relative to you to tick off one second. The effect is pronounced only for
speeds near the speed of light c.

A moving spaceship doesn’t just look shorter or seem to be
shorter—it really is shorter. Likewise, a moving clock doesn’t
merely look like it’s ticking slowly, or seem to be ticking slowly—
it really does tick more slowly. Einstein’s theory is supported by
every experiment designed to test it. Relativity is very strange,
but it is also very real!

Mass and Energy
Einstein’s special theory of relativity predicts another famous relationship: Any object with mass (m) has energy (E) embodied in
its mass. This is expressed by the well-known formula E  mc 2,
where c is the speed of light. In thermonuclear reactions, part of
the energy embodied in the mass of atomic nuclei is converted
into other forms of energy. This released energy is what makes
the Sun and the stars shine (see Section 18-1). The sunlight we see
by day and the starlight that graces our nights are a resounding
verification of the special theory of relativity.
The special theory of relativity also explains why it is impossible for a spaceship to move at the speed of light. If it could, then
a light beam traveling in the same direction as the spaceship
would appear to the ship’s crew to be stationary. But this would
contradict the second of Einstein’s principles, which says that all
observers, including those on a spaceship, must see light traveling
at the speed of light. Therefore, it cannot be possible for a spaceship, or indeed any material object, to travel at the speed of light.
This, too, has been verified by experiments. Subatomic particles
can be made to travel at 99.99999999% of the speed of light c,
but they can never make it all the way to c.

Time Dilation and Length Contraction
he special theory of relativity describes how motion affects
measurements of time and distance. By using the two basic
T
principles of his theory—that no matter how fast you move,
the laws of physics and the speed of light are the same—
Einstein concluded that these measurements must depend on
how the person making the measurements is moving.
To describe how measurements depend on motion,
Einstein derived a series of equations named the Lorentz transformations, after the famous Dutch physicist Hendrik Antoon
Lorentz. (Lorentz was a contemporary of Einstein who developed these equations independently but did not grasp their
true meaning.) These equations tell us exactly how moving
clocks slow down and how moving objects shrink.
To appreciate the Lorentz transformations, imagine two
observers named Sergio and Majeeda. Sergio is at rest on Earth,
while Majeeda is flying past in her spaceship at a speed v.
Sergio and Majeeda both observe the same phenomenon on
Earth—say, the beating of Sergio’s heart or the ticking of
Sergio’s watch—which appears to occur over an interval of time.
According to Sergio’s clock (which is not moving relative to
the phenomenon), the phenomenon lasts for T0 seconds. This
is called the proper time of the phenomenon. But according to
Majeeda’s clock (which is moving relative to the phenomenon), the same phenomenon lasts for a different length of time,
T seconds. These two time intervals are related as follows:

EXAMPLE: Sergio heats a cup of water in a microwave oven
for 1 minute. According to Majeeda, who is flying past
Sergio at 98% of the speed of light, how long does it take to
heat the water?

Situation: The phenomenon in question is heating the water
in the microwave oven. Sergio is not moving relative to this
phenomenon (so he measures the proper time interval T0).
Majeeda is moving at speed v  0.98c relative to this
phenomenon (so she measures a different time interval T).
Our goal is to determine the value of T.

Tools: We use the Lorentz transformation for time to
calculate T.

Review: A phenomenon that lasts for T0  1 minute on

Sergio’s clock is stretched out to T  5T0  5 minutes as
measured on Majeeda’s clock moving at 98% of the speed of
light. Other phenomena are affected in the same way: As
measured by Majeeda, it takes 5 seconds for Sergio’s
wristwatch to tick off one second, and the minute hand on
Sergio’s wristwatch takes 5 hours to make a complete sweep.
The converse is also true. As measured by Sergio, the minute
hand on Majeeda’s wristwatch will take 5 hours to make a
complete sweep. This phenomenon, in which events moving
relative to an observer happen at a slower pace, is called
time dilation.
The Lorentz transformation for time is plotted in Figure
22-2b, which shows how 1 second measured on a stationary
clock (say, Sergio’s) is stretched out when measured using a
clock carried by a moving observer (such as Majeeda). For
speeds less than about half the speed of light, the mathematical factor 兹1  (v )2 is not too different from 1, and there
is little difference between the recordings of the stationary
and moving clocks. At the fastest speeds that humans have
ever traveled (en route from the Earth to the Moon), the difference between 1 and the factor 兹1  (v )2 is less than
109. So, for any speed associated with human activities, stationary and slowly moving clocks tick at essentially the same
rate. As the next example shows, however, time dilation is
important for subatomic particles that travel at speeds comparable to c.

EXAMPLE: When unstable particles called muons (pronounced
“mew-ons”) are produced in experiments on Earth, they
decay into other particles in an average time of 2.2  106 s.
Muons are also produced by fast-moving protons from
interstellar space when they collide with atoms in the Earth’s
upper atmosphere. These muons typically move at 99.9% of
the speed of light and are formed at an altitude of 10 km.
How long do such muons last before they decay?

Situation: The phenomenon in question is the life of a muon,

which lasts a time T0  2.2  106 s as measured by an
observer not moving with respect to the muon. Our goal is

Review: At this speed, the muon’s lifetime is slowed down by
time dilation by a factor of more than 22. Note that as
measured by an observer on Earth, the time that it takes a

Were there no time dilation, such a muon would decay in
just 2.2  106 s and would never reach the Earth’s surface.
But in fact, these muons are detected by experiments on the
Earth’s surface, because a muon moving at 0.999c lasts more
than 3.3  105 s. The detection at the Earth’s surface of
muons from the upper atmosphere is compelling evidence for
the reality of time dilation.
In the same terminology as “proper time,” we say that a
ruler at rest measures proper length or proper distance (L0).
According to the Lorentz transformations, distances perpendicular to the direction of motion are unaffected. However, a
ruler of proper length L0 held parallel to the direction of motion shrinks to a length L, given by

Review: We saw in the first example that according to
Sergio, Majeeda’s clocks are ticking only one-fifth as fast as
his. This example shows that he also measures Majeeda’s
1-meter ruler to be only one-fifth as long (20 cm) when held
parallel to the direction of motion. Note that the converse is
also true: If Sergio holds a 1-m ruler parallel to the direction
of relative motion, Majeeda measures it to be only 20 cm
long. This shrinkage of length is called length contraction.

EXAMPLE: Consider again the above example about muons
created 10 km above the Earth’s surface. If a muon is
traveling straight down, what is the distance to the surface as
measured by an observer riding along with the muon?

Situation: Imagine a ruler that extends straight up from the
Earth’s surface to where the muon is formed. This ruler is at
rest relative to the Earth, so its length of 10 km is the proper
length L0. Our goal is to find the length L of this ruler as
measured by the observer riding with the muon.

Chapter 22

Einstein’s special theory of relativity is a comprehensive description of the behavior of light and, by extension, of electricity and
magnetism. (Recall from Section 5-2 that light is both electric and
magnetic in nature.) Einstein’s next goal was to develop an even
more comprehensive theory that also explained gravity. This was
the general theory of relativity, which he published in 1915.

ANALOGY A useful analogy is to picture the spacetime near a
massive object such as the Sun as being curved like the surface
in Figure 22-4. Imagine a ball rolling along this surface. Far
from the “well” that represents the Sun, the surface is fairly flat
and the ball moves in a straight line. If the ball passes near the
well, however, it curves in toward it. If the ball is moving at an
appropriate speed, it might move in an orbit around the sides of
the well. The curvature of the well has the same effect on a ball
of any size, which explains why gravity produces the same acceleration on objects of different mass.

Testing the General Theory

INK 2

Einstein’s general theory of relativity and its picture of
curved spacetime have been tested in a variety of different ways. In what follows we discuss some key experimental tests of the theory.
Experimental Test 1: The grav- Careful experiments have
itational bending of light. Light rays
verified the key ideas of
naturally travel in straight lines. But
if the space through which the rays Einstein’s theory of
travel is curved, as happens when gravity
light passes near the surface of a massive object like the Sun, the paths of the rays will likewise be
curved (Figure 22-5). In other words, gravity should bend light
rays, an effect not predicted by Newtonian mechanics because
light has no mass. This prediction was first tested in 1919 during
a total solar eclipse. During totality, when the Moon blocked out

According to Newton’s theory of gravity, an apple falls to the
floor because the force of gravity pulls the apple down. But
Einstein pointed out that the apple would appear to behave in exactly the same way in space, far from the gravitational influence
of any planet or star, if the floor were to accelerate upward (in
other words, if the floor came up to meet the apple).
In Figure 22-3, two famous gentlemen are watching an apple
fall toward the floor of their closed compartments. They have no
way of telling who is at rest on the Earth and who is in the hypothetical elevator moving upward through empty space at a
constantly increasing speed. This is an example of Einstein’s
equivalence principle, which states that in a small volume of
space, the downward pull of gravity can be accurately and completely duplicated by an upward acceleration of the observer.
The equivalence principle is the key to the general theory of
relativity. It allowed Einstein to focus entirely on motion, rather
than force, in discussing gravity. A hallmark of gravity is that it
causes the same acceleration no matter the mass of the object. For
example, a baseball and a cannon ball have very different masses,
but if you drop them side by side in a vacuum, they accelerate
downward at exactly the same rate. To explain this, Einstein envisioned gravity as being caused by a curvature of space. In fact,

his general theory of relativity describes gravity entirely in terms
of the geometry of both space and time, that is, of spacetime. Far
from a source of gravity, like a planet or a star, spacetime is
“flat” and clocks tick at their normal rate. Closer to a source of
gravity, however, space is curved and clocks slow down.

Sun. Careful measurements afterward revealed that the stars were
shifted from their usual positions by an amount consistent with
Einstein’s theory.
Experimental Test 2: The precession of Mercury’s orbit. As
the planet Mercury moves along its elliptical orbit, the orbit itself
slowly changes orientation or precesses (Figure 22-6). Most of
Mercury’s precession is caused by the gravitational pull of the
other planets, as explained by Newtonian mechanics. But once
the effects of all the other planets had been accounted for, there
remained an unexplained excess rotation of Mercury’s major axis
of 43 arcsec per century. Although this discrepancy may seem
very small, it frustrated astronomers for half a century. Some astronomers searched for a missing planet even closer to the Sun

that might be tugging on Mercury; none has ever been found.
Einstein showed that at Mercury’s position close to the Sun,
the general theory of relativity predicts a small correction to
Newton’s description of gravity. This correction is just enough to
account for the excess precession.
Experimental Test 3: The gravitational slowing of time and
the gravitational red shift (Figure 22-7). In the general theory of
relativity, a massive object such as the Earth warps time as well
as space. Einstein predicted that clocks on the ground floor of a
building should tick slightly more slowly than clocks on the top
floor, which are farther from the Earth (Figure 22-7a).
A light wave can be thought of as a clock; just as a clock
makes a steady number of ticks per minute, an observer sees a

The Gravitational Deflection of Light Light rays are deflected by the

deflection is very small, only 1.75 arcsec for a light ray grazing the Sun’s

all. The deflection of starlight by the Sun was confirmed during a solar
eclipse in 1919.

The Precession of Mercury’s Orbit Mercury’s orbit changes orientation
at a rate of 574 arcsec (about one-sixth of a degree) per century.
Newtonian mechanics predicts that the gravitational influences of the
other planets should make the orientation change by only 531 arcsec per
century. Einstein was able to explain the excess 43 arcsec per century
using his general theory of relativity.

by a light source moving away from an observer. Gravitational
redshifts, by contrast, are caused by time flowing at different
rates at different locations. No motion is involved.
The American physicists Robert Pound and Glen Rebka first
measured the gravitational redshift in 1960 using gamma rays
fired between the top and bottom of a shaft 20 meters tall. Because the Earth’s gravity is relatively weak, the redshift that they
measured was very small (/  2.5  1015) but was in complete agreement with Einstein’s prediction.
Much larger shifts are seen in the spectra of white dwarfs,

dwarf’s intense surface gravity. As an example, the gravitational

Experimental Test 4: Gravitational waves. Electric

similar way, the general theory of relativity predicts that oscillating massive objects should produce gravitational radiation, or
gravitational waves. (Newton’s theory of gravity makes no such
prediction.)

INK 2

Gravitational radiation is exceedingly difficult to detect, because it is by nature much weaker than electromagnetic radiation. Although physicists have built a
number of sensitive “antennas” for gravitational radiation, no
confirmed detections have been made as of this writing (2007).
But compelling indirect evidence for the existence of gravitational
radiation has come from a binary system of two neutron stars.
Russell Hulse and Joseph Taylor at the University of Massachusetts discovered that these stars are slowly spiraling toward each
other and losing energy in the process (see Section 21-7). The rate
at which they lose energy is just what would be expected if the
two neutron stars are emitting gravitational radiation as predicted
by Einstein. Hulse and Taylor shared the 1993 Nobel Prize in
physics for their discovery.

prediction. It now stands as our most accurate and complete

of a building, an observer at the top floor will measure a “slowticking” light wave with a lower frequency, and thus a longer
wavelength, than will an observer on the ground floor (Figure

the top floor has less energy than when it left the ground floor.

Section 5-5.) These effects, which have no counterpart in Newton’s theory of gravity, are called the gravitational redshift.

description of gravity. Einstein demonstrated that Newtonian mechanics is accurate only when applied to low speeds and weak
gravity. If extremely high speeds or powerful gravity are involved,
only a calculation using relativity will give correct answers.

None of the star’s mass is lost when it collapses to form a black
hole, however. This mass gives the spacetime around the black
hole its strong curvature. Thanks to this curvature, the black hole’s
gravitational influence can still be felt by other objects.

Relativity and Black Holes
Perhaps the most dramatic prediction of the general theory of relativity concerns what happens when a large amount of matter is
concentrated in a small volume. We have seen that if a dying star
is not too massive, it ends up as a white dwarf star. If the dying
star is more massive than the Chandrasekhar limit of about
1.4 M䉺, it cannot exist as a stable white dwarf star and, instead,
shrinks down to form a neutron star. But if the dying star has
more mass than the maximum permissible for a neutron star,
about 2 to 3 M䉺, not even the internal pressure of neutrons can
hold the star up against its own gravity, and the star contracts
rapidly.
As the star’s matter becomes compressed to enormous densities, the strength of gravity at the surface of this rapidly shrinking sphere also increases dramatically. According to the general
theory of relativity, the space immediately surrounding the star
becomes so highly curved that it closes on itself (Figure 22-8).
Photons flying outward at an angle from the star’s surface arc
back inward, while photons that fly straight outward undergo
such a strong gravitational redshift that they lose all their energy
and cease to exist.
Ordinary matter can never travel as fast as light. Hence, if
light cannot escape from the collapsing star, neither can anything
else. An object from which neither matter nor electromagnetic radiation can escape is called a black hole. In a sense, a hole is
punched in the fabric of the universe, and the dying star disappears into this cavity (Figure 22-9).

curves the spacetime

3. Objects that venture too
close to the black hole cannot

close to the black hole, the
curvature forms a “well”
that is infinitely deep.

spacetime is distorted by a black hole’s mass. As in Figure 22-4,
spacetime is represented as a two-dimensional surface. Unlike the
situation in Figure 22-4, a black hole’s gravitational “well” is infinitely deep.

586

Chapter 22

CAUTION! Some low-quality science-fiction movies and books
suggest that black holes are evil things that go around gobbling
up everything in the universe. Not so! The bizarre effects created by highly warped spacetime are limited to a region quite
near the hole. For example, the effects of the general theory of
relativity predominate only within 1000 km of a 10-M䉺 black
hole. Beyond 1000 km, gravity is weak enough that Newtonian
physics can adequately describe everything. If our own Sun
somehow turned into a black hole (an event that, happily, seems
to be quite impossible), the orbits of the planets would hardly
be affected at all.
Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of black holes is that
they really exist! As we will see, astronomers have located a number of black holes with masses a few times that of the Sun. What
is truly amazing is that they have also discovered many truly immense black holes containing millions or billions of solar masses.
These discoveries are a resounding confirmation of the ideas of
the general theory of relativity. In the next three sections we will
see how astronomers hunt down black holes in space.

22-3 Certain binary star systems probably
contain black holes
Finding black holes is a difficult business. Because light cannot escape from inside the black hole, you cannot observe one directly
in the same way that you can observe a star or a planet. The best
you can hope for is to detect the effects of a black hole’s powerful gravity.
Close binary star systems offer one way to find stellar-mass
black holes (that is, ones with masses comparable to those of ordinary stars). Imagine that one of the stars in a binary system
evolves into a black hole. If the black
hole orbits close enough to the other,
ordinary star in the system, tidal One key to detecting
forces can draw matter from the or- black holes is to search
dinary star onto the black hole. If for the radiation emitted

the presence of the black hole.

source was at the same location in the sky as the star HDE 226868
(Figure 22-10). Spectroscopic observations revealed that
HDE 226868 is a B0 supergiant with a surface temperature of
about 31,000 K. Such stars do not emit significant amounts of
X rays, so HDE 226868 alone cannot be the X-ray source Cygnus
X-1. Because binary stars are very common, astronomers began
to suspect that the visible star and the X-ray source are in orbit
about each other.
Further spectroscopic observations soon showed that the lines
in the spectrum of HDE 226868 shift back and forth with a period of 5.6 days. This behavior is characteristic of a single-line
spectroscopic binary (see Section 17-10); the companion of
HDE 226868 is too dim to produce its own set of spectral lines.
The clear implication is that HDE 226868 and Cygnus X-1 are
the two components of a binary star system.
From what we know about the masses of other supergiant
stars, HDE 226868 is estimated to have a mass of roughly
30 M䉺. As a result, the unseen member of the binary system must
have a mass of about 7 M䉺 or more. Otherwise, it would not exert enough gravitational pull to make the B0 star wobble by the
amount deduced from the periodic Doppler shifting of its spectral
lines. Because the unseen companion does not emit visible light,
it cannot be an ordinary star. Furthermore, because 7 solar masses
is too large for either a white dwarf or a neutron star, Cygnus
X-1 is likely to be a black hole.
The case for Cygnus X-1 being a black hole is not airtight.
HDE 226868 might have a low mass for its spectral type, which
would imply a somewhat lower mass for Cygnus X-1. In addition, uncertainties in the distance to the binary system could

The Strange Case of Cygnus X-1
The first sign of such emissions from a binary system with a black
hole came shortly after the launch of the Uhuru X-ray–detecting
satellite in 1971. Astronomers became intrigued with an X-ray
source designated Cygnus X-1. This source is quite unlike pulsating X-ray sources, which emit regular bursts of X rays every few
seconds (see Section 21-8). Instead, the X-ray emissions from
Cygnus X-1 are highly variable and irregular; they flicker on time
scales as short as one-hundredth of a second. One of the fundamental concepts in physics is that nothing can travel faster than
the speed of light (recall Section 22-1). Because of this limitation,
an object cannot flicker faster than the time required for light to
travel across the object. Because light travels 3000 km in a hundredth of a second, Cygnus X-1 can be no more than 3000 km
across, or about a quarter the size of the Earth.
Cygnus X-1 occasionally emits bursts of radio radiation, and
in 1971 radio astronomers used these bursts to show that the

Other Black Hole Candidates
Astronomers have found more than 20 other black hole candidates like Cygnus X-1. All are compact X-ray sources orbiting ordinary stars in a spectroscopic binary system. One of the best
candidates is V404 Cygni in the constellation Cygnus. Doppler
shift measurements reveal that as the visible star moves around
its 6.47-day orbit, its radial velocity (see Section 17-10) varies by
more than 400 km/s. These data give a firm lower limit of
6.26 M䉺 for the mass of the unseen companion. It is probably
impossible for a neutron star to be more massive than 3 M䉺, so
V404 Cygni must almost certainly be a black hole.

Another particularly convincing case is the flickering X-ray
source A0620-00 in the constellation Monoceros. (The A refers
to the British satellite Ariel 5, which discovered the source; the
numbers denote its position in the sky.) The visible companion to
A0620-00 is an orange K5 main-sequence star called V616 Monocerotis, which orbits the X-ray source every 7.75 hours. Because
this star is relatively faint, it is possible to observe the shifting
spectral lines from both the visible companion and the X-ray
source as they orbit each other. With this more complete information about the orbits, astronomers have determined the mass
of A0620-00 to be more than 3.2 M䉺, and more probably about
9 M䉺.

Astronomers have seen jets of hot, glowing material
extending several light-years from some black hole candidates. The ejected material emerges from the vicinity
of the black hole at speeds approaching the speed of light. It is
thought that these jets are formed by strong electric and magnetic
fields in the material around a rotating black hole, much as occurs for rotating protostars (see Figure 18-16) and for rotating
neutron stars (see Figure 21-7). Figure 22-12 is an artist’s impression of the immediate vicinity of such a rotating black hole.
(We will discuss the curious features of rotating black holes in
Section 22-7.)
If there really are black holes in close binary systems, how
did they get there? One possibility is that one member of the binary explodes as a Type II supernova, leaving a burned-out core
whose mass exceeds 3 M䉺. This core undergoes gravitational collapse to form a black hole.

further reduce estimates of the mass of Cygnus X-1. If all these
uncertainties combined in just the right way, the estimated mass
of Cygnus X-1 could be pushed down to about 3 M䉺. Thus, there
is a slim chance that Cygnus X-1 might contain the most massive
possible neutron star rather than a black hole.
If Cygnus X-1 does contain a black hole, the X rays do not
come from the black hole itself. Gas captured from HDE 226868
goes into orbit about the hole, forming an accretion disk about
4 million kilometers in diameter (Figure 22-11). As material in the
disk gradually spirals in toward the hole, friction heats the gas to
temperatures approaching 2  106 K. In the final 200 kilometers
above the hole, these extremely hot gases emit the X rays that our
satellites detect. Presumably the X-ray flickering is caused by
small hot spots on the rapidly rotating inner edge of the accretion
disk. In this way, the black hole’s existence is announced by
doomed gases just before they plunge to oblivion.

and its immediate surroundings might appear as shown in Figure 22-12.

from gamma-ray bursters, mysteri- galaxies
ous objects that emit the most powerful bursts of high-energy radiation
ever measured. To understand the connection between these objects and black holes, we begin by looking at how gamma-ray
bursters were discovered and how astronomers struggled to determine their true nature.

Figure 22-12
The Environment of an Accreting Black Hole If a black hole is
rotating, it can generate strong electric and magnetic fields in its
immediate vicinity. These fields draw material from the accretion disk
around the black hole and accelerate it into oppositely directed jets along
the black hole’s rotation axis. This illustration also shows other features
of the material surrounding such a black hole. (CXC/M. Weiss)

A white dwarf or a neutron star in a binary system could also
become a black hole if it accretes enough matter from its companion star. This transformation can occur when the companion
star becomes a red giant and dumps a significant part of its mass
over its Roche lobe (see Figure 19-21b).
Finally, another possibility is two dead stars coalescing to
form a black hole. For example, imagine two neutron stars orbiting each other, like the binary systems discussed in Section 21-7
and Section 22-2. Because the two stars emit gravitational radiation, they gradually spiral in toward each other and eventually
merge. If their total mass exceeds 2 to 3 M䉺, the entire system
may become a black hole.

As we have seen, bursts of X rays from binary systems
such as Cygnus X-1 lead us to the remarkable conclusion that black holes are real, and that certain stars can

Gamma-ray bursters were discovered in the late 1960s by the orbiting Vela satellites, whose detectors noticed flashes of gamma
rays coming from random parts of the sky at random intervals.
This discovery was an unexpected consequence of the Cold War.
The Vela satellites were originally placed in orbit by the United
States to look for high-energy photons coming from above-ground
tests of nuclear weapons by the Soviet Union, tests that had been
banned by treaty since 1963. (No such tests were ever detected.)
More than 3000 of these cosmic flashes have been detected since
1967. With a new generation of gamma-ray telescopes currently
in orbit (see Section 6-7), new gamma-ray bursters are being
found at a rate of about one per day.
Gamma-ray bursters fall into two types. Long-duration
gamma-ray bursters, which are more common, last from about
2 to about 1000 seconds before fading to invisibility. The less
common short-duration gamma-ray bursters last from a few hundredths of a second to about 2 seconds, and tend to emit photons
of shorter wavelength and hence higher energy. Unlike X-ray
bursters (see Section 21-9), gamma-ray bursters of both types appear to emit only one burst in their entire history.
What are gamma-ray bursters, and how far away are they?
These questions plagued astronomers for almost 30 years. One
important clue is that gamma-ray bursters are seen with roughly
equal probability in all parts of the sky, as Figure 22-13a shows.
This suggests that they are not in the disk of our Galaxy, because
then most gamma-ray bursters would be found in the plane of the
Milky Way (Figure 22-13b). One idea was that gamma-ray
bursters are relatively close to us and lie in a spherical halo surrounding the Milky Way. Alternatively, gamma-ray bursters could
be strewn across space like galaxies, with some of them billions
of light-years away.

Long-Duration Gamma-Ray Bursters and Supernovae
For many years there was no convincing way to decide between
these competing models. This state of affairs changed dramatically in 1997, thanks to the Italian-Dutch BeppoSAX satellite.
Unlike previous gamma-ray satellites, which could determine the
position of a burst only to within a few degrees, BeppoSAX could
pin down its position to within an arcminute. This made it far
easier for astronomers using optical telescopes to search for a
counterpart to the burster. Just 21 hours after BeppoSAX observed a long-duration gamma-ray burster on February 28, 1997,
astronomers led by Jan van Paradis of the University of Amsterdam located a visible-light afterglow of the burst. Since then,

astronomers using large visible-light and infrared telescopes have
detected the afterglow of many gamma-ray bursters, and have
found that they occur within galaxies (Figure 22-14). As of this
writing (2007), the most distant gamma-ray burster yet seen lies
within a galaxy some 13 billion (1.3  1010) light-years away. (In
Chapter 24 we will see how astronomers determine the distances
to remote galaxies.) To be seen at such immense distances a
gamma-ray burster must release a truly stupendous amount of energy in the form of radiation.

The relationship between gamma-ray bursters and
galaxies strongly suggests that a burster is a cataclysmic
event involving one of a galaxy’s stars. Observations of
a relatively bright (and hence relatively close) long-duration
gamma-ray burster have confirmed this idea. On March 29, 2003,
the orbiting gamma-ray telescope HETE-2 (short for High Energy
Transient Explorer) detected this burster—denoted GRB 030329
for the date it was observed—in the constellation Leo. (GRB 030329
was so intense that its high-energy photons temporarily ionized
part of the Earth’s atmosphere—the only event of its kind ever
caused by an object beyond our own Galaxy.) Within 90 minutes
a visible-light afterglow of GRB 030329 was found by astronomers in Australia and Japan. The afterglow was bright
enough that astronomers in the United States and Chile were able
to measure its detailed spectrum, which turned out to be that of
a Type Ic supernova at a distance of some 2.65 billion (2.65 
109) light-years. We saw in Section 20-9 that a Type Ic supernova
results when a massive star undergoes core collapse after having
first shed the hydrogen and helium from its outer layers (see
Figure 20-20c). Subsequent observations with the Hubble Space
Telescope revealed an expanding shell of gas at the position of the
gamma-ray burster. This shell is just what we would expect from
a supernova explosion. Another long-duration gamma-ray burster
with an associated Type Ic supernova was seen in 2006.

A long-duration gamma-ray burster cannot simply be an ordinary
Type Ic core-collapse supernova, however. Such supernovae release about 1046 joules of energy, of which only about 0.03% is

released as electromagnetic radiation. (Most of the remaining energy goes into neutrinos, while some goes into accelerating the debris that expands away from the supernova.) This radiation
streams outward from the supernova in all directions equally, like
light from the Sun. If we assume that a gamma-ray burster also
emits light equally in all directions, the inverse-square law that relates brightness, luminosity, and distance (see Section 17-2) tells
us that the most energetic bursters would have to emit about
3  1047 joules of radiation in less than a minute. It would take
100,000 supernovae going off simultaneously to release this much
radiation!
This dilemma can be resolved if we imagine a type of supernova that emits most of its radiation in narrow beams. If such a
beam happened to be aimed toward Earth, we would detect a far
more intense burst of radiation than we would from an ordinary
supernova.

ANALOGY An ordinary flashlight is an example of beamed radiation. The lightbulb in a flashlight is very small and produces
only a weak light if you remove it from the flashlight housing.
But the flashlight’s curved mirror channels the bulb’s light into
a narrow beam. Thus, a flashlight produces an intense beam of
light with only a small input of energy from the batteries.

Collapsars and the Birth of a Black Hole
One theoretical model that would produce beamed radiation invokes a special type of supernova called a collapsar (also called a
hypernova). These objects are thought to result from progenitor
stars that are very massive (more than about 30 M䉺), have lost
their outer layers of hydrogen and helium, and are rotating rapidly. The core of such a star is too massive to be a white dwarf

or a neutron star, so when thermonuclear reactions cease the core
will become a black hole. Figure 22-15 depicts what happens
when thermonuclear reactions cease in the core of such a star.
The black hole forms before the material outside the core has a
chance to contract very much (Figure 22-15a). As a result, the
black hole quickly forms an accretion disk from the surrounding
stellar material as shown in Figure 22-15b. This process is aided
because the progenitor star was rotating rapidly, which makes it
easier for the infalling material to form a rotating disk around
the black hole. Some of the infalling material does not fall into the
black hole, but is ejected in powerful, back-to-back jets along
the rotation axis of the accretion disk. (Much the same mechanism acts in close binary star systems in which one member is a
black hole, as we described in Section 22-3.)
The jets are so energetic that they reach and break through
the surface of the star within 5 to 10 seconds after being formed,
as Figure 22-15c shows. (It helps that the star has already lost
much of its outer layers. This makes it easier for the jets to break
through what remains of the star.) As they travel outward, the
jets produce powerful shock waves that blow the star to pieces.
If one of the jets from a collapsar happens to be aimed toward Earth, we see an intense burst of gamma rays. These are
produced as the relativistic particles in the jet slow down and convert their kinetic energy (energy of motion) into radiation. The
burst is short-lived because the jets have only a brief existence: It
takes the black hole only about 20 seconds to accrete the entire
inner core of the star, after which there is no longer an accretion
disk to produce the jets. We do not see a burster if the jets are
aimed away from Earth. Hence, for each gamma-ray burster that
we observe, there may be hundreds or thousands of collapsars
that go undetected.

Two oppositely-directed jets of fast-moving
particles emerge along the star’s rotation axis.

The fast-moving jets produce
intense beams of gamma rays.

The newest tool in the search for answers about gammaray bursters is a NASA satellite called Swift, which was
launched in 2004. In addition to sensitive gamma-ray
detectors to identify bursters, Swift carries telescopes that are sensitive to X rays, ultraviolet light, and visible light. Thus, instead
of having to wait for ground-based telescopes to make follow-up
observations of gamma-ray bursters, Swift can make these observations itself as swiftly as possible (hence the spacecraft’s name).
Observations from Swift may help us better understand the nature of long-duration bursters, and provide important clues about
the still enigmatic short-duration bursters.

22-5 Supermassive black holes exist
at the centers of most galaxies
Stellar evolution makes it possible to form black holes with masses
several times that of the Sun. But calculations suggest other ways
to form black holes that are either extremely large or extraordinarily small.

Supermassive Black Holes
As we will discuss in Chapter 26, galaxies formed in the early universe by the coalescence of gas clouds. During this formation
process, some of a galaxy’s gas could have plunged straight toward the center of the galaxy, where it collected and compressed
together under its own gravity. If this central clump became sufficiently dense, it could have formed a black hole. Typical galaxies have masses of 1011 M䉺, so even a tiny percentage of the

galaxy’s gas collected at its center
would give rise to a supermassive
black hole with a truly stupendous
mass.

Since the 1970s, astronomers have found evidence suggesting the existence of supermassive black holes in
other galaxies. With the advent of a new generation of
optical telescopes in the 1990s, it became possible to see the environments of these suspected black holes with unprecedented detail (Figure 22-16). Figure 22-16a shows radio emissions from
two jets that extend some 15,000 pc (50,000 ly) from the center
of the galaxy NGC 4261. These resemble an immensely magnified version of the jets seen emerging from some stellar-mass
black holes (see Section 22-3). The highly magnified Hubble Space
Telescope image in Figure 22-16b shows a disk some 250 pc
(800 ly) in diameter at the very center of this galaxy. The jets are
perpendicular to the plane of the disk, just as in Figure 22-12.
By measuring the Doppler shifts of light coming from the two
sides of the disk, astronomers found that the disk material was
orbiting around the bright object at the center of the disk at
speeds of hundreds of kilometers per second. (By comparison, the
Earth orbits the Sun at 30 km/s.) Given the size of the material’s
orbit, and using Newton’s form of Kepler’s third law (see Section
4-7 and Box 4-4), they were able to calculate the mass of the
central bright object. The answer is an amazing 1.2 billion
(1.2  109) solar masses! What is more, the observations show
that this object can be no larger than our solar system. The only
possible explanation is that the object at the center of NGC 4261
is a black hole.
Dozens of other black holes in the centers of galaxies have
been identified by their gravitational effect on surrounding gas
and dust. Surveys of galaxies have shown that supermassive black
holes are not at all unusual; most large galaxies appear to have
them at their centers. As we will see in the next chapter, a black
hole with several million solar masses lies at the center of our own
Milky Way Galaxy, some 8000 pc (26,000 ly) from Earth.

The collapsar model cannot explain short-duration gammaray bursters, whose lifetimes of less than 2 seconds are far shorter
than those of a collapsar’s jets. A number of models for shortduration bursters have been proposed, such as the energy released
by the merger of two neutron stars or a particularly intense magnetar burst (see Section 21-6).

Black holes seem to fall into two very different groups depending
on their size. Supermassive black holes have masses from 106 to
109 M䉺, while stellar-mass black holes like those discussed in

He suggested that during the Big Bang some 13.7 billion years
ago, local pockets of the universe could have been dense enough
and under sufficient pressure to form small black holes. According to his theory, these primordial black holes could have had
masses as large as the Earth or as small as 5  108 kg, about
1/40 the mass of a single raindrop. To date, however, no evidence
has been found for the existence of primordial black holes
in nature.

The new discovery was a fluctuating X-ray source located some 200 pc (600 ly) from the center of the
galaxy M82 (Figure 22-17). Images do not reveal material orbiting around this source, so we cannot determine the
source’s mass using Newton’s form of Kepler’s third law. But by
relating the source’s X-ray luminosity to the rate at which matter
would have to fall onto the source to produce that luminosity, it
can be shown that the source must have a mass of at least 500 M䉺
or so. The rapid fluctuations of the source show that it has a very
small diameter, which suggests that it is a black hole (see Section
22-3). Hence, the source in M82 may be an intermediate-mass black
hole (also called a mid-mass black hole) Additional intermediatemass black hole candidates have been found in other galaxies.
Such black holes might have formed by the coalescence of many
normal stars or by the direct merger of stellar-mass black holes.
During the early 1970s, Stephen Hawking of Cambridge University proposed the existence of yet another type of black hole.

a “center” and a “surface”
Understanding in detail how black holes form is a challenging
task. But once a black hole forms, it has a remarkably simple
structure.
Surrounding a black hole, where the escape speed from the
hole just equals the speed of light, is the event horizon. You can
think of this sphere as the “surface” of the black hole, although
the black hole’s mass all lies well inside this “surface.” Once a
massive dying star collapses to within its event horizon, it disappears permanently from the universe. The term “event horizon”
is quite appropriate, because this surface is like a horizon beyond
which we cannot see any events.

Once a nonrotating star has contracted inside its event horizon,
nothing can prevent its complete collapse. The star’s entire mass is All of the mass of a
crushed to zero volume—and hence nonrotating black hole is
infinite density—at a single point,
concentrated in a point
known as the singularity, at the center of the black hole. We now can of zero size and
see that the structure of a nonrotat- infinitely high density
ing black hole is quite simple. As
drawn in Figure 22-18, it has only two parts: a singularity at the
center surrounded by a spherical event horizon.

Review: The Schwarzschild radius is directly proportional to
the mass of the black hole. Thus, a black hole with 10 times
the mass (100 M䉺) would have a Schwarzschild radius
10 times larger (RSch  10  30 km  300 km); a black hole
with half the mass (5 M䉺) would have half as large a
Schwarzschild radius (RSch  1/2  30 km  15 km), and
so on.

To understand why the complete collapse of such a doomed
star is inevitable, think about your own life on the Earth, far from
any black holes. You have the freedom to move as you wish
through the three dimensions of space: up and down, left and
right, or forward and back. But you do not have the freedom to
move at will through the dimension of time. Whether we like it
or not, we are all carried inexorably from the cradle to the grave.
Inside a black hole, gravity distorts the structure of spacetime
so severely that the directions of space and time become interchanged. In a sense, inside a black hole you acquire a limited ability to affect the passage of time. This seeming gain does you no
good, however, because you lose a corresponding amount of freedom to move through space. Whether you like it or not, you will
be dragged inexorably from the event horizon toward the singularity. Just as no force in the universe can prevent the forward
march of time from past to future outside a black hole, no force
in the universe can prevent the inward march of space from event
horizon to singularity inside a black hole. Once an object dropped
into a black hole crosses the event horizon, it is gone forever, like
an object dropped into a bottomless pit.
The same is true for a light beam aimed at the black hole. Because all this light will be absorbed and none reflected back, a

Figure 22-18
The Structure of a Nonrotating (Schwarzschild) Black Hole
A nonrotating black hole has only two parts: a singularity, where all of the
mass is located, and a surrounding event horizon. The distance from the
singularity to the event horizon is called the Schwarzschild radius (RSch).
The event horizon is a one-way surface: Things can fall in, but nothing
can get out.

In addition to shielding us from singularities, the event horizon
prevents us from ever knowing much
about anything that falls into a black
hole. A black hole is, in fact, an “in- When an object falls into
formation sink.” Many properties of a black hole, all
matter falling into a black hole, such information about that
as its chemical composition, texture, object disappears except
color, shape, and size, simply vanish its mass, electric charge,
as soon as the matter crosses the
and angular momentum
event horizon.
Because this information has completely vanished, it cannot
affect the structure or properties of the hole. For example, consider two hypothetical black holes, one made from the gravitational collapse of 10 M䉺 of iron and the other made from the
gravitational collapse of 10 M䉺 of peanut butter. Obviously,
quite different substances went into the creation of the two holes.
Once the event horizons of these two black holes have formed,
however, both the iron and the peanut butter will have permanently disappeared from the universe. As seen from the outside,
the two holes are absolutely identical, making it impossible for us
to tell which ate the peanut butter and which ate the iron. A black
hole is thus unaffected by the information it destroys.

The Three Properties of a Black Hole
black hole is totally and utterly black. (By contrast, even the
blackest object on Earth reflects some light when you shine a
flashlight on it. A black hole would reflect none.)
At a black hole’s singularity, the strength of gravity is infinite, so the curvature of spacetime there is infinite. Space and time
at the singularity are thus all jumbled up. They do not exist as
separate, distinctive entities.
This confusion of space and time has profound implications
for what goes on inside a black hole. All the laws of physics require a clear, distinct background of space and time. Without this
identifiable background, we cannot speak rationally about the
arrangement of objects in space or the ordering of events in time.
Because space and time are all jumbled up at the center of a black
hole, the singularity there does not obey the laws of physics. The
singularity behaves in a random, capricious fashion, totally devoid of rhyme or reason.
Fortunately, we are shielded from the singularity by the event
horizon. In other words, although random things do happen at
the singularity, none of their effects manages to escape beyond the
event horizon. Consequently, the outside universe remains understandable and predictable.
The chaotic, random behavior of the singularity has been so
disturbing to physicists that in 1969 the British mathematician
Roger Penrose and his colleagues proposed the law of cosmic censorship: “Thou shalt not have naked singularities.” In other
words, every singularity must be completely surrounded by an
event horizon, because an exposed singularity could affect the
universe in an unpredictable and random way.
Although black holes are really very simple objects, there are
some common misconceptions about their nature. The Cosmic
Connections figure exposes two of these misconceptions.

Because a black hole is indeed an information sink, it is reasonable to wonder whether we can determine anything at all about
a black hole. What properties do characterize a black hole?
First, we can measure the mass of a black hole. One way to
do this would be by placing a satellite into orbit around the hole.
After measuring the size and period of the satellite’s orbit, we
could use Newton’s form of Kepler’s third law (recall Section 4-7
and Box 4-4) to determine the mass of the black hole. This is equal
to the total mass of all the material that has gone into the hole.
Second, we can also measure the total electric charge possessed by a black hole. Like gravity, the electric force acts over
long distances—it is a long-range interaction that is felt in the
space around the hole. Appropriate equipment on a space probe
passing near the hole could measure the strength of the electric
force, and the electric charge could thus be determined.
In actuality, we would not expect a black hole to possess
much, if any, electric charge. For example, if a hole did happen
to start off with a sizable positive charge, it would vigorously attract vast numbers of negatively charged electrons from the interstellar medium, which would soon neutralize the hole’s charge.
For this reason, astronomers usually neglect electric charge when
discussing real black holes.
Although a black hole might theoretically have a tiny electric
charge, it can have no magnetic field of its own whatsoever. (We
discussed in Section 22-3 how magnetic fields are involved in producing jets from black holes. However, these fields are associated
with the accretion disk around the black hole, not the black hole
itself.)
When a black hole is created, however, the collapsing star
from which it forms may possess an appreciable magnetic field.
The star must therefore radiate this magnetic field away before it

Black holes are such intriguing objects that a folklore has developed
about them. As often is the case with folklore, myth and reality can
become confused. These illustrations depict two misconceptions or
“urban legends” about black holes.

Urban Legend #1:
When a star becomes a black hole, its gravitational pull becomes stronger.
Reality: At great distances from a black hole, the gravitational force that it exerts is exactly the same as that exerted by an
ordinary star of the same mass. The truly stupendous gravitational effects of a black hole appear only if you venture close to
the black hole’s event horizon.
Consider gravitational forces on a 60-kg person (not shown to scale). The
gravitational force of the Earth on this person when standing on our planet’s
surface — that is, this person’s weight on Earth — is 590 newtons (132 pounds).

Urban Legend #2:
The larger a black hole, the more powerful the gravity near its Schwarzschild radius.
Reality: If you increase the mass of a black hole, its Schwarzschild radius increases by the same factor. Newton’s law of
universal gravitation, F  Gm1m2Ir2, tells us that the force that an object of mass m1 exerts on a second object of mass m2 is
directly proportional to mass m1 but inversely proportional to the square of the distance r between the two objects. Hence
the force that a black hole exerts on an object a given distance outside its Schwarzschild actually decreases as the black
hole’s mass and Schwarzschild radius increase.

can settle down inside its event horizon. Theory predicts that the
star does this by emitting electromagnetic and gravitational waves.
As we saw in Section 22-2, gravitational waves are ripples in the
overall geometry of space. Various experiments soon to be in operation may detect bursts of gravitational radiation emitted by
massive stars as they collapse to form black holes.
Third, we can detect the effects of a black hole’s rotation,
that is, measure its angular momentum. An object’s angular momentum is related to how fast it rotates and how the object’s mass
is distributed over its volume. As a dead star collapses into a
black hole, its rotation naturally speeds up as its mass moves toward the center, just as a figure skater rotates faster when she
pulls her arms and legs in. This same effect explains the rotation
of the solar nebula (see Section 8-4), as well as why neutron stars
spin so fast (see Section 21-3). We expect a black hole that forms
from a rotating star to be spinning very rapidly.

Event horizon

Singularity

Rotating Black Holes
When the matter that collapses to form a black hole is rotating,
that matter does not compress to a point. Instead, it collapses into
a ring-shaped singularity located between the center of the hole
and the event horizon (Figure 22-19). The structure of such rotating black holes was first worked out in 1963 by the New
Zealand mathematician Roy Kerr. Most rotating black holes
should be spinning thousands of times per second, even faster
than the most rapid pulsars (see Section 21-7).

If a rotating black hole is surrounded by an accretion
disk with a magnetic field, it may be possible for the
field to steal some of the rotational energy and angular momentum from the black hole and transfer it to the disk. The
magnetic field acts as a “brake” that retards the black hole’s rotation and makes the disk’s rotation speed up. (On Earth, magnetic braking is used to slow locomotives, amusement park rides,
and hybrid automobiles to a smooth stop without generating excess heat.) Figure 22-20 shows an arching magnetic field that connects an accretion disk with a rotating black hole in just this way.
This process may be taking place with the supermassive black
hole at the center of the galaxy MCG–6-15-30. Observations with
the XMM-Newton telescope (see Section 6-7) indicate that unusually intense X-rays are coming from the accretion disk around
this black hole. The suspicion is that the energy to power this radiation may be extracted from the black hole’s rotation. (This
transfer of energy and angular momentum can also go the other
way. The image that opens this chapter depicts a system in which
magnetic fields are thought to transfer angular momentum to a
black hole from its accretion disk. Robbing the accretion disk
of its rotation makes it easier for its material to fall into the
black hole.)
LINK 22

WEB

.13

Even a rotating black hole without an accretion disk
can transfer energy to other objects. This is possible
according to Einstein’s general theory of relativity,
which makes the startling prediction that a rotating body drags
spacetime around it. (Very precise spacecraft measurements indicate that the rotating Earth drags spacetime in just this way.)
Surrounding the event horizon of every rotating black hole is a

Ergoregion

Figure 22-19
The Structure of a Rotating (Kerr) Black Hole The singularity of a
rotating black hole is an infinitely thin ring centered on the geometrical
center of the hole. (It appears as an arc in this cutaway diagram.) Outside
the spherical event horizon is the doughnut-shaped ergoregion, where the
dragging of spacetime around the hole is so severe that nothing can
remain at rest. The tan-colored surface marks the outer boundary of the
ergoregion.

region where this dragging of space and time is so severe that it
is impossible to stay in the same place. No matter what you do,
you get pulled around the hole, along with the rotating geometry of space and time. This region, where it is impossible to be
at rest, is called the ergoregion (see Figure 22-19).
To measure a black hole’s angular momentum, we could hypothetically place two satellites in orbit about the hole. Suppose
that one satellite circles the hole in the same direction the hole
rotates and the other in the opposite direction. One satellite is
thus carried along by the geometry of space and time, but the
other is constantly fighting its way “upstream.” The two satellites will thus have different orbital periods. By comparing these
two periods, astronomers can deduce the total angular momentum of the hole.
Because the ergoregion is outside the event horizon, this
bizarre region is accessible to us, and spacecraft could travel
through it without disappearing into the black hole. According to
detailed calculations, objects grazing the ergoregion could be catapulted back out into space at tremendous speeds. In other words,
the ejected object could leave the ergoregion with more energy
than it had initially, having extracted added energy from
the hole’s rotation. This is called the Penrose process, after
Roger Penrose, the British mathematician who proposed it.

A Rotating Supermassive Black Hole This artist’s

energy and angular momentum from the black hole.

Mass, charge, and angular momentum are the only three
properties that a black hole possesses. This simplicity is the essence
of the no-hair theorem, first formulated in the early 1970s: “Black
holes have no hair.” Once matter has fallen into the hole, any and
all additional properties (“hair”) carried by the matter have disappeared from the universe. Hence, these properties can have no
effect on the structure of the hole.

Imagine that you are on board a spacecraft at a safe
distance from a 5-M䉺 black hole. A distance of 1000
Schwarzschild radii, or 15,000 km, would suffice. You
now release a space probe and let it fall into the black hole. To
make the probe easier to track, it is coated with a phosphorescent
paint that emits a blue glow. You also equip the probe with a
video camera that transmits images of the view of the approaching black hole. What will you see as the probe falls?
As Figure 22-21a shows, at 1000 Schwarzschild radii from
the black hole the video camera
would send back a rather normal The gravitational field of
view of space. But as the probe apa black hole distorts the
proaches the black hole, the bending
of light by the black hole (see Sec- image of other stars
tion 22-2) becomes more pronounced. Light rays passing close to the back hole are deflected
so severely that at close range, the camera will actually see multiple images of the same stars (Figure 22-21b).

How will the probe itself look from your vantage point at a
safe distance? You might expect that as the probe falls, its speed
should continue to increase. This is true up to a point. But as the
probe approaches the event horizon, where the black hole’s gravity is extremely strong, the gravitational slowing of time becomes
so pronounced that the probe will appear to slow down! From
your point of view, the spacecraft takes an infinite amount of time
to reach the event horizon, where it will appear to remain suspended for all eternity.
To watch these effects, however, you will need special equipment. The reason is the gravitational redshift: As the probe falls,
the light reaching you from the probe is shifted to longer and
longer wavelengths. The probe’s blue glow will turn green, then
yellow, then red, and eventually fade into infrared wavelengths
that your unaided eye cannot detect.
If you could view the falling probe with infrared goggles, you
would see it come to an unpleasant end. Near the event horizon,
the strength of the black hole’s gravity increases dramatically as
the probe moves just a short distance closer to the hole. In fact,
the side of the probe nearest the black hole feels a much stronger
gravitational pull than the side opposite the hole. These tidal
forces are like those that the Moon exerts on the Earth (see
Section 4-8), but tremendously stronger. Furthermore, the sides of
the probe are pulled together, since the hole’s gravity makes them
fall in straight lines aimed at the center of the hole. The net effect
is that the probe will be stretched out along the line pointing toward the hole, and squeezed together along the perpendicular
directions (Figure 22-22). The stretching is so great that it will rip
the probe into atoms, and even rip the atoms apart.
Someone foolhardy enough to ride along with the probe
would have a very different view of the fall than yours. From this

astronaut’s point of view, there is no slowing of time, and the
probe continues its fall through the event horizon into the singularity. The astronaut is unlikely to enjoy the ride, however, since
he will be disintegrated by tidal forces as he falls inward toward
the singularity.
Could a black hole somehow be connected to another part of
spacetime, or even some other universe? General relativity predicts that such connections, called wormholes, can exist for rotating black holes. Box 22-3 discusses the possibility that such
wormholes really exist.

22-9 Black holes evaporate
With all the mass of a black hole hidden behind its event horizon
and collapsed into a singularity, it may seem that there is no way
of getting mass from the black hole back out into the universe.
But in fact there is, as Stephen Hawking pointed out in the 1970s.
To understand how this is possible, we must look at the behavior of matter at the submicroscopic scale of nuclei, and electrons.
The Heisenberg uncertainty principle is a basic tenet of submicroscopic physics. This principle states that you cannot determine

Wormholes and Time Machines
ormholes have become a staple of science fiction. They
are certainly a convenient plot device: The gallant crew
W
flies their spaceship into one end of a wormhole, and a short
time later they emerge many light-years away. Time machines,
too, have been part of science fiction ever since H. G. Wells
published his classic novel The Time Machine at the end of the
nineteenth century. What would it be like to go back in time
and watch famous historical events—or even change history?
Wormholes and time machines challenge our normal ideas
about space and time. So, too, does the general theory of relativity. Could it be that this theory really makes it possible to
travel through wormholes and to travel in time?
In the 1930s, Einstein and his colleague Nathan Rosen discovered that a black hole could possibly connect our universe
with a second domain of space and time that is separate from
ours. The first diagram shows this connection, called an
Einstein-Rosen bridge. You could think of the upper surface as
our universe and the lower surface as a “parallel universe.” Alternatively, the upper and lower surfaces could be different regions of our own universe. In that case, an Einstein-Rosen
bridge would connect our universe with itself, forming a wormhole, shown in the second diagram.
A wormhole may seem like a shortcut to distant places in
our universe, but detailed calculations reveal a major obstacle.
The powerful gravity of a black hole causes the wormhole to
collapse almost as soon as it forms. As a result, to get from
one side of a wormhole to the other, you would have to travel
faster than the speed of light, which is not possible.
Caltech physicists Kip Thorne, Michael Morris, and Ulvi
Yurtsever have proposed a scheme that might get around the
difficulty of a collapsing wormhole. According to general relativity, they point out, pressure as well as mass can be a source
of gravity. Normally we do not see the gravitational effects of
pressure because they are so small. Thorne and his colleagues
speculate that a technologically advanced civilization might
someday be able to use pressure to produce antigravity strong
enough to keep the wormhole open.
If a wormhole could be held open, it could also be a time
machine. To see how, imagine you take one end of a wormhole and move it around for a while at speeds very near the
speed of light. As we saw in Box 22-1, such motion causes
clocks to slow down. Thus, when you stop moving that end of
the wormhole, you find that it has not aged as much as the stationary end. In other words, one side of the wormhole has a
different time from the other. As a result, you could go into
one end of the wormhole at a late time and come out at an
early time. For example, you might go in at 10 A.M. and come
out at 9 A.M.
Time machines challenge ordinary logic. If you could get
back from a trip an hour before you left, you could meet yourself and tell yourself what a nice journey you had. Then both

of you could take the trip. If you and your twin return just before you both left, there would be four of you. And all four of
you could take the trip again. And then all eight of you. Then
all sixteen of you . . .
Making copies of yourself is an example of how time machines violate causality, the notion that effects must follow
their causes. To date, we have never seen a violation of causality. Many scientists would therefore like to show that time machines cannot exist. The British astrophysicist Stephen Hawking
points to one strong bit of observational evidence against time
machines: We are not being visited by hordes of tourists from
the future. If we could discover why nature seems to preclude
time machines, we would have a much deeper understanding
of the nature of space and time.

precisely both the position and the speed of a subatomic particle.
Over extremely short distances or times, a certain amount of
“fuzziness” is built into the nature of reality.
The Heisenberg uncertainty principle leads to the concept of
virtual pairs: At every point in space, pairs of particles and antiparticles are constantly being created and destroyed. An antiparticle is quite like an ordinary particle except that it has an opposite
electric charge and can annihilate an ordinary particle so that
both disappear, usually leaving a pair of photons in their place.
In the case of virtual pairs, the process of creation and annihilation occurs over such incredibly brief time intervals that these virtual particles and antiparticles cannot be observed directly.
Think about a tiny black hole. Furthermore, think about the
momentary creation of a virtual pair of an electron and a positron
(the antiparticle of an electron) just outside the hole’s event horizon. It may happen that one of the particles falls into the black
hole. Its partner is then deprived of a counterpart with which to
annihilate and must therefore become a real particle. To accomplish this conversion, some of the energy of the black hole’s gravity must be converted into matter, according to E  mc 2. This
decreases the mass of the black hole by a corresponding amount,
and the particle is free to escape from the hole. In this way, particles can quantum-mechanically “leak” out of a black hole, carrying some of the hole’s mass with them (Figure 22-23).
The less mass a black hole has, the more easily particles can
leak out through its event horizon.
Jacob Bekenstein and Stephen A fundamental
Hawking proved mathematically uncertainty in physical
that you can speak of the temperaknowledge makes it
ture of a black hole as a way of describing the amounts of energy possible for black holes
carried away by particles leaking out to emit particles and
of it. For example, a 1-trillion-ton radiation into space
(1015 kg) black hole emits particles
and energy as if it were a blackbody with a temperature of nearly
109 K.
For stellar-mass black holes, such as Cygnus X-1, this effect
is negligible over time spans of billions of years. The reason is that
the temperature of a black hole is inversely proportional to the
black hole’s mass. Compared to a trillion-ton black hole, a
5-M䉺 (1031 kg) hole has a mass that is 1016 times greater and
a temperature T that is only 1016 as much:
T  1016  109 K  107 K
This temperature is barely above absolute zero. In other
words, ordinary black holes have such low temperatures that particles hardly ever manage to escape from them.
The story is different for low-mass black holes, such as the
primordial black holes we discussed in Section 22-5. As particles
escape from a small black hole, the mass of the black hole decreases, making its temperature go up. As its temperature rises,
still more particles escape, further decreasing the hole’s mass and
forcing the temperature still higher. This runaway process of
black hole evaporation finally causes the hole to vanish altogether. During its final seconds of evaporation, the hole gives up
the last of its mass in a violent burst of energy equal to the detonation of a billion megaton hydrogen bombs.

1. Pairs of virtual particles spontaneously appear
and annihilate everywhere in the universe.
2. If a pair appears just outside a black hole’s
event horizon, tidal forces can pull the pair apart,

Figure 22-23
Evaporation of a Black Hole This illustration shows two pairs of virtual
particles—an electron (e) and a positron (e), and a pair of photons
( )—appearing just outside the event horizon of a black hole. If one
member of the pair escapes and carries energy away from the black
hole, the black hole decreases in mass and the event horizon shrinks.

A 1010-kg primordial black hole (comparable to the mass of
Mount Everest) would take about 15 billion years to evaporate.
This is close to the present age of the universe. If primordial black
holes were formed in the Big Bang, we would expect to see some
of them going through the explosive final stages of evaporation.
To date, however, there is no compelling evidence that we have
seen such evaporations taking place, and many astronomers suspect that there are no primordial black holes.
By contrast, a 5-M䉺 black hole would take more than 1062 years
to evaporate, and a supermassive black hole of 5 million solar
masses would take more than 1080 years. These time spans are
far longer than the age of the universe. We can safely predict that
the black holes we have observed to date will remain as black
holes for the foreseeable future.

rulers that are moving with respect to the observer. This effect becomes significant only if the clock or ruler is moving at a substantial fraction of the speed of light.
• Space and time are not wholly independent of each other, but
are aspects of a single entity called spacetime.
The General Theory of Relativity: Published by Einstein in 1915,
this is a theory of gravity. Any massive object causes space to
curve and time to slow down, and these effects manifest themselves as a gravitational force. These distortions of space and time
are most noticeable in the vicinity of large masses or compact
objects.
• The general theory of relativity is our most accurate description
of gravitation. It predicts a number of phenomena, including the
bending of light by gravity and the gravitational redshift, whose
existence has been confirmed by observation and experiment.
• The general theory of relativity also predicts the existence of
gravitational waves, which are ripples in the overall geometry of
space and time produced by moving masses. Gravitational waves
have been detected indirectly, and specialized antennas are under
construction to make direct measurement of the gravitational
waves from cosmic cataclysms.
Black Holes: If a stellar corpse has a mass greater than about
2 to 3 M䉺, gravitational compression will overwhelm any and all
forms of internal pressure. The stellar corpse will collapse to such
a high density that its escape speed exceeds the speed of light.
Observing Black Holes: Black holes have been detected using indirect methods.
• Some binary star systems contain a black hole. In such a system, gases captured from the companion star by the black hole
emit detectable X rays.
• Many galaxies have supermassive black holes at their centers.
These are detected by observing the motions of material around
the black hole.

Properties of Black Holes: The entire mass of a black
hole is concentrated in an infinitely dense singularity.

• The singularity is surrounded by a surface called the event horizon, where the escape speed equals the speed of light. Nothing—
not even light—can escape from inside the event horizon.
• A black hole has only three physical properties: mass, electric
charge, and angular momentum.
• A rotating black hole (one with angular momentum) has an ergoregion around the outside of the event horizon. In the ergoregion, space and time themselves are dragged along with the
rotation of the black hole.
• Black holes can evaporate, but in most cases at an extremely
slow rate.

Problem-solving tips and tools
Remember that the time to travel a certain distance is equal
to the distance divided by the speed, and that the density of
an object is its mass divided by its volume. The volume of a
sphere of radius r is 4 r3/3. Section 4-7 describes Newton’s
law of universal gravitation. Box 4-4 shows how to use Newton’s formulation of Kepler’s third law, which explicitly includes masses; when using this formula, note that the period
P must be expressed in seconds, the semimajor axis a in meters, and the masses in kilograms. For another version of this
formula, in which period is in years, semimajor axis in AU,
and masses in solar masses, see Section 17-9.

37. In the binary system of two neutron stars discovered by Hulse
and Taylor (Section 22-2), one of the neutron stars is a pulsar. The distance between the two stars varies between
1.1 and 4.8 times the radius of the Sun. The time interval between pulses from the pulsar is not constant: It is greatest
when the two stars are closest to each other and least when
the two stars are farthest apart. Explain why this is consistent with the gravitational slowing of time (Figure 22-7a).
38. Find the total mass of the neutron star binary system discovered by Hulse and Taylor (Section 22-2), for which the orbital period is 7.75 hours and the average distance between

n a clear, moonless night, away from the glare of city lights,
you can often see a hazy, luminous band stretching across
the sky. This band, called the Milky Way, extends all the
way around the celestial sphere. The upper of the two accompanying photographs is centered on the brightest part of the Milky
Way, in the constellation Sagittarius.
Galileo, the first person to view the Milky Way with a telescope, discovered that it is composed of countless dim stars. Today,
we realize that the Milky Way is actually a disk tens of thousands
of parsecs across containing hundreds of billions of stars—one of
which is our own Sun—as well as vast quantities of gas and dust.
This vast assemblage of matter is collectively called the Milky
Way Galaxy.
Just as Galileo’s telescope revealed aspects of the Milky Way
that the naked eye could not, modern astronomers use telescopes
at nonvisible wavelengths to peer through our Galaxy’s obscuring dust and observe what visible-light telescopes never could. For
example, the lower of the two accompanying photographs is an
infrared image that shows hundreds of thousands of stars near the
center of the Galaxy. As we will see, radio, infrared, and X-ray
observations reveal that at the very center of the Galaxy lies a
black hole with a mass of 3.7 million Suns.
Modern astronomers have also discovered that most of the
Milky Way’s mass is not in its stars, gas, or dust, but in a halo
of dark matter that emits no measurable radiation. What the
character of this dark matter could be remains one of the greatest open questions in astronomy and physics.
The Milky Way is just one of myriad galaxies, or systems of
stars and interstellar matter, that are spread across the observable
universe. By studying our home Milky Way Galaxy, we begin to

explore the universe on a grand scale. Instead of focusing on individual stars, we look at the overall arrangement and history of
a huge stellar community of which the Sun is a member. In this
way, we gain insights into galaxies in general and prepare ourselves to ask fundamental questions about the cosmos.

The Problem: Interstellar Extinction

23-1 The Sun is located in the disk
of our Galaxy, about 8000 parsecs
from the galactic center
Eighteenth-century astronomers were the first to suspect that because the Milky Way completely encircles us, all the stars in the
sky are part of an enormous disk of stars—the Milky Way Galaxy.
As we learned in Section 1-4, a galaxy is an immense collection
of stars and interstellar matter, far larger than a star cluster. We
have an edge-on view from inside the disk of our own Milky Way
Galaxy, which is why the Milky Way appears as a band around
the sky (Figure 23-1).

Locating the Sun Within the Galaxy: Early Attempts
But where within this disk is our own Sun? Until the twentieth
century, the prevailing opinion was that the Sun and planets lie
at the Galaxy’s center. One of the first to come to this conclusion
was the eighteenth-century English astronomer William Herschel,
who discovered the planet Uranus and was a pioneering cataloger
of binary star systems (see Section 17-9). Herschel’s approach to
determining the Sun’s position within the Galaxy was to count
the number of stars in each of 683 regions of the sky. He reasoned that he should see the greatest number of stars toward the
Galaxy’s center and a lesser number toward the Galaxy’s edge.
Herschel found approximately the same density of stars all
along the Milky Way. Therefore, he concluded that we are at the
center of our Galaxy (Figure 23-2). In the early 1900s, the Dutch
astronomer Jacobus Kapteyn came to essentially the same conclusion by analyzing the brightness and proper motions of a large
number of stars. According to Kapteyn, the Milky Way is about
17 kpc (17 kiloparsecs ⫽ 17,000 parsecs, or 55,000 light-years)
in diameter, with the Sun near its center.

If we look
out of
the plane
of our
Galaxy…

…we see
relatively
few stars.

Both Herschel and Kapteyn were wrong about the Sun being at
the center of our Galaxy. The reason for their mistake was discerned in 1930 by Robert J. Trumpler of Lick Observatory. While
studying star clusters, Trumpler discovered that the more remote
clusters appear unusually dim—more so than would be expected
from their distances alone. As a result, Trumpler concluded that
interstellar space must not be a perfect vacuum: It must contain
dust that absorbs or scatters light from distant stars.
Like the stars themselves, interstellar dust is concentrated in
the plane of the Galaxy (see Section 18-2). As a result, it obscures
our view within the plane and makes distant objects appear dim,
an effect called interstellar extinction. Great patches of interstellar dust are clearly visible in wide-angle photographs such as the
one that opens this chapter. Thanks to interstellar extinction,
Herschel and Kapteyn were actually seeing only the nearest stars
in the Galaxy. Hence, they had no idea of either the enormous
size of the Galaxy or of the vast number of stars concentrated
around the galactic center.

ANALOGY Herschel and Kapteyn faced much the same
dilemma as a lost motorist on a foggy night. Unable to see more
than a city block in any direction, he would have a hard time
deciding what part of town he was in. If the fog layer were relatively shallow, however, our motorist would be able to see the
lights from tall buildings that extend above the fog, and in that
way he could determine his location (Figure 23-3a).
The same principle applies to our Galaxy. While interstellar
dust in the plane of our Galaxy hides the sky covered by the
Milky Way, we have an almost unobscured view out of the plane
(that is, to either side of the Milky Way). To find our location in

erroneous idea that the Sun is at the center of the Galaxy. (Yerkes

The Breakthrough: Globular Clusters and Variable Stars

Fortunately, bright objects of the sort we need do in
fact exist. They are the globular clusters, a class of star
clusters associated with the Galaxy but which lie outside its plane (Figure 23-3b). As we saw in Section 19-4, a typical globular cluster is a spherical distribution of roughly 106 stars

fog layer.

packed in a volume only a few hundred light-years across (see
Figure 19-12).
However, to use globular clusters to determine our location
in the Galaxy, we must first determine the distances from the
Earth to these clusters. (Think again
of our lost motorist—glimpsing the Observations of pulsating
lights of a skyscraper through the
variable stars revealed
fog may be useful to the motorist,
the immense size of the
but only if he can tell how far away
the skyscraper is.) Pulsating variable Milky Way
stars in globular clusters provide the
distances, giving astronomers the key to the dimensions of our
Galaxy.
In 1912, the American astronomer Henrietta Leavitt reported
her important discovery of the period-luminosity relation for
Cepheid variables. As we saw in Section 19-6, Cepheid variables
are pulsating stars that vary periodically in brightness (see Figure
19-18). Leavitt studied numerous Cepheids in the Small Magellanic Cloud (a small galaxy near the Milky Way) and found their
periods to be directly related to their average luminosities. Figure
23-4 shows that the longer a Cepheid’s period, the greater its
luminosity.
The period-luminosity law is an important tool in astronomy
because it can be used to determine distances. For example, suppose you find a Cepheid variable in the sky. By measuring its period and using a graph like Figure 23-4, you can determine the
star’s average luminosity. Knowing the star’s average luminosity,
you can find out how far away the star must be in order to give
the observed brightness. (Box 17-2 explains how this is done.)
Shortly after Leavitt’s discovery of the period-luminosity law,
Harlow Shapley, a young astronomer at the Mount Wilson Observatory in California, began studying a family of pulsating stars
closely related to Cepheid variables called RR Lyrae variables.
The light curve of an RR Lyrae variable is similar to that of a

Figure 23-4
Period and Luminosity for Cepheid and RR Lyrae Variables This
graph shows the relationship between period and luminosity for Cepheid
variables and RR Lyrae variables. Cepheids come in a broad range of
luminosities: The more luminous the Cepheid, the longer its pulsation
period. By contrast, RR Lyrae variables are horizontal branch stars that all
have roughly the same average luminosity of about 100 L䉺.

Cepheid, but RR Lyrae variables have shorter pulsation periods
and lower peak luminosities (see Figure 23-4).
The tremendous importance of RR Lyrae variables is that
they are commonly found in globular clusters (Figure 23-5). By
using the period-luminosity relationship for these stars, Shapley
was able to determine the distances to the 93 globular clusters
then known. He found that some of them were more than 100,000
light-years from Earth. The large values of these distances immediately suggested that the Galaxy was much larger than Herschel
or Kapteyn had thought.
Another striking property of globular clusters is how they are
distributed across the sky. Ordinary stars and open clusters of
stars (see Section 18-6, especially Figures 18-18 and 18-19) are
rather uniformly spread along the Milky Way. However, the majority of the 93 globular clusters that Shapley studied are located
in one-half of the sky, widely scattered around the portion of the
Milky Way that is in the constellation Sagittarius.
From the directions to the globular clusters and their distances from us, Shapley mapped out the three-dimensional distribution of these clusters in space. In 1920 he concluded that the
globular clusters form a huge spherical distribution centered not
on the Earth but rather about a point in the Milky Way several
kiloparsecs away in the direction of Sagittarius (see Figure 23-3b).
This point, reasoned Shapley, must coincide with the center of
our Galaxy, because of gravitational forces between the disk of
the Galaxy and the “halo” of globular clusters. Therefore, by lo-

arrows point to three RR Lyrae variables in the
globular cluster M55, located in the constellation Sagittarius. From the
average apparent brightness (as seen in this photograph) and average
luminosity (known to be roughly 100 L䉺) of these variable stars,
astronomers have deduced that the distance to M55 is 6500 pc
(20,000 ly). (Harvard Observatory)

cating the center of the distribution of globular clusters, Shapley
was in effect measuring the location of the galactic center.

Modern-Day Measurements
Since Shapley’s pioneering observations, many astronomers have
measured the distance from the Sun to the galactic nucleus, the
center of our Galaxy. Shapley’s estimate of this distance was too
large by about a factor of 2, because he did not take into account
the effects of interstellar extinction (which were not well understood at the time). Today, the generally accepted distance to the
galactic nucleus is about 8 kpc (26,000 ly); the actual distance
could be greater or less than that value by about 1 kpc (3300 ly).
Just as Copernicus and Galileo showed that the Earth was
not at the center of the solar system, Shapley and his successors
showed that the solar system lies nowhere near the center of the
Galaxy. We see that the Earth indeed occupies no special position
in the universe.

23-2 Observations at nonvisible wavelengths
reveal the shape of the Galaxy
At visible wavelengths, light suffers so much interstellar extinction
that the galactic nucleus is totally obscured from view. But the
amount of interstellar extinction is roughly inversely proportional

Our Galaxy

to wavelength. In other words, the longer the wavelength, the
farther radiation can travel through interstellar dust without being scattered or absorbed. As a result, we can see farther into
the plane of the Milky Way at infrared wavelengths than at visible wavelengths, and radio waves can traverse the Galaxy freely.
For this reason, telescopes sensitive to these nonvisible wavelengths are important tools for studying the structure of our
Galaxy.

frared spectrum most different in
wavelength from visible light (see Figure 5-7). At these wavelengths, interstellar dust radiates more strongly than stars, so a
far-infrared view of the sky is principally a view of where the dust
is. In 1983 the Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) scanned the
sky with a 60-cm reflecting telescope at far-infrared wavelengths,

giving the panoramic view of the Milky Way’s dust shown in
Figure 23-6a.
In 1990 an instrument on the Cosmic Background Explorer
(COBE) satellite scanned the sky at near-infrared wavelengths,
that is, relatively short wavelengths closer to the visible spectrum.
Figure 23-6b shows the resulting near-infrared view of the plane
of the Milky Way. At near-infrared wavelengths, interstellar dust
does not emit very much light. Hence, the light sources in Figure
23-6b are stars, which do emit strongly in the near-infrared (especially the cool stars, such as red giants and supergiants). Because interstellar dust causes little interstellar extinction in the
near-infrared, many of the stars whose light is recorded in Figure
23-6b lie deep within the Milky Way.
Observations such as those shown in Figure 23-6, along with
the known distance to the center of the Galaxy, have helped astronomers to establish the dimensions of the Galaxy. The disk of
our Galaxy is about 50 kpc (160,000 ly) in diameter and about
0.6 kpc (2000 ly) thick, as shown in Figure 23-7. The center of
the Galaxy is surrounded by a distribution of stars, called the central bulge, which is about 2 kpc (6500 ly) in diameter. This central bulge is clearly visible in Figure 23-6b. The spherical
distribution of globular clusters traces the halo of the Galaxy.
This structure is not unique to our Milky Way Galaxy.
Figure 23-8 shows another galaxy whose dust and stars lie in a
disk and that has a central bulge of stars, just like the Milky Way.

By contrast, stars in the disk travel along orbits that remain in the
disk (Figure 23-9).
The stars in the disk are mostly young, metal-rich, Population I stars like the Sun. The disk of a galaxy like the Milky Way
appears bluish because its light is dominated by radiation from
hot O and B main-sequence stars. Such stars have very short
main-sequence lifetimes (see Section 19-1, especially Table
19-1), so they must be quite young by astronomical standards.
Hence, their presence shows that there must be active star formation in the galactic disk. By contrast, no O or B stars are
present in the halo, which implies that star formation ceased
there long ago.
The central bulge contains both Population I stars and metalpoor Population II stars. Since Population II stars are thought to
have formed in the history of the universe, this suggests that some
of the stars in the bulge are quite ancient while others were created more recently. The central bulge looks yellowish or reddish
because it contains many red giants and red supergiants (see
Figure 1-7), but does not contain luminous, short-lived, blue O or
B stars. Hence, there cannot be ongoing star formation in the central bulge. The same is true for other galaxies whose structure is
similar to that of the Milky Way (Figure 23-10).
Why are there such different populations of stars in the
halo, disk, and central bulge? Why has star formation stopped
in some regions of the Galaxy but continues in other regions?
The answers to these questions are related to the way that stars,
as well as the gas and dust from which stars form, move within
the Galaxy.

Only Population I (metal-rich) stars are found
in the disk. The presence of hot, blue, young
O and B stars indicates active star formation.

Both Population I (metal-rich) and Population II (metal-poor)
stars are found in the central bulge –– but there are no young

23-3 Observations of cold hydrogen clouds
and star-forming regions reveal that our
Galaxy has spiral arms
The galaxies shown in Figure 23-8 and Figure 23-10 both have
spiral arms, spiral-shaped concentrations of gas and dust that extend outward from the center in a shape reminiscent of a pinwheel. This would lead us to suspect that our own Milky Way
Galaxy also has spiral arms. However, because interstellar dust
obscures our visible-light view in the plane of our Galaxy, a detailed understanding of the structure of the galactic disk had to
wait until the development of radio astronomy. Thanks to their
long wavelengths, radio waves can penetrate the interstellar
medium even more easily than infrared light and can travel without being scattered or absorbed. As we shall see in this section,
both radio and optical observations reveal that our Galaxy does
indeed have spiral arms.

Hydrogen is by far the most abundant element in the
universe (see Figure 8-4 in Section 8-2). Hence, by
looking for concentrations of hydrogen gas, we should
be able to detect important clues about the distribution of matter
in our Galaxy. Unfortunately, ordinary visible-light telescopes are of The magnetic nature of

detect cold clouds of gas
to high energy levels (see Section
5-8, and especially Figure 5-24). This strewn throughout the
is quite unlikely to occur in the cold galactic disk
depths of interstellar space. Furthermore, even if there are some hydrogen atoms that glow strongly
at visible wavelengths, interstellar extinction due to dust (see
Section 23-1) would make it impossible to see this glow from distant parts of the Galaxy.
What makes it possible to map out the distribution of hydrogen in our Galaxy is that even cold hydrogen clouds emit radio
waves. As we saw in Section 23-2, radio waves can easily penetrate the interstellar medium, so we can detect the radio emission
from such cold clouds no matter where in the Galaxy they lie. The
hydrogen in these clouds is neutral—that is, not ionized—and is
called H I. (This distinguishes it from ionized hydrogen, which is
designated H II.) To understand how H I clouds can emit radio
waves, we must probe a bit more deeply into the structure of protons and electrons, the particles of which hydrogen atoms are made.
In addition to having mass and charge, particles such as protons and electrons possess a tiny amount of angular momentum
(that is, rotational motion) commonly called spin. Very roughly,
you can visualize a proton or electron as a tiny, electrically charged
sphere that spins on its axis. Because electric charges in motion
generate magnetic fields, a proton or electron behaves like a tiny
magnet with a north pole and a south pole (Figure 23-11).
If you have ever played with magnets, you know that two
magnets attract when the north pole of one magnet is next to the
south pole of the other and repel when two like poles (both north

of magnets is high when their north poles or their south poles are near

(b) Thanks to their spin, electrons and protons are both tiny magnets.
When the electron flips from the higher-energy configuration (with its

words, the energy of the two magnets is least when opposite poles
are together and highest when like poles are together. Hence, as
shown in Figure 23-11b, the energy of a hydrogen atom is slightly
different depending on whether the spins of the proton and electron are in the same direction or opposite directions. (According
to the laws of quantum mechanics, these are the only two possibilities; the spins cannot be at random angles.)
If the spin of the electron changes its orientation from the
higher-energy configuration to the lower-energy one—called a

spin-flip transition—a photon is emitted. The energy difference
between the two spin configurations is very small, only about
10⫺6 as great as those between different electron orbits (see
Figure 5-24). Therefore, the photon emitted in a spin-flip transition
between these configurations has only a small energy, and thus its
wavelength is a relatively long 21 cm—a radio wavelength.
The spin-flip transition in neutral hydrogen was first predicted in 1944 by the Dutch astronomer Hendrik van de Hulst.
His calculations suggested that it should be possible to detect the
21-cm radio emission from interstellar hydrogen, although a very
sensitive radio telescope would be required. In 1951, Harold
Ewen and Edward Purcell at Harvard University first succeeded
in detecting this faint emission from hydrogen between the stars.

points 1, 2, 3, and 4. However, the radio waves from these various clouds are Doppler shifted by slightly different amounts, because the clouds are moving at different speeds as they travel with
the rotating Galaxy.

The distribution of gas in the Milky Way is not uniform but is actually quite frothy. In fact, our Sun lies
near the edge of an irregularly shaped region within
which the interstellar medium is very thin but at very high temperatures (about 106 K). This region, called the Local Bubble, is
several hundred parsecs across. The Local Bubble may have been
carved out by a supernova that exploded nearby some 300,000
years ago.
Remarkably, spin-flip transitions are used not only to map
our Galaxy but also to map the internal structure of the human
body. Box 23-1 on page 614 discusses this application, called
magnetic resonance imaging.

Detecting Our Galaxy’s Spiral Arms
The detection of 21-cm radio radiation was a major breakthrough
that permitted astronomers to reveal the presence of spiral arms
in the galactic disk. Figure 23-13 shows how this was done. Suppose that you aim a radio telescope along a particular line of sight
across the Galaxy. Your radio receiver, located at S (the position

They have a moderate blueshift.
• Hydrogen cloud 2 is approaching us at a
faster speed: It has a larger blueshift.
• Hydrogen cloud 4 is neither approaching nor

Figure 23-13
A Technique for Mapping Our Galaxy If we look within the plane of
our Galaxy from our position at S, hydrogen clouds at different locations
(shown as 1, 2, 3, and 4) along our line of sight are moving at slightly
different speeds relative to us. As a result, radio waves from these
various gas clouds are subjected to slightly different Doppler shifts. This
permits radio astronomers to sort out the gas clouds and thus map the
Galaxy.

hanks to their spin, protons and electrons act
like microscopic bar magnets. In a hydrogen
T
atom, the interaction between the magnetism of the

electron and that of the proton gives rise to the
21-cm radio emission. But these particles can also interact with
outside magnetic fields, such as that produced by a large electromagnet. This is the physical principle behind magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), an important diagnostic tool of modern
medicine.
Much of the human body is made of water. Every water
molecule has two hydrogen atoms, each of which has a nucleus
made of a single proton. If a person’s body is placed in a
strong magnetic field, the spins of the protons in the hydrogen
atoms of their body can either be in the same direction as the
field (“aligned”) or in the direction opposite to the field (“opposed”). The aligned orientation has lower energy, and therefore the majority of protons end up with their spins in this
orientation. But if a radio wave of just the right wavelength is
now sent through the person’s body, an aligned proton can absorb a radio photon and flip its spin into the higher-energy,
opposed orientation. How much of the radio wave is absorbed
depends on the number of protons in the body, which in turns
depends on how much water (and, thus, how much watercontaining tissue) is in the body.
In magnetic resonance imaging, a magnetic field is used
whose strength varies from place to place. The difference in energy between the opposed and aligned orientations of a proton
depends on the strength of the magnetic field, so radio waves
will only be absorbed at places where this energy difference is
equal to the energy of a radio photon. (This equality is called
resonance, which is how magnetic resonance imaging gets its
name.) By varying the magnetic field strength over the body
and the wavelength of the radio waves, and by measuring how

It is important to remember that the Doppler shift reveals
only motion along the line of sight (review Figure 5-26). In
Figure 23-13, cloud 2 has the highest speed along our line of
sight, because it is moving directly toward us. Consequently, the
radio waves from cloud 2 exhibit a larger Doppler shift than
those from the other three clouds along our line of sight. Because
clouds 1 and 3 are at the same distance from the galactic center,
they have the same orbital speed. The fraction of their velocity
parallel to our line of sight is also the same, so their radio waves
exhibit the same Doppler shift, which is less than the Doppler
shift of cloud 2. Finally, cloud 4 is the same distance from the
galactic center as the Sun. This cloud is thus orbiting the Galaxy
at the same speed as the Sun, resulting in no net motion along the
line of sight. Radio waves from cloud 4, as well as from hydrogen gas near the Sun, are not Doppler shifted at all.
These various Doppler shifts cause radio waves from gases in
different parts of the Galaxy to arrive at our radio telescopes with

head.
Unlike X-ray images, which show only the densest parts
of the body, such as bones and teeth, magnetic resonance imaging can be used to view less dense (but water-containing)
soft tissue. Just as the 21-cm radio emission has given astronomers a clear view of what were hidden regions of our
Galaxy, magnetic resonance imaging allows modern medicine
to see otherwise invisible parts of the human body.

wavelengths slightly different from 21 cm. It is therefore possible
to sort out the various gas clouds and thus produce a map of the
Galaxy like that shown in Figure 23-14.
Figure 23-14 shows that neutral hydrogen gas is not spread
uniformly around the disk of the Galaxy but is concentrated
into numerous arched lanes. Similar features are seen in other
galaxies beyond the Milky Way. As an example, the galaxy in
Figure 23-15a has prominent spiral arms outlined by hot, luminous, blue main-sequence stars and the red emission nebulae
(H II regions) found near many such stars. Stars of this sort are
very short-lived, so these features indicate that spiral arms are
sites of active, ongoing star formation. The 21-cm radio image
of this same galaxy, shown in Figure 23-15b, shows that spiral
arms are also regions where neutral hydrogen gas is concentrated, similar to the structures in our own Galaxy visible in
Figure 23-14. This similarity is a strong indication that our
Galaxy also has spiral arms.

CAUTION Photographs such as Figure 23-15a can lead to the
impression that there are very few stars between the spiral arms
of a galaxy. Nothing could be further from the truth! In fact,
stars are distributed rather uniformly throughout the disk of a
galaxy like the one in Figure 23-15a; the density of stars in the
spiral arms is only about 5% higher than in the rest of the disk.
The spiral arms stand out nonetheless because they are where
hot, blue O and B stars are found. One such star is about 104
times more luminous than an average star in the disk, so the
light from O and B stars completely dominates the visible appearance of a spiral galaxy. An infrared image such as Figure
23-15c gives a better impression of how stars of all kinds are
distributed through a spiral galaxy’s disk.

H II regions (red) are
in the spiral arms

Figure 23-15a suggests that we can confirm the presence of spiral structure in our own Galaxy by mapping the locations of starforming regions. Such regions are marked by OB associations,
H II regions, and molecular clouds (see Section 18-7). Unfortunately, the first two of these are best observed using visible light,
and interstellar extinction limits the range of visual observations
in the plane of the Galaxy to less than 3 kpc (10,000 ly) from the
Earth. But there are enough OB associations and H II regions
within this range to plot the spiral arms in the vicinity of the Sun.
Molecular clouds are easier to observe at great distances, because molecules of carbon monoxide (CO) in these clouds emit
radio waves that are relatively unaffected by interstellar extinction. Hence, the positions of molecular clouds have been plotted
even in remote regions of the Galaxy, as Figure 18-21 shows. (We
saw in Section 18-7 that CO molecules in molecular clouds emit
more strongly than the hydrogen atoms do, even though hydrogen is the principal constituent of these clouds.)

Two major spiral arms border either side of the Sun’s position. The Sagittarius arm is on the side toward the galactic center. This is the arm you see on June and July nights when you
look at the portion of the Milky Way stretching across Scorpius
and Sagittarius, near the center of the upper photograph on the
first page of this chapter. In December and January, when our
nighttime view is directed away from the galactic center, we see
the Perseus arm. The other major spiral arms cannot be seen at
visible wavelengths thanks to the obscuring effects of dust.
Figure 23-16a also shows that the central bulge of the Milky
Way is not spherical, but is elongated like a bar. This is unlike
the galaxy NGC 7331 shown in Figure 23-8, but similar to the
galaxy M83 depicted in Figure 23-15. The elongated shape of the
central bulge had been suspected since the 1980s; this was confirmed in 2005 using the Spitzer Space Telescope, which was used
to survey the infrared emissions from some 3 million stars in the
central bulge. Thus the artist’s impression shown in Figure 23-16a
is based on observations using both radio wavelengths (for the
spiral arms) and infrared wavelengths (for the central bulge). We
will see in Section 23-5 that this elongated shape may play a crucial role in sustaining the Galaxy’s spiral structure.
Why are the young stars, star-forming regions, and clouds of
neutral hydrogen in our Galaxy all found predominantly in the
spiral arms? To answer this question, we must understand why
spiral arms exist at all. Spiral arms are essentially cosmic “traffic
jams,” places where matter piles up as it orbits around the center
of the Galaxy. This orbital motion, which is essential to grasping
the significance of spiral arms, is our next topic as we continue
our exploration of the Galaxy.

23-4 The rotation of our Galaxy reveals
the presence of dark matter
The spiral arms in the disk of our Galaxy suggest that the disk
rotates. This means that the stars, gas, and dust in our Galaxy are
all orbiting the galactic center. Indeed, if this were not the case,
mutual gravitational attraction would cause the entire Galaxy to
collapse into the galactic center. In the same way, the Moon is
kept from crashing into the Earth and the planets from crashing
into the Sun because of their motion around their orbits (see
Section 4-7).
Measuring the rotation of our Galaxy accurately is a difficult
business. But such challenging measurements have been made, as
we shall see, and the results lead to a remarkable conclusion:
Most of the mass of the Galaxy is in the form of dark matter, a
mysterious sort of material that emits no light at all.

Measuring How the Milky Way Rotates

Taken together, all these observations demonstrate that our
Galaxy has at least four major spiral arms as well as several short
arm segments (Figure 23-16). The Sun is located just outside a relatively short arm segment called the Orion arm, which includes

Radio observations of 21-cm radiation from hydrogen gas provide important clues about our Galaxy’s rotation. Doppler shift
measurements of this radiation indicate that stars and gas all orbit in the same direction around the galactic center, just as the
planets all orbit in the same direction around the Sun. Measurements also show that the orbital speed of stars and gas about the

The Rotation of Our Galaxy (a) This schematic diagram
shows three stars (the Sun and two others) orbiting the
center of the Galaxy. Although they start off lined up, the stars become
increasingly separated as they move along their orbits. Stars inside the
Sun’s orbit overtake and move ahead of the Sun, while stars far from the
galactic center lag behind the Sun. (b) The stars would remain lined up if
the Galaxy rotated like a solid disk. This is not what is observed. (c) If

galactic center is fairly uniform throughout much of the Galaxy’s
disk (Figure 23-17). As a result, stars inside the Sun’s orbit complete a trip around the galactic center more quickly than the Sun,
because the stars have a shorter distance to travel. Conversely,
stars outside the Sun’s orbit take longer to go once around the
galactic center because they have farther to travel. As seen by
Earth-based astronomers moving along with the Sun, stars inside
the Sun’s orbit overtake and pass us, while we overtake and pass
stars outside the Sun’s orbit (Figure 23-17a).

CAUTION Note that when we say that objects in different parts
of the Galaxy orbit at the same speed, we do not mean that the
Galaxy rotates like a solid disk. All parts of a rotating solid
disk—a CD or DVD, for example—take the same time to complete one rotation. Because the outer part of the disk has to
travel around a larger circle than the inner part, the speed (distance per time) is greater in the outer part (Figure 23-17b). By
contrast, the orbital speed of material in our Galaxy is roughly
the same at all distances from the galactic center.
Stars would remain lined up.
Sun’s orbit
Galactic center

(c) If the Sun and stars obeyed Kepler’s
third law, the orbital speed would be less
for stars and gas in larger orbits.

The most familiar examples of orbital motion are the motions of the planets around the Sun. As we saw in Section 4-7, the
farther a planet is from the Sun, the less gravitational force it experiences and the slower the speed it needs to have to remain in
orbit. The same would be true for the orbits of stars and gas in
the Galaxy if they were held in orbit by a single, massive object
at the galactic center (Figure 23-17c). Hence, the 21-cm observations of our Galaxy, which show that the speed does not decrease
with increasing distance from the galactic center, demonstrate
that there is no such single, massive object holding objects in their
galactic orbits.
Instead, what keeps a star in its orbit around the center of
the Galaxy is the combined gravitational force exerted on it by all
of the mass (including stars, gas, and dust) that lies within the
star’s orbit. (It turns out that the gravitational force from matter
outside a star’s orbit has little or no net effect on the star’s motion around the galactic center.) This gives us a tool for determining the Galaxy’s mass and how that mass is distributed.

The Sun’s Orbital Motion and the Mass of the Galaxy
Stars in smaller orbits would

Sun’s orbit

An important example is the orbital motion of the Sun (and the
solar system) around the center of the Galaxy. If we know the
semimajor axis and period of the Sun’s orbit, we can use Newton’s form of Kepler’s third law (described in Section 4-7) to

618

Chapter 23

determine the mass of that portion of the Galaxy that lies within
the orbit. We saw in Section 23-2 that the Sun is about 8000 pc
(26,000 ly) from the galactic center; this is the semimajor axis of
the Sun’s orbit. The orbit is in fact nearly circular, so we can regard 8000 pc as the radius r of the orbit. In one complete trip
around the Galaxy, the Sun travels a distance equal to the circumference of its orbit, which is 2␲r. The time required for one orbit, or orbital period P, is equal to the distance traveled divided
by the Sun’s orbital speed v:

Unfortunately, we cannot tell the Sun’s orbital speed from
21-cm observations, since these reveal only how fast things are
moving relative to the Sun. Instead, we need to measure how the
Sun is moving relative to a background that is not rotating along
with the rest of the Galaxy. Such a background is provided by

BOX 23-2

distant galaxies beyond the Milky Way and by the globular clusters. (Since globular clusters lie outside the plane of the Galaxy,
they do not take part in the rotation of the disk.) By measuring
the Doppler shifts of these objects and averaging their velocities,
astronomers deduce that the Sun is moving along its orbit around
the galactic center at about 220 km/s—about 790,000 kilometers
per hour or 490,000 miles per hour!
Using this information, we find that the Sun’s orbital

Traveling at 790,000 kilometers per hour, it takes the Sun
about 220 million years to complete one trip around the Galaxy.
(In the 65 million years since the demise of the dinosaurs, our solar system has traveled less than a third of the way around its orbit.) The Galaxy is a very large place!
Box 23-2 shows how to combine the radius and period of the
Sun’s orbit to calculate the total mass of all the matter that
lies inside the Sun’s orbit. Such calculations give an answer of
9.0 ⫻ 1010 M䉺 (90 billion solar masses). As Figure 23-7 shows,
the Galaxy extends well beyond the Sun’s orbit, so the mass of
the entire Galaxy must be larger than this.

Estimating the Mass Inside the Sun’s Orbit
he force that keeps the Sun in orbit around the center of
the Galaxy is the gravitational pull of all the matter inteT
rior to the Sun’s orbit. We can estimate the total mass of all of
this matter using Newton’s form of Kepler’s third law (see
Section 4-7 and Box 4-4):
4␲2a3
P2 ⫽ ᎏᎏ
G(M ⫹ M䉺)
In this equation P is the orbital period of the Sun, a is the
semimajor axis of the Sun’s orbit around the galactic center, G
is the universal constant of gravitation, M is the amount of
mass inside the Sun’s orbit, and M䉺 is the mass of the Sun.
Because the Sun is only one of more than 1011 stars in the
Galaxy, the Sun’s mass is minuscule compared to M. Hence,
we can safely replace the sum M ⫹ M䉺 in the above equation
by simply M. If we now assume that the Sun’s orbit is a circle,
the semimajor axis a of the orbit is just the radius of this circle, which we call r. As we saw in Section 25-4, the period P
of the orbit is equal to 2␲ r/v, where v is the Sun’s orbital
speed. You can then show that

(We leave the derivation of this equation as an exercise at the
end of this chapter.)

Now we can insert known values to obtain the mass inside the Sun’s orbit. Being careful to express distance in meters

This estimate involves only mass that is interior to the
Sun’s orbit. Matter outside the Sun’s orbit has no net gravitational effect on the Sun’s motion and thus does not enter into
Kepler’s third law. (This is strictly true only if the matter outside our orbit is distributed over a sphere rather than a disk.
In fact, the dark matter that dominates our Galaxy seems to
have a spherical distribution.)

Our Galaxy

In recent years, astronomers have been astonished to discover
how much matter may lie outside the Sun’s orbit. The clues come
from 21-cm radiation emitted by hydrogen in spiral arms that extend to the outer reaches of the Galaxy. Because we know the true
speed of the Sun, we can convert the Doppler shifts of this radiation into actual speeds for the spiral arms. This calculation gives
us a rotation curve, a graph of the speed of galactic rotation
measured outward from the galactic center (Figure 23-18). We
would expect that for gas clouds beyond the confines of most of
the Galaxy’s mass, the orbital speed should decrease with increasing distance from the Galaxy’s center, just as the orbital speeds
of the planets decrease with increasing distance from the Sun (see
Figure 23-17c). But as Figure 23-18 shows, the Galaxy’s rotation
curve is quite flat, indicating roughly uniform orbital speeds well
beyond the visible edge of the galactic disk.
To explain these nearly uniform orbital speeds in the outer
parts of the Galaxy, astronomers conclude that a large amount
of matter must lie outside the Sun’s orbit. When this matter is
included, the total mass of our
Galaxy could exceed 1012 M䉺 or Unlike the Galaxy’s stars

form of stars. This implies that our forms a roughly spherical

These observations lead to a profound mystery. Stars,
gas, and dust account for only about 10% of the
Galaxy’s total mass. What, then, makes up the remaining 90% of the matter in our Galaxy? Whatever it is, it is dark.
It does not show up on photographs, nor indeed in images made
in any part of the electromagnetic spectrum. This unseen material, which is by far the predominant constituent of our Galaxy,
is called dark matter. We sense its presence only through its gravitational influence on the orbits of stars and gas clouds.

Rotation Curves and the Mystery of Dark Matter

619

CAUTION Be careful not to confuse dark matter with dark
nebulae. A dark nebula like the one in Figure 18-4 emits no visible light, but does radiate at longer wavelengths. By contrast,
no electromagnetic radiation of any kind has yet been discovered coming from dark matter.
Observations of star groupings outside the Milky Way suggest that our Galaxy’s dark matter forms a spherical halo centered on the galactic nucleus, like the halo of globular clusters and
high-velocity stars shown in Figure 23-7. However, the dark matter
halo is much larger; it may extend to a distance of 100–200 kpc
from the center of our Galaxy, some 2 to 4 times the extent of
the visible halo (Figure 23-19). Analysis of the rotation curve in
Figure 23-18 shows that the density of the dark matter halo decreases with increasing distance from the center of the Galaxy.

Dark Matter Speculations
WEB

What is the nature of this mysterious dark matter? One
proposal is that the dark matter halo is composed,
at least in part, of dim objects with masses less than
1 M䉺. These objects, which could include brown dwarfs, white
dwarfs, or black holes, are called massive compact halo objects,
or MACHOs. Astronomers have searched for MACHOs by monitoring the light from distant stars. If a MACHO passes between
us and the star, its gravity will bend the light coming from the
star. (In Section 24-2 we described how gravity can bend starlight.)
As Figure 23-20 shows, the MACHO’s gravity acts like a lens
that focuses the light from the star. This effect, called microlensing, makes the star appear to brighten substantially for a few days.
Astronomers have indeed detected MACHOs in this way,
but not enough to completely solve the dark matter mystery.
MACHOs with very low mass (10⫺6 to 0.1 M䉺 each) do not appear to be a significant part of the dark matter halo. MACHOs
of roughly 0.5 M䉺 are more prevalent, but account for only about
half of the dark matter halo.
The remainder of the dark matter is thought to be much
more exotic. One candidate is a neutrino with a small amount of
mass. If these neutrinos are sufficiently massive, and if enough of
them are present in the halo of the Galaxy, they might constitute
a reasonable fraction of the dark matter. As we saw in Section
16-4, one type of neutrino can transform into another. These
transformations can take place only if neutrinos have a nonzero
amount of mass. Thus, neutrinos must comprise at least part of
the dark matter, though it is not known how much.
Another speculative possibility is a new class of subatomic
particle called weakly interacting massive particles, or WIMPs.
These particles, whose existence is suggested by certain theories
but has not yet been confirmed experimentally, would not emit

mass. Because there is no such decline, there must be an abundance of
invisible dark matter that extends to great distances from the galactic
center.

or absorb electromagnetic radiation. Physicists are attempting to
detect these curious particles, which would have masses 10 to
10,000 times greater than a proton or neutron, by using a large
crystal cooled almost to absolute zero. If a WIMP should enter
this crystal and collide with one of its atoms, the collision will deposit a tiny but measurable amount of heat in the crystal.
As yet, the true nature of dark matter remains a mystery. Furthermore, this mystery is not confined to our own Galaxy. In Chapter 24 we will find that other galaxies have the same sort of rotation
curve as in Figure 23-18, indicating that they also contain vast
amounts of dark matter. Indeed, dark matter appears to make up
most of the mass in our universe. Hence, the quest to understand
dark matter is one of the most important in modern astronomy.

23-5 Spiral arms are caused by density
waves that sweep around the Galaxy
The disk shape of our Galaxy is not difficult to understand. In
Section 8-4 we described what happens when a large number of
objects are put into orbit around a common center: Over time the
objects tend naturally to orbit in the
same plane. This is what happened Our Sun and its solar
when our solar system formed from system were spawned
the solar nebula. There a giant cloud
when a cloud of gas and
of material eventually organized itdust passed through a
self into planets, all of which orbit
in nearly the same plane. In like fash- spiral arm
ion, the disk of our Galaxy, which is
also made up of a large number of individual objects orbiting a
common center, is very flat (see Figure 23-7). Understanding why
our Galaxy has spiral arms presents more of a challenge.

The Winding Dilemma
One early explanation for the Galaxy’s spiral structure was that
the material in the Galaxy somehow condensed into a spiral pattern from the very start. In this view, once stars, gas, and dust
had become concentrated within the spiral arms, the pattern
would remain fixed. This would be possible only if the Galaxy rotated like a solid disk (see Figure 23-17b); the fixed pattern would
be like the spokes on a rotating bicycle wheel. But the reality is
that the Galaxy is not a solid disk. As we have seen, stars, gas,
and dust all orbit the galactic center with approximately the same
speed, as shown in Figure 23-17a. Let us see why this makes it
impossible for a rigid spiral pattern to persist.
Imagine four stars, A, B, C, and D, that originally lie on a
line extending outward from the galactic center (Figure 23-21a).
In a given amount of time, each of the stars travels the same distance around its orbit. But because the innermost star has a
smaller orbit than the others, it takes less time to complete one
orbit. As a result, a line connecting the four stars is soon bent into
a spiral (Figure 23-21b). Moreover, the spiral becomes tighter and
tighter with the passage of time (Figures 23-21c and 23-21d).
This “winding up” of the spiral arms causes the spiral structure
to disappear completely after a few hundred million years—a very
brief time compared to the age of our Galaxy, thought to be
about 13.5 billion (1.35 ⫻ 1010) years.
Figure 23-21 suggests that the Milky Way’s spiral arms ought
to have disappeared by now. The fact that they have not is called
the winding dilemma. It shows that the spiral arms cannot simply be assemblages of stars and interstellar matter that travel
around the Galaxy together, like a troop of soldiers marching in
formation around a flagpole. In other words, the spiral arms
cannot be made of anything material. What, then, can the spiral
arms be?

densely packed than in the rest of the galaxy. As the material of the

star formation, as Figure 23-23 shows.

In the 1940s, the Swedish astronomer Bertil Lindblad proposed
that the spiral arms of a galaxy are actually a pattern that moves
through the Galaxy like ripples on water. This idea was greatly
enhanced and embellished in the 1960s by the American astronomers Chia Chiao Lin and Frank Shu. In this picture, spiral
arms are a kind of wave, like the waves that move across the surface of a pond when you toss a stone into the water. Water molecules pile up at a crest of the wave but spread out again when
the crest passes. By analogy, Lindblad, Lin, and Shu pictured a
pattern of density waves sweeping around the Galaxy. These
waves make matter pile up in the spiral arms, which are the crests
of the waves. Individual parts of the Galaxy’s material are compressed only temporarily when they pass through a spiral arm.
The pattern of spiral arms persists, however, just as the waves
made by a stone dropped in the water can persist for quite awhile
after the stone has sunk.
To understand better how a density wave operates in a galaxy,
think again about a water wave in a pond. If one part of the pond
is disturbed by dropping a stone into it, the molecules in that part
will be displaced a bit. They will nudge the molecules next to
them, causing those molecules to be displaced and to nudge the
molecules beyond them. In this way the wave disturbance spreads
throughout the pond.
In a galaxy, stars play the role of water molecules. Although
stars and interstellar clouds of gas and dust are separated by vast
distances, they can nonetheless exert forces on each other because
they are affected by each other’s gravity. If a region of aboveaverage density should form, its gravitational attraction will draw

Star Formation in the Density-Wave Model A spiral arm

is a region where the density of material is higher than in
the surrounding parts of a galaxy. Interstellar matter moves around the
galactic center rapidly (shown by the red arrows) and is compressed as it
passes through the slow-moving spiral arms (whose motion is shown by
the blue arrows). This compression triggers star formation in the
interstellar matter, so that new stars appear on the “downstream” side of
the densest part of the spiral arms.

nearby material into it. The displacement of this material will
change the gravitational force that it exerts on other parts of the
galaxy, causing additional displacements. In this way a spiralshaped density wave can travel around the disk of a galaxy.

ANALOGY A key feature of density waves is that they move
more slowly around a galaxy than do stars or interstellar matter. To visualize this, imagine workers painting a line down a
busy freeway (Figure 23-22). The cars normally cruise along the
freeway at high speed, but the crew of painters is moving much
more slowly. When the cars come up on the painters, they must
slow down temporarily to avoid hitting anyone. As seen from
the air, cars are jammed together around the painters. An individual car spends only a few moments in the traffic jam before

resuming its usual speed, but the traffic jam itself lasts all day,
inching its way along the road as the painters advance.
A similar crowding takes place when interstellar matter enters a spiral arm. This crowding plays a key role in the formation
of stars and the recycling of the interstellar medium. As interstellar gas and dust moves through a spiral arm, it is compressed into
new nebulae (Figure 23-23). This compression begins the process
by which new stars form, which we described in Section 18-3.
These freshly formed stars continue to orbit around the center of their galaxy, just like the matter from which they formed.
The most luminous among these are the hot, massive, blue O and
B stars, which may have emission nebulae (H II regions) associated with them. These stars have main-sequence lifetimes of only

3 to 15 million years (see Table 19-1), which is very short compared to the 220 million years required for the Sun to make a
complete orbit around the Galaxy.
As a result, these luminous O and B stars can travel only a
relatively short distance before dying off. Therefore, these stars,
and their associated H II regions, are only seen in or slightly
“downstream” of the spiral arm in which they formed. Figure
23-24 illustrates this for the spiral galaxy M51. Less massive stars
have much longer main-sequence lifetimes, and thus their orbits
are able to carry them all around the galactic disk. These lessluminous stars are found throughout the disk, including between
the spiral arms (see Figure 23-15c).
The density-wave model of spiral arms explains why the disk
of our Galaxy is dominated by metal-rich Population I stars. Because the material left over from the death of ancient stars is enriched in heavy elements, new generations of stars formed in
spiral arms are likely to be more metal-rich than their ancestors.
The Cosmic Connections figure illustrates this cycle of star birth
and death in the disk of our Galaxy.
The density-wave model is still under development. One problem is finding a driving mechanism that keeps density waves going in spiral galaxies. After all, density waves expend an enormous
amount of energy to compress the interstellar gas and dust. Hence,
we would expect that density waves should eventually die away,
just as do ripples on a pond. The American astronomers Debra
and Bruce Elmegreen have suggested that gravity can supply that
needed energy. As mentioned in Section 23-3, the central bulge of
our Galaxy is elongated into a bar shape, much like the central
bulge of the galaxy M83 (see Figure 23-15a and Figure 23-16a).
The asymmetric gravitational field of such a bar pulls on the stars
and interstellar matter of a galaxy to generate density waves. Another factor that may help to generate and sustain spiral arms is

the gravitational interactions between galaxies. We will discuss
this in Chapter 24.

The Self-Propagating Star-Formation Model
Spiral density waves may not be the whole story behind spiral
arms in our Galaxy and other galaxies. The reason is that spiral
density waves should produce very well defined spiral arms. We
do indeed see many so-called grand-design spiral galaxies (Figure
23-25a), with thin, graceful, and well-defined spiral arms. But in
some galaxies, called flocculent spiral galaxies (Figure 23-25b),
the spiral arms are broad, fuzzy, chaotic, and poorly defined.
(“Flocculent” means “resembling wool.”)
To explain such flocculent spirals, M. W. Mueller and
W. David Arnett in 1976 proposed a theory of self-propagating
star formation. Imagine that star formation begins in a dense interstellar cloud within the disk of a galaxy that does not yet have
spiral arms. As soon as hot, massive stars form, their radiation
and stellar winds compress nearby matter, triggering the formation of additional stars in that gas. When massive stars become
supernovae, they produce shock waves that further compress the
surrounding interstellar medium, thus encouraging still more star
formation.
Although all parts of this broad, star-forming region have approximately the same orbital speed about the galaxy’s center, the
inner regions have a shorter distance to travel to complete one orbit than the outer regions. As a result, the inner edges of the starforming region move ahead of the outer edges as the Galaxy
rotates. The bright O and B stars and their nearby glowing nebulae soon become stretched out in the form of a spiral arm. These
spiral arms come and go essentially at random across a galaxy.
Bits and pieces of spiral arms appear where star formation has recently begun but fade and disappear at other locations where all

Variety in Spiral Arms The differences from one spiral galaxy to
another suggest that more than one process can create spiral arms.

Different populations of stars are found in different neighborhoods of
our home galaxy. (The galaxy shown here is another spiral galaxy similar
to our own.) The variations from one galactic region to another are due to
the presence or absence of ongoing star formation.

6. The density waves do not penetrate to the
center of the Galaxy, so new stars are not
presently forming there. The blue O and B stars
have long since died out, so the bulge has a
yellowish color. It contains both old Population I
stars and even older Population II stars (metalpoor stars from the first generation of stars to
form in the Galaxy).

1. All the stars, gas clouds, and
dust particles within the disk
orbit around the center of the
Galaxy. They are held in orbit
by the combined gravitational effects of the other parts
of the Galaxy.

Orbital motion

5. As a star in the disk evolves, it
produces metals. Much of a
star’s metal-enriched material is
returned to the interstellar
medium when it dies. When this
material is next compressed by a
density wave, it is incorporated
into a new generation of stars.
Thus the disk contains many
metal-rich stars of Population I.
Our Sun is one example.

2. Dark dust lanes indicate
where spiral density waves
cause material to pile up as
it orbits the galactic center.
Gas is compressed as it passes through these regions,
triggering the formation of
new stars.

4. Most of the stars produced in
the dust lanes are relatively
faint, with 1 solar mass or less.
These long-lived stars complete
many round trips around the
Galaxy during a main-sequence
lifetime. (Our Sun has made
more than 20 round trips in the
4.56 billion years since it
formed.)

3. Hot, blue, massive O and B stars begin their formation
in the dark dust lanes, then appear fully formed some
distance “downstream” of the dust lanes. These stars
have short main-sequence lifetimes, so they die out
before they travel too far around the disk from their
birthplace.

7. Also orbiting the Galaxy are the
globular clusters. These star clusters
have no mechanism to trigger star
formation, so they contain only very
old, metal-poor Population II stars.
Studies of these clusters suggest
that the first stars formed in them
about 13.6 billion years ago — a mere
100 million years after the Big Bang.

8. Not visible to any telescope is the
Galaxy's dark matter, which emits no
electromagnetic radiation of any kind.
The spherical halo of dark matter that
envelops our Galaxy has at least 10
times the combined mass of all of the
Galaxy's stars, planets, gas, and dust.
Its fundamental nature remains a
mystery.

the massive stars have died off. Self-propagating star formation
therefore tends to produce flocculent spiral galaxies that have a
chaotic appearance with poorly defined spiral arms, like the
galaxy in Figure 23-25b.
The two theories presented here are very different in character. In the density-wave model, star formation is caused by the
spiral arms; in the self-propagating star formation model, by contrast, the spiral arms are caused by star formation. A complete
and correct description of spiral arms in our Galaxy remains a
topic of active research.

23-6 Infrared, radio, and X-ray observations
are used to probe the galactic center
The innermost region of our Galaxy is an active, crowded place.
If you lived on a planet near the galactic center, you could see a

brightest single star in our own night At the very center of the
sky. The total intensity of starlight

In effect, night would never really centered on a
fall on a planet near the center of supermassive black hole
the Milky Way. At the center of this
empire of light, however, lies the darkest of all objects in the
universe—a black hole millions of times more massive than the Sun.

Sagittarius A*: Heart of Darkness
Because of the severe interstellar absorption at visual wavelengths,
most of our information about the galactic center comes from infrared and radio observations. Figure 23-26 shows three infrared
views of the center of our Galaxy. Figure 23-26a is a wide-angle
view covering a 50° segment of the Milky Way from Sagittarius
through Scorpius. (The photograph that opens this chapter shows
this same region at visible wavelengths, viewed at a different angle.) The prominent reddish band through the center of this falsecolor infrared image is a layer of dust in the plane of the Galaxy.
Figure 23-26b is an IRAS view of the galactic center. It is surrounded by numerous streamers of dust (shown in blue). The
strongest infrared emission (shown in white) comes from a grouping of several powerful sources of radio waves. One of these
sources, Sagittarius A* (say “A star”), lies at the very center of
the Galaxy. (Its position, pinpointed with simultaneous observations by radio telescopes scattered around the world, seems to be
very near the gravitational center of the Galaxy.) The highresolution infrared view in Figure 23-26c, made using adaptive
optics (see Section 6-3), shows hundreds of stars crowded within
1 ly (0.3 pc) of Sagittarius A*. Compare this to our region of the
Galaxy, where the average distance between stars is more than a
light-year.
Sagittarius A* itself does not appear in infrared images.
Nonetheless, astronomers have used infrared observations to
make truly startling discoveries about this object. Since the 1990s,

Our Galaxy

Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Garching, Germany, and another led by Andrea Ghez at the University of California, Los Angeles—have been using infrared detectors to
monitor the motions of stars in the immediate vicinity of Sagittarius A*. They have found a number of stars orbiting around
Sagittarius A* at speeds in excess of 1500 km/s (Figure 23-27).
(By comparison, the Earth orbits the Sun at a lackadaisical
30 km/s.) In 2000 the UCLA group observed one such star, called
SO-16, as its elliptical orbit brought it within a mere 45 AU from
Sagittarius A* (11⁄2 times the distance from the Sun to Neptune).
At its closest approach, SO-16 was traveling at a breathtaking
speed of 12,000 km/s, or 4% of the speed of light!
In order to keep stars like SO-16 in such small, rapid orbits,
Sagittarius A* must exert a powerful gravitational force and hence
must be very massive. By applying Newton’s form of Kepler’s
third law to the motions of these stars around Sagittarius A*, the
UCLA group calculates the mass of Sagittarius A* to be a remarkable 3.7 million solar masses (3.7 ⫻ 106 M䉺). Furthermore, the
small separation between SO-16 and Sagittarius A* at closest approach shows that Sagittarius A* can be no more than 45 AU in
radius. An object this massive and this compact can only be one
thing: a supermassive black hole (see Section 22-4).

plosions that may have taken place over the past several thousand
years. Perhaps these past explosions cleared away much of the
material around Sagittarius A*, leaving only small amounts to fall
into the black hole. This could explain why the X-ray flares from
Sagittarius A* are so weak.
LINK 23

.13

There is nonetheless evidence that Sagittarius A* has
been more active in the recent past. Between 2002 and
2005, Michael Muno and his colleagues at Caltech observed that certain nebulae within about 50 ly of Sagittarius A*
suddenly became very bright at X-ray wavelengths. The character
of the X-ray light was such that it could not have originated from
the nebulae themselves. Muno and colleagues concluded that
X-rays emitted from Sagittarius A* about 50 years earlier had
struck and excited the nebulae, causing the nebulae to glow intensely at X-ray wavelengths. To produce such an intense X-ray
glow, an object the size of the planet Mercury must have fallen
into the supermassive black hole.
The supermassive black hole at the center of our Galaxy is
not unique. Observations show that such titanic black holes are
a feature of most large galaxies. In Chapter 25 we will see how
black holes of this kind power quasars, the most luminous sustained light sources in the cosmos.

Evidence in favor of this picture comes from the Chandra X-ray Observatory, which has observed X-ray
flares coming from Sagittarius A*. The flares brighten
dramatically over the space of just 10 minutes, which shows that
the size of the flare’s source can be no larger than the distance
that light travels in 10 minutes. (We used a similar argument in
Section 22-3 to show that the flickering X-ray source Cygnus
X-1 must be very small.) In 10 minutes light travels a distance of
1.8 ⫻ 108 km or 1.2 AU, and only a black hole could pack a mass
of 3.7 ⫻ 106 M䉺 into a volume that size or smaller. The X-ray
flares were presumably emitted by blobs of material that were
compressed and heated as they fell into the black hole (see
Section 22-3).
The X-ray flares from Sagittarius A* are relatively feeble,
which suggests that the supermassive black hole is swallowing
only relatively small amounts of material. But the region around
Sagittarius A* is nonetheless an active and dynamic place. Figure
23-28a is a wide-angle radio image of the galactic center covering an area more than 60 pc (200 ly) across. Huge filaments of
gas stretch for 20 pc (65 ly) northward of the galactic center (to
the right and upward in Figure 23-28a), then abruptly arch southward (down and to the left in the figure). The orderly arrangement of these filaments is reminiscent of prominences on the Sun
(see Section 18-10, especially Figure 18-28). This suggests that, as
on the Sun, there is ionized gas at the galactic center that is being controlled by a powerful magnetic field. Indeed, much of the
radio emission from the galactic center is synchrotron radiation:
As we saw in Section 23-4, such radiation is produced by highenergy electrons spiraling in a magnetic field.
The false-color X-ray image in Figure 23-28b shows the immediate vicinity of Sagittarius A*. The black hole is flanked by
lobes of hot, ionized, X-ray–emitting gas that extend for dozens
of light-years. These are thought to be the relics of immense ex-

Astronomers are still groping for a better understanding of the galactic center. With future developments in
very-long-baseline interferometry (described in Section
6-6), it may be possible to actually obtain a picture of the supermassive black hole lurking there. During the coming years, observations from Earth-orbiting satellites as well as from radio and
infrared telescopes on the ground will certainly add to our knowledge of the core of the Milky Way.

Key Ideas
The Shape and Size of the Galaxy: Our Galaxy has a disk about
50 kpc (160,000 ly) in diameter and about 600 pc (2000 ly) thick,
with a high concentration of interstellar dust and gas in the disk.
• The galactic center is surrounded by a large distribution of stars
called the central bulge. This bulge is not perfectly symmetrical,
but may have a bar or peanut shape.
• The disk of the Galaxy is surrounded by a spherical distribution of globular clusters and old stars, called the galactic halo.
• There are about 200 billion (2 ⫻ 1011) stars in the Galaxy’s
disk, central bulge, and halo.
The Sun’s Location in the Galaxy: Our Sun lies within the galactic disk, some 8000 pc (26,000 ly) from the center of the Galaxy.
• Interstellar dust obscures our view at visible wavelengths along
lines of sight that lie in the plane of the galactic disk. As a result,
the Sun’s location in the Galaxy was unknown for many years.
This dilemma was resolved by observing parts of the Galaxy outside the disk.
• The Sun orbits around the center of the Galaxy at a speed of
about 790,000 km/h. It takes about 220 million years to complete
one orbit.

Our Galaxy

The Rotation of the Galaxy and Dark Matter: From studies of
the rotation of the Galaxy, astronomers estimate that the total
mass of the Galaxy is about 1012 M䉺. Only about 10% of this
mass is in the form of visible stars, gas, and dust. The remaining
90% is in some nonvisible form, called dark matter, that extends
beyond the edge of the luminous material in the Galaxy.

8.

• Our Galaxy’s dark matter may be a combination of MACHOs
(dim, star-sized objects), massive neutrinos, and WIMPs (relatively massive subatomic particles).

10.

The Galaxy’s Spiral Structure: OB associations, H II regions, and
molecular clouds in the galactic disk outline huge spiral arms.

12.

• Spiral arms can be traced from the positions of clouds of atomic
hydrogen. These can be detected throughout the galactic disk by
the 21-cm radio waves emitted by the spin-flip transition in hydrogen. These emissions easily penetrate the intervening interstellar dust.
Theories of Spiral Structure: There are two leading theories of
spiral structure in galaxies.
• According to the density-wave theory, spiral arms are created
by density waves that sweep around the Galaxy. The gravitational
field of this spiral pattern compresses the interstellar clouds
through which it passes, thereby triggering the formation of the
OB associations and H II regions that illuminate the spiral arms.

11.

13.

14.

15.
16.

• According to the theory of self-propagating star formation, spiral arms are caused by the birth of stars over an extended region
in a galaxy. Differential rotation of the galaxy stretches the starforming region into an elongated arch of stars and nebulae.

17.

The Galactic Nucleus: The innermost part of the Galaxy, or galactic nucleus, has been studied through its radio, infrared, and
X-ray emissions (which are able to pass through interstellar dust).

18.

• A strong radio source called Sagittarius A* is located at the
galactic center. This marks the position of a supermassive black
hole with a mass of about 3.7 ⫻ 106 M䉺.

years, this triumph of nineteenth-century engineering was the
largest telescope in the world.
With this new telescope, Rosse examined many of the nebulae that had been discovered and cataloged by William Herschel.
He observed that some of these nebulae have a distinct spiral
structure. One of the best examples is M51, also called NGC
5194. (The “M” designations of galaxies and nebulae come from
a catalog compiled by the French astronomer Charles Messier between 1758 and 1782. The “NGC” designations come from the
much more extensive “New General Catalogue” of galaxies and
nebulae published in 1888 by J. L. E. Dreyer, a Danish astronomer
who lived and worked in Ireland.)
Lacking photographic equipment, Lord Rosse had to make
drawings of what he saw. Figure 24-1b shows a drawing he made
of M51, which compares favorably with modern photographs
(Figure 24-2). Views such as this inspired Lord Rosse to echo
Kant’s proposal that such nebulae are actually “island universes.”
Many astronomers of the nineteenth century disagreed with this
notion of island universes. A consid- As late as the 1920s it

ley was Heber D. Curtis of the University of California’s Lick Observatory. Curtis championed the island universe theory, arguing
that each of these spiral nebulae is a rotating system of stars much
like our own Galaxy.
The Shapley-Curtis “debate” generated much heat but little
light. Nothing was decided, because no one could present conclusive evidence to demonstrate exactly how far away the spiral nebulae are. Astronomy desperately needed a definitive determination
of the distance to a spiral nebula. Such a measurement became
the first great achievement of a young man who studied astronomy at the Yerkes Observatory, near Chicago. His name was
Edwin Hubble.

The astronomical community became increasingly divided over the nature of the spiral nebulae. In April
1920, two opposing ideas were presented before the
National Academy of Sciences in Washington, D.C. On one side
was Harlow Shapley from the Mount Wilson Observatory,
renowned for his recent determination of the size of the Milky
Way Galaxy (see Section 23-1). Shapley thought the spiral nebulae were relatively small, nearby objects scattered around our

After completing his studies, Edwin Hubble joined the staff of the
Mount Wilson Observatory in Pasadena, California. On October 6,
1923, he took a historic photograph of the Andromeda “Nebula,” one of the spiral nebulae around which controversy raged.
(Figure 24-3 is a modern photograph of this object.)
Hubble carefully examined his photographic plate and discovered what he at first thought to
be a nova. Referring to previous Just as RR Lyrae variable

ized that the object was actually a

Cepheid variable star. Further
scrutiny of additional plates over the Cepheid variables
next several months revealed several revealed the immense
more Cepheids. Figure 24-4 shows distances to other
modern observations of a Cepheid galaxies
in another “spiral nebula.”
As we saw in Section 19-6, Cepheid variables help astronomers determine distances. An astronomer begins by carefully measuring the variations in apparent brightness of a Cepheid
variable, then recording the results in the form of a plot of brightness versus time, or light curve (see Figure 19-18a). This graph
gives the variable star’s period and average brightness. Given the
star’s period, the astronomer then uses the period-luminosity relation shown in Figure 19-19 to find the Cepheid’s average luminosity. (The astronomer must also examine the spectrum of the
star to determine whether it is a metal-rich Type I Cepheid or a
metal-poor Type II Cepheid. As Figure 19-19 shows, these have
somewhat different period-luminosity relations.) Knowing both
the apparent brightness and luminosity of the Cepheid, the astronomer can then use the inverse-square law to calculate the distance to the star (see Box 17-2). Box 24-1 presents an example of
how this is done. This procedure is very similar to that used by

Harlow Shapley to measure the distances to the Milky Way’s
globular clusters using RR Lyrae variable stars (see Section 23-1).
Cepheid variables are intrinsically quite luminous, with average luminosities that can exceed 104 L䉺. Hubble realized that

Tools of the Astronomer’s Trade

Cepheids and Supernovae as Indicators of Distance
ecause their periods are directly linked to their luminosities,
Cepheid variables are one of the most reliable tools astronomers have for determining the distances to galaxies. To
this day, astronomers use this link—much as Hubble did back
in the 1920s—to measure intergalactic distances. More recently, they have begun to use Type Ia supernovae, which are
far more luminous and thus can be seen much farther away,
to determine the distances to very remote galaxies.

B

EXAMPLE: In 1992 a team of astronomers observed Cepheid
variables in a galaxy called IC 4182 to deduce this galaxy’s
distance from the Earth. One such Cepheid has a period of
42.0 days and an average apparent magnitude (m) of ⫹22.0.
(See Box 19-3 for an explanation of the apparent magnitude
scale.) By comparison, the dimmest star you can see with the
naked eye has m ⫽ ⫹6; this Cepheid in IC 4182 appears less
than one one-millionth as bright. The star’s spectrum shows
that it is a metal-rich Type I Cepheid variable.
According to the period-luminosity relation shown in
Figure 21-17, such a Type I Cepheid with a period of 42.0
days has an average luminosity of 33,000 L䉺. An equivalent
statement is that this Cepheid has an average absolute magnitude (M) of ⫺6.5. (This compares to M ⫽ ⫹4.8 for the Sun.)
Use this information to determine the distance to IC 4182.

d ⫽ 10(28.5⫹5)/5 parsecs ⫽ 106.7 parsecs ⫽ 5 ⫻ 106 parsecs
(A calculator is needed to calculate the quantity 106.7.)

Review: Our result tells us that the galaxy is 5 million
parcsecs, or 5 Mpc, from Earth (1 Mpc ⫽ 106 pc). This
distance can also be expressed as 16 million light-years.

EXAMPLE: Astronomers are interested in IC 4182 because a
Type Ia supernova was observed there in 1937. All Type Ia
supernovae are exploding white dwarfs that reach nearly the
same maximum brightness at the peak of their outburst (see
Section 22-9). Once astronomers know the peak absolute
magnitude of Type Ia supernovae, they can use these
supernovae as distance indicators. Because the distance to
IC 4182 is known from its Cepheids, the 1937 observations
of the supernova in that galaxy help us calibrate Type Ia
supernovae as distance indicators.
At maximum brightness, the 1937 supernova reached an
apparent magnitude of m ⫽ ⫹8.6. What was its absolute
magnitude at maximum brightness?

Situation: We are given the supernova’s apparent magnitude
m, and we know its distance from the previous example. Our
goal is to calculate its absolute magnitude M.

Situation: We are given the apparent magnitude m ⫽ ⫹22.0

Tools: We again use the relationship m ⫺ M ⫽ 5 log d ⫺ 5.

Tools: We use the relationship between apparent magnitude,
absolute magnitude, and distance given in Box 19-3.

Answer: We could plug in the value of d found in the
previous example. But it is simpler to note that the distance
modulus m ⫺ M has the same value no matter whether it
refers to a Cepheid, a supernova, or any other object, just so
it is at the same distance d. From the Cepheid example we
have m ⫺ M ⫽ 28.5 for IC 4182, so

and the absolute magnitude M ⫽ ⫺6.5 of the Cepheid
variable star in IC 4182. Our goal is to calculate the distance
to this star, and hence the distance to the galaxy of which it
is part.

Answer: In Box 19-3, we saw that the apparent magnitude of
a star is related to its absolute magnitude and distance in
parsecs (d ) by
m ⫺ M ⫽ 5 log d ⫺ 5
This can be rewritten as
d ⫽ 10(m⫺M⫹5)/5 parsecs
We have m ⫺ M ⫽ (⫹22.0) ⫺ (⫺6.5) ⫽ 22.0 ⫹ 6.5 ⫽ 28.5.
(Recall from Box 19-3 that m ⫺ M is called the distance
modulus.) Hence, our equation becomes

photographs of the Andromeda “Nebula,” they must be extremely
far away. Straightforward calculations using modern data reveal that
M31 is some 750 kiloparsecs (2.5 million light-years) from Earth.
Based on its angular size, M31 has a diameter of 70 kiloparsecs—
larger than the diameter of our own Milky Way Galaxy!

M ⫽ m ⫺ (m ⫺ M) ⫽ 8.6 ⫺ (28.5) ⫽ ⫺19.9
This absolute magnitude corresponds to a remarkable peak
luminosity of 1010 L䉺.

Review: Whenever astronomers find a Type Ia supernova in a
remote galaxy, they can combine this absolute magnitude
with the observed maximum apparent magnitude to get the
galaxy’s distance modulus, from which the galaxy’s distance
can be easily calculated (just as we did above for the
Cepheids in IC 4182). This technique has been used to
determine the distances to galaxies hundreds of millions of
parsecs away (see Section 26-4).

These results prove that the Andromeda “Nebula” is actually
an enormous stellar system, far beyond the confines of the Milky
Way. Today, this system is properly called the Andromeda Galaxy.
(Under good observing conditions, you can actually see this galaxy’s
central bulge with the naked eye. If you could see the entire

Galaxies

Andromeda Galaxy, it would cover an area of the sky roughly 5
times as large as the full moon.) Galaxies are so far away that
their distances from us are usually given in millions of parsecs, or
megaparsecs (Mpc): 1 Mpc ⫽ 106 pc. For example, the distance
to the galaxies in the image that opens this chapter is 17 Mpc.
Hubble’s results, which were presented at a meeting of the
American Astronomical Society on December 30, 1924, settled
the Shapley-Curtis “debate” once and for all. The universe was
recognized to be far larger and populated with far bigger objects
than anyone had seriously imagined. Hubble had discovered the
realm of the galaxies.

CAUTION! In everyday language, many people use the words
“galaxy” and “universe” interchangeably. It is true that before
Hubble’s discoveries our Milky Way Galaxy was thought to
constitute essentially the entire universe. But we now know that
the universe contains literally billions of galaxies. A single galaxy,
vast though it may be, is just a tiny part of the entire observable
universe.

Hubble classified galaxies into four broad categories
based on their appearance. These categories form the
basis for the Hubble classification, a scheme that is
still used today. The four classes of galaxies are the spirals, classified S; barred spirals, or SB; ellipticals, E; and irregulars, Irr.
Table 24-1 summarizes some key properties of each class. These
various types of galaxies differ not only in their shapes but also

Spiral Galaxies: Stellar Birthplaces
M51 (Figure 24-2), M31 (Figure 24-3), and M100 (Figure
24-4) are examples of spiral galaxies. Figure 24-5 shows
that spiral galaxies are characterized by arched lanes of

639

stars, just as is our own Milky Way Galaxy (see Section 23-3).
The spiral arms contain young, hot, blue stars and their associated H II regions, indicating ongoing star formation.
Thermonuclear reactions within stars create metals, that is,
elements heavier than hydrogen or helium (see Section 17-5).
These metals are dispersed into space as the stars evolve and die.
So, if new stars are being formed from the interstellar matter in
spiral galaxies, they will incorporate these metals and be Population I stars (see Section 19-5 and Section 23-2). Indeed, the visiblelight spectrum of the disk of a spiral galaxy has strong metal
absorption lines. Such a spectrum is a composite of the spectra of
many stars and shows that the stars in the disk are principally of
Population I. By contrast, there is relatively little star formation
in the central bulges of spiral galaxies, and these regions are dominated by old Population II stars that have a low metal content.
This also explains why the central bulges of spiral galaxies have
a yellowish or reddish color; as a population of stars ages, the
massive, luminous blue stars die off first, leaving only the longerlived, low-mass red stars.
Hubble further classified spiral galaxies according to the texture of the spiral arms and the relative size of the central bulge.
Spirals with smooth, broad spiral arms and a fat central bulge are
called Sa galaxies, for spiral type a (Figure 24-5a); those with
moderately well-defined spiral arms and a moderate-sized central
bulge, like M31 and M51, are Sb galaxies (Figure 24-5b); and
galaxies with narrow, well-defined spiral arms and a tiny central
bulge are Sc galaxies (Figure 24-5c).
The differences between Sa, Sb, and Sc galaxies may be related to the relative amounts of gas and dust they contain. Observations with infrared telescopes (which detect the emission
from interstellar dust) and radio telescopes (which detect radiation from interstellar gases such as hydrogen and carbon monoxide) show that about 4% of the mass of a Sa galaxy is in the form
of gas and dust. This percentage is 8% for Sb galaxies and 25%
for Sc galaxies.
Interstellar gas and dust is the material from which new stars
are formed, so an Sc galaxy has a greater proportion of its mass
involved in star formation than an Sb or Sa galaxy. Hence, a Sc
galaxy has a large disk (where star formation occurs) and a small
central bulge (where there is little or no star formation). By comparison, a Sa galaxy, which has relatively little gas and dust, and

Spiral Galaxies Edwin Hubble classified spiral galaxies according to the
texture of their spiral arms and the relative size of their central bulges.
Sa galaxies have smooth, broad spiral arms and the largest central

thus less material from which to form stars, has a large central
bulge and only a small star-forming disk.

Barred Spiral Galaxies: Spirals with an Extra Twist
In barred spiral galaxies, such as those shown in Figure 24-6, the
spiral arms originate at the ends of a bar-shaped region running
through the galaxy’s nucleus rather than from the nucleus itself.
As with ordinary spirals, Hubble subdivided barred spirals according to the relative size of their central bulge and the character of their spiral arms. A SBa galaxy has a large central bulge
and thin, tightly wound spiral arms (Figure 24-6a). Likewise, a
SBb galaxy is a barred spiral with a moderate central bulge and
moderately wound spiral arms (Figure 24-6b), while a SBc galaxy

central bulges. (a: STScI Digital Sky Survey; b: N. A. Sharp/AURA/NOAO/NSF;

has lumpy, loosely wound spiral arms and a tiny central bulge
(Figure 24-6c). As for ordinary spiral galaxies, the difference between SBa, SBb, and SBc galaxies may be related to the amount
of gas and dust in the galaxy.
Bars appear to form naturally in many spiral galaxies. This
conclusion comes from computer simulations of galaxies, which
set hundreds of thousands of simulated “stars” into orbit around
a common center. As the “stars” orbit and exert gravitational
forces on one another, a bar structure forms in most cases. Indeed, barred spiral galaxies outnumber ordinary spirals by about
two to one. (As we saw in Section 23-2, there is evidence that the
Milky Way Galaxy is a barred spiral.)
Why don’t all spiral galaxies have bars? According to calculations by Jeremiah Ostriker and P. J. E. Peebles of Princeton Uni-

23-4 we saw evidence that our Milky Way Galaxy is surrounded
by such a dark matter halo.) The difference between barred spirals and ordinary spirals may thus lie in the amount of dark matter the galaxy possesses. In Section 24-8 we will see compelling
evidence for the existence of dark matter in spiral galaxies.

in the constellation Virgo. (We will discuss this and other clusters
of galaxies in Section 24-6.)
Giant ellipticals are rather rare, but dwarf elliptical galaxies
are quite common. Dwarf ellipticals are only a fraction the size
of their normal counterparts and contain so few stars—only a few
million, compared to more than 100 billion (1011) stars in our
Milky Way Galaxy—that these galaxies are completely transparent. You can actually see straight through the center of a dwarf
galaxy and out the other side, as Figure 24-9 shows.

Elliptical Galaxies: From Giants to Dwarfs
Elliptical galaxies, so named because of their distinctly elliptical
shapes, have no spiral arms. Hubble subdivided these galaxies according to how round or flattened they look. The roundest elliptical galaxies are called E0 galaxies and the flattest, E7 galaxies.
Elliptical galaxies with intermediate amounts of flattening are
given designations between these extremes (Figure 24-7).

CAUTION! Unlike the designations for spirals and barred spi-

rals, the classifications E0 through E7 may not reflect the true
shape of elliptical galaxies. An E1 or E2 galaxy might actually
be a very flattened disk of stars that we just happen to view
face-on, and a cigar-shaped E7 galaxy might look spherical if
seen end-on. The Hubble scheme classifies galaxies entirely by
how they appear to us on the Earth.

Elliptical galaxies look far less dramatic than their spiral and
barred spiral cousins. The reason, as shown by radio and infrared
observations, is that ellipticals are virtually devoid of interstellar
gas and dust. Consequently, there is little material from which
stars could have recently formed, and indeed there is no evidence
of young stars in most elliptical galaxies. For the most part, star
formation in elliptical galaxies ended long ago. Hence, these
galaxies are composed of old, red, Population II stars with only
small amounts of metals.
Elliptical galaxies come in a wide range of sizes and masses.
Both the largest and the smallest galaxies in the known universe
are elliptical. Figure 24-8 shows two giant elliptical galaxies that
are about 20 times larger than an average galaxy. These giant ellipticals are located near the middle of a large cluster of galaxies

Figure 24-8

the giant elliptical galaxies M84 and M86. These galaxies have angular

Chapter 24

this is not the case at all! For one thing, elliptical galaxies have
little or no overall rotation, while spiral and barred spiral galaxies have a substantial amount of overall rotation. There is no
way that an elliptical galaxy could suddenly start rotating, which
means that it could not evolve into a spiral galaxy.
A more modern interpretation of the Hubble tuning fork diagram is that it is an arrangement of galaxies according to their
overall rotation. A rapidly rotating collection of matter in space
tends to form a disk, while a slowly rotating collection does not.
Thus, the elliptical galaxies at the far left of the tuning fork diagram have little internal rotation and hence no disk. Sa and SBa
galaxies have enough overall rotation to form a disk, though their
central bulges are still dominant. The galaxies with the greatest
amount of overall rotation are Sc and SBc galaxies, in which the
central bulges are small and most of the gas, dust, and stars are
in the disk.

A Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy This diffuse cloud of stars is a nearby E4
dwarf elliptical called Leo I. It actually orbits the Milky Way at a distance
of about 180 kpc (600,000 ly). Leo I is about 1 kpc (3000 ly) in diameter
but contains so few stars that you can see through the galaxy’s center.
(Anglo-Australian Observatory)

The visible light from a galaxy is emitted by its stars, so the
visible-light spectrum of a galaxy has absorption lines. But because a galaxy’s stars are in motion, with some approaching us
and others moving away, the Doppler effect smears out and
broadens the absorption lines. The average motions of stars in a
galaxy can be deduced from the details of this broadening.
For elliptical galaxies, studies of this kind show that star motions are quite random. In a very round (E0) elliptical galaxy, this
randomness is isotropic, meaning “equal in all directions.” Because the stars are whizzing around equally in all directions, the
galaxy is genuinely spherical. In a flattened (E7) elliptical galaxy,
the randomness of the stellar motions is anisotropic, which means
that the range of star speeds is different in different directions.
Hubble also identified galaxies that are midway in appearance between ellipticals and the two kinds of spirals. These are
denoted as S0 and SB0 galaxies, also called lenticular galaxies. Although they look somewhat elliptical, lenticular (“lens-shaped”)
galaxies have both a central bulge and a disk like spiral galaxies,
but no discernible spiral arms. They are therefore sometimes referred to as “armless spirals.” Figure 24-10 shows an example of
an SB0 lenticular galaxy.
Edwin Hubble summarized his classification scheme for spiral, barred spiral, and elliptical galaxies in a diagram, now called
the tuning fork diagram for its shape (Figure 24-11).

CAUTION! When Hubble first drew his tuning fork diagram,
he had the idea that it represented an evolutionary sequence. He
thought that galaxies evolved over time from the left to the right
of the diagram, beginning as ellipticals and eventually becoming
either spiral or barred spiral galaxies. We now understand that

Galaxies that do not fit into the scheme of spirals, barred spirals,
and ellipticals are usually referred to as irregular galaxies. They
are generally rich in interstellar gas and dust, and have both
young and old stars. For lack of any better scheme, the irregular
galaxies are sometimes placed between the ends of the tines of the
Hubble tuning fork diagram, as in Figure 24-11.

Hubble defined two types of irregulars. Irr I galaxies have

the Large Magellanic Cloud (Figure 24-12) and the Small Magellanic Cloud. Both are nearby companions of our Milky Way and
can be seen with the naked eye from southern latitudes. Both
these galaxies contain substantial amounts of interstellar gas.
Tidal forces exerted on these irregular galaxies by the Milky Way
help to compress the gas, which is why both of the Magellanic
Clouds are sites of active star formation.

The other type of irregulars, called Irr II galaxies, have asymmetrical, distorted shapes that seem to have been caused by collisions with other galaxies or by violent activity in their nuclei.

A key question that astronomers ask about galaxies is
“How far away are they?” Unfortunately, many of the
techniques that are used to measure distances within
our Milky Way Galaxy cannot be used for the far greater distances to other galaxies. The extremely accurate parallax method
that we described in Section 17-1 can be used only for stars within
about 500 pc. Beyond that distance, parallax angles become too
small to measure. Spectroscopic parallax, in which the distance to a star

Standard Candles: Variable Stars and
Type Ia Supernovae
To determine the distance to a remote galaxy, astronomers look
instead for a standard candle—an object, such as a star, that lies
within that galaxy and for which we know the luminosity (or,
equivalently, the absolute magnitude, described in Section 17-3).
By measuring how bright the standard candle appears, astronomers can calculate its distance—and hence the distance to
the galaxy of which it is part—using the inverse-square law.

Chapter 24

The challenge is to find standard candles that are luminous
enough to be seen across the tremendous distances to galaxies. To
be useful, standard candles should have four properties:
1. They should be luminous, so we can see them out to great
distances.

3. They should be easily identifiable—for example, by the shape
of the light curve of a variable star.
4. They should be relatively common, so that astronomers can
use them to determine the distances to many different galaxies.
For nearby galaxies, Cepheid variable stars make reliable
standard candles. These variables can be seen out to about
30 Mpc (100 million ly) using the Hubble Space Telescope, and
their luminosity can be determined from their period through the
period-luminosity relation depicted in Figure 19-19. Box 24-1
gives an example of using Cepheid variables to determine distances. RR Lyrae stars, which are Population II variable stars often found in globular clusters, can be used as standard candles in
a similar way. (We saw in Section 25-1 how RR Lyrae variables
helped determine the size of our Galaxy.) Because they are less luminous than Cepheids, RR Lyrae variables can be seen only out
to 100 kpc (300,000 ly).
Beyond about 30 Mpc even the brightest Cepheid variables,
which have luminosities of about 2 ⫻ 104 L䉺, fade from view. As-

BL

INK 2

One class of standard candles that astronomers have
used beyond 30 Mpc is Type Ia supernovae. As we
described in Section 20-9, these occur when a white
dwarf in a close binary system accretes enough matter from its
companion to blow itself apart in a thermonuclear conflagration.
A Type Ia supernova can reach a maximum luminosity of about
3 ⫻ 109 L䉺 (Figure 24-13). If a Type Ia supernova is seen in a
distant galaxy and its maximum apparent brightness measured,
the inverse-square law can be used to find the galaxy’s distance
(see Box 24-1).
One complication is that not all Type Ia supernovae are
equally luminous. Fortunately, there is a simple relationship between the peak luminosity of a Type Ia supernova and the rate at
which the luminosity decreases after the peak: The more slowly
the brightness decreases, the more luminous the supernova. Using
this relationship, astronomers have measured distances to supernovae more than 1000 Mpc (3 billion ly) from Earth.
Unfortunately, this technique can be used only for galaxies in
which we happen to observe a Type Ia supernova. But telescopic
surveys now identify many dozens of these supernovae every year,
so the number of galaxies whose distances can be measured in
this way is continually increasing.
4.8

2. We should be fairly certain about their luminosities, so we
can be equally certain of any distance calculated from a
standard candle’s apparent brightness and luminosity.

tronomers have tried to use even more luminous stars such as
blue supergiants to serve as standard candles. However, this idea
is based on the assumption that there is a fixed upper limit on the
luminosities of stars, which may not be the case. Hence, these
standard candles are not very “standard,” and distances measured
in this way are somewhat uncertain.

distance-measuring techniques used for nearby objects can also
have substantial effects on the distances to remote galaxies. For
instance, if astronomers discovered that the distances to nearby
Cepheids were in error, distance measurements using any technique that is calibrated by Cepheids would be affected as well.

Figure 24-14 shows the ranges of applicability of several important means of determining astronomical distances. Because these
ranges overlap, one technique can be used to calibrate another.
As an example, astronomers have studied Cepheids in nearby
galaxies that have been host to Type Ia supernovae. The Cepheids
provide the distances to these nearby galaxies, making it possible
to determine the peak luminosity of each supernova using its
maximum apparent brightness and the inverse-square law. Once
the peak luminosity is known, it can be used to determine the distance to Type Ia supernovae in more distant galaxies. Because one
measuring technique leads us to the next one like rungs on a ladder, the techniques shown in Figure 24-14 (along with others) are
referred to collectively as the distance ladder.

Other methods for determining the distances to galaxies do not
make use of standard candles. One was discovered in the 1970s
by the astronomers Brent Tully and Richard Fisher. They found
that the width of the hydrogen 21-cm emission line of a spiral
galaxy (see Section 23-3) is related to the galaxy’s luminosity.
This correlation is the Tully-Fisher relation—the broader the line,
the more luminous the galaxy.
Such a relationship exists because radiation from the approaching side of a rotating galaxy is blueshifted while that from
the galaxy’s receding side is redshifted. Thus, the 21-cm line is
Doppler broadened by an amount directly related to how fast a
galaxy is rotating. Rotation speed is related to the galaxy’s mass
by Newton’s form of Kepler’s third law. The more massive a
galaxy, the more stars it contains and thus the more luminous it
is. Consequently, the width of a galaxy’s 21-cm line is directly related to its luminosity.
Because line widths can be measured quite accurately, astronomers can use the Tully-Fisher relation to determine the luminosity of a distant spiral galaxy. By combining this information
with measurements of apparent brightness, they can calculate the
distance to the galaxy. This technique can be used to measure distances of 100 Mpc or more.
Elliptical galaxies do not rotate, so the Tully-Fisher relation
cannot be used to determine their distances. But in 1987 the
American astronomers Marc Davis and George Djorgovski
pointed out a correlation between the size of an elliptical galaxy,
the average motions of its stars, and how the galaxy’s brightness
appears distributed over its surface.
In geometry, three points define a plane, so the relationship
among size, motion, and brightness is called the fundamental
plane. By measuring the last two quantities, an astronomer can

use the fundamental plane relationship to determine a galaxy’s actual size. And by comparing this to the galaxy’s apparent size, the
astronomer can calculate the distance to the galaxy using the
small-angle formula (Box 1-1). Ellipticals can be substantially
larger and more luminous than spirals, so the fundamental plane
can be used at somewhat greater distances than the Tully-Fisher
relation.

Any change in the calculated distance to M100 would change
the calculated luminosity of the Type Ia supernova, and so
would have an effect on all distances derived from observations
of how bright these supernovae appear in other galaxies.) For
this reason, astronomers go to great lengths to check the accuracy and reliability of their standard candles.

The maser technique is still in its infancy. But because it is
independent of all other distance measuring methods, it is likely
to play an important role in calibrating the rungs of the distance
ladder.

24-5 The Hubble law relates the redshifts
of remote galaxies to their distances
from the Earth
Whenever an astronomer finds an object in the sky that can be
seen or photographed, the natural inclination is to attach a spectrograph to a telescope and record the spectrum. As long ago as
1914, Vesto M. Slipher, working at the Lowell Observatory in
Arizona, began taking spectra of “spiral nebulae.” He was surprised to discover that of the 15 spiral nebulae he studied, the
spectral lines of 11 were shifted toward the red end of the spectrum, indicating that they were moving away from the Earth.
This marked dominance of redshifts was presented by Curtis
in the 1920 Shapley-Curtis “debate” as evidence that these spiral
nebulae could not be ordinary nebulae in our Milky Way Galaxy.
It was only later that astronomers realized that the redshifts of
spiral nebulae—that is, galaxies—reveal a basic law of our expanding universe.

Redshift, Distance, and the Hubble Law
LINK 24

One distance-measuring technique that has broken free
of the distance ladder uses observations of molecular
clouds called masers. (“Maser” is an acronym for “microwave amplification by stimulated emission of radiation.”) Just
as an electric current stimulates a laser to emit an intense beam
of visible light, nearby luminous stars can stimulate water molecules in a maser to emit intensely at microwave wavelengths. This
radiation is so intense that masers can be detected millions of parsecs away.
During the 1990s, Jim Herrnstein and his collaborators used
the Very Long Baseline Array (see Section 6-6) to observe a number of masers orbiting in a disk around the center of the spiral
galaxy M106. They determined the orbital speed of the masers
from the Doppler shift of masers near the edges of the disk, where
they are moving most directly toward or away from Earth. They
also measured the apparent change in position of masers moving
across the face of M106. By relating this apparent speed to the
true speed determined from the Doppler shift, they calculated that
the masers and the galaxy of which they are part are 7.2 Mpc
(23 million ly) from Earth (Figure 24-15).

their orbital speed. By relating this to the angle through which the masers
shown in green appear to move in a certain amount of time, we can
calculate the distance to the galaxy.

The more distant a galaxy, the greater its redshift and the
more rapidly it is receding from us.
In other words, nearby galaxies are moving away from us
slowly, and more distant galaxies are rushing away from us much
more rapidly. Figure 24-16 shows this relationship for five representative elliptical galaxies. This universal recessional movement
is referred to as the Hubble flow.
Hubble estimated the distances to a number of galaxies and
the redshifts of those galaxies. The redshift, denoted by the symbol z, is found by taking the wavelength (␭) observed for a given
spectral line, subtracting from it the ordinary, unshifted wavelength of that line (␭0) to get the wavelength difference (⌬␭), and
then dividing that difference by ␭0:

observed from the object
From the redshifts, Hubble used the Doppler formula to calculate the speed at which these galaxies are receding from us. Box
24-2 describes how this is done. Plotting the data on a graph of
distance versus speed, Hubble found that the points lie near a
straight line. Figure 24-17 is a modern version of Hubble’s graph
based on recent data.
This relationship between the distances to galaxies and
their redshifts was one of the most important astronomical discoveries of the twentieth century. As we will see in Chapter 28,
this relationship tells us that we are living in an expanding universe. In 1929, Hubble published this discovery, which is now
known as the Hubble law. The Hubble law is most easily stated
as a formula:

galaxy is related to its distance d from the Earth by
v ⫽ H0d
where H0 is the Hubble constant. We can rewrite this as
v
d⫽ ᎏ
H0
Given the value of H0, we can find the distance d to the galaxy
if we know how to determine the recessional velocity v from
the redshift z.
If the redshift and recessional velocity are not too great,
we can ignore the effects of the special theory of relativity and
use the following equation:
v
z ⫽ ᎏ (valid for low speeds only)
c
where c is the speed of light. For example, a 5% shift in wavelength (z ⫽ 0.05) corresponds to a recessional velocity of 5%
of the speed of light (v ⫽ 0.05c). For redshifts greater than
about 0.1, however, we must use the relativistic equation for
the Doppler shift:

The accompanying graph displays this relationship between redshift z and speed v. Note that z approaches infinity
as v approaches the speed of light.

EXAMPLE: When measured in a laboratory on Earth, the
so-called K line of singly ionized calcium has a wavelength

giant elliptical galaxy NGC 4889, you find this spectral line
at ␭ = 401.8 nm. Using H0 ⫽ 73 km/s/Mpc, find the distance
to this galaxy.

Situation: We are given the values of ␭ and ␭0 for a line in
this galaxy’s spectrum. Our goal is to determine the galaxy’s
distance d.

Tools: We use the relationship z ⫽ (␭ ⫺ ␭0)/␭0 to determine
the redshift. We then use the appropriate formula to
determine the galaxy’s recessional velocity v, and finally use
the Hubble law to determine the distance to the galaxy.
Answer: The redshift of this galaxy is

z ⫽ ᎏᎏᎏ ⫽ 0.0216

This is substantially less than 0.1, so we can safely use the

today left the galaxy 290 million years ago, even before the

EXAMPLE: In late 1997 astronomers observed a Type Ia

supernova (called SN 1997ff) with a redshift z ⫽ 1.7. Use the
Hubble law to find the distance to this supernova.

Situation: We are to use the redshift z to determine the
distance d.
Tools: Since the redshift is large, we use the relativistic
formula relating recessional velocity v and redshift z to
calculate the value of v. We then use the Hubble law to
determine the galaxy’s distance d.

Review: For this supernova the value of z is greater than 1.
Had we used the low-speed relationship z ⫽ v/c, we would
have come to the erroneous conclusion that v ⫽ 1.7c—that
is, that the supernova is receding from us faster than the
speed of light. Using the correct relativistic formula tells us
that the recessional velocity is only 76% of the speed of
light.
In Chapter 26 we will see how observations of very distant supernovae like SN 1997ff reveal important deviations
from the Hubble law. In particular, these observations show
that the expansion of the universe is not proceeding at a constant rate, but is actually accelerating.

CAUTION! A common misconception about the Hubble law is
that all galaxies are moving away from the Milky Way. The reality is that galaxies have their own motions relative to one another, thanks to their mutual gravitational attraction. For nearby
galaxies, the speed of the Hubble flow is small compared to
these intrinsic velocities. Hence, some of the nearest galaxies, including M31 (shown in Figure 24-3), are actually approaching
us and have blueshifts rather than redshifts. But for distant
galaxies, the Hubble speed v ⫽ H0d is much greater than any intrinsic motion that the galaxies might have. Even if the intrinsic
velocity of such a distant galaxy is toward the Milky Way, the
fast-moving Hubble flow sweeps that galaxy away from us.

called the Hubble law.

Pinning Down the Hubble Constant
The exact value of the Hubble constant has been a topic of heated
debate among astronomers for several decades. The problem is
that while redshifts are relatively easy to measure in a reliable
way, distances to galaxies (especially remote galaxies) are not, as
we saw in Section 24-4. Hence, astronomers who use different
methods of determining galactic distances have obtained different

650

values of H0. To see why this is so, it is helpful to rewrite the
Hubble law as

The greater the redshift of a distant galaxy, the greater its
distance.

24-6 Galaxies are grouped into
clusters and superclusters
Galaxies are not scattered randomly throughout the
universe but are found in clusters. Figure 24-18 shows
one such cluster. Like stars within a star cluster, the

This shows that if galaxies of a given recessional velocity (v)
are far away (so d is large), the Hubble constant H0 must be relatively small. But if these galaxies are relatively close (so d is
small), then H0 must have a larger value.
In the past, astronomers who used Type Ia supernovae for
determining galactic distances found galaxies to be farther away
than their colleagues who employed the Tully-Fisher relation.
Therefore, the supernova adherents found values of H0 in the
range from about 40 to 65 km/s/Mpc, while the values from the
Tully-Fisher relation ranged from about 80 to 100 km/s/Mpc.
In the past few years, the Hubble Space Telescope has been
used to observe Cepheid variables with unprecedented precision
and in galaxies as far away as 30 Mpc (100 million ly). These observations and others suggest a value of the Hubble constant of
about 73 km/s/Mpc, with an uncertainty of no more than 10%.
At the same time, reanalysis of the supernova and Tully-Fisher results have brought the values of H0 from these techniques closer
to the Hubble Space Telescope Cepheid value. We will adopt the
value H0 ⫽ 73 km/s/Mpc in this book.
Determining the value of H0 has been an important task of
astronomers for a very simple reason: The Hubble constant is one
of the most important numbers in all astronomy. It expresses the
rate at which the universe is expanding and, as we will see in
Chapter 26, even helps give the age of the universe. Furthermore,
the Hubble law can be used to determine the distances to extremely remote galaxies. If the redshift of a galaxy is known, the
Hubble law can be used to determine its distance from the Earth,
as Box 24-2 shows. Thus, the value of the Hubble constant helps
determine the distances of the most remote objects in the universe
that astronomers can observe.
Because the value of H0 remains somewhat uncertain, astronomers often express the distance to a remote galaxy simply in
terms of its redshift z (which can be measured very accurately).
Given the redshift, the distance to this galaxy can be calculated
from the Hubble law, but the distance obtained in this way will
depend on the particular value of H0 adopted. Rather than going
through these calculations, an astronomer might simply say that
a certain galaxy is “at z ⫽ 0.128.” From the Hubble law relating
redshift and distance, this makes it clear that the galaxy in question is more distant than one at z ⫽ 0.120 but not as distant as
one at z ⫽ 0.130. When astronomers use redshift to describe distance, they are making use of the following general rule:

The Hercules Cluster This irregular cluster of galaxies is

about 200 Mpc (650 million ly) from Earth. The Hercules
cluster contains many spiral galaxies, often associated in pairs and small
groups. (NOAO)

members of a cluster of galaxies are in continual motion around
one another. They appear to be at rest only because they are so
distant from us.

Clusters of Galaxies: Rich and Poor,
Regular and Irregular
A cluster is said to be either poor or rich, depending on how
many galaxies it contains. Poor clusters, which far outnumber
rich ones, are often called groups. For example, the Milky Way
Galaxy, the Andromeda Galaxy (M31), and the Large and Small
Magellanic Clouds belong to a poor cluster familiarly known as
the Local Group. The Local Group contains more than 40 galaxies, most of which are dwarf ellipticals (see Figure 24-9). Figure
24-19 is a map of a portion of the Local Group.
In recent years, astronomers have discovered several previously unknown dwarf elliptical galaxies in the Local Group. As
of this writing (early 2007), the nearest and most recently discovered is the Canis Major Dwarf, so named for the constellation in
whose direction it lies as seen from Earth. It is about 13 kpc
(42,000 ly) from the center of the Milky Way Galaxy and a mere
8 kpc (25,000 ly) from Earth (about the same as the distance from
Earth to the center of the Milky Way). Tidal forces exerted by the
Milky Way on the Canis Major Dwarf are causing this dwarf
galaxy to gradually disintegrate and leave a trail of debris behind
it (Figure 24-20).
We may never know the total number of galaxies in the
Local Group, because dust in the plane of the Milky Way obscures our view over a considerable region of the sky. Nevertheless, we can be certain that no additional large spiral galaxies are
hidden by the Milky Way. Radio astronomers would have detected 21-cm radiation from them, even though their visible light
is completely absorbed by interstellar dust.
The nearest fairly rich cluster is the Virgo cluster, a collection
of more than 2000 galaxies covering a 10° ⫻ 12° area of the sky.
Figure 24-8 shows a portion of this cluster. One member of this

give similar distances to this cluster. The overall diameter of the

positions of the galaxies that comprise the Local Group, a
poor, irregular cluster of which our Galaxy is part. (The blue
rings represent the plane of the Milky Way’s disk; 0° is the
direction from Earth toward the Milky Way’s center. Solid
and dashed lines point to galaxies above and below the
plane, respectively.) The largest and most massive galaxy
in the Local Group is M31, the Andromeda Galaxy; in
second place is the Milky Way, followed by the spiral
galaxy M33. Both the Milky Way and M31 are surrounded
by a number of small satellite galaxies. (© Richard Powell,

Figure 24-8. The diameter of each of these enormous galaxies is
comparable to the 750-kpc distance between the Milky Way and
M31. In other words, one giant elliptical is approximately the
same size as the entire Local Group!
Astronomers also categorize clusters of galaxies as regular or
irregular, depending on the overall shape of the cluster. The Virgo
cluster, for example, is called an irregular cluster, because its
galaxies are scattered throughout a sprawling region of the sky.
Our own Local Group is also an irregular cluster. In contrast, a
regular cluster has a distinctly spherical appearance, with a marked
concentration of galaxies at its center.
The nearest example of a rich, regular cluster is the Coma
cluster, located about 90 Mpc (300 million light-years) from us
toward the constellation Coma Berenices (Berenice’s Hair)
(Figure 24-21). Despite its great distance, telescopic images of this
cluster show more than 1000 galaxies. The Coma cluster almost
certainly contains many thousands of dwarf ellipticals, so the total membership of the cluster may be as many as 10,000 galaxies. The core of the Coma cluster is dominated by two giant
ellipticals surrounded by many normal-sized galaxies.
The overall shape of a cluster is related to the dominant types
of galaxies it contains. Rich, regular clusters contain mostly elliptical and lenticular galaxies. For example, about 80% of the
brightest galaxies in the Coma cluster (see Figure 24-21) are ellipticals; only a few spiral galaxies are scattered around the cluster’s outer regions. Irregular clusters, such as the Virgo cluster
and the Hercules cluster shown in Figure 24-18, have a more even
mixture of galaxy types.

Superclusters: Clusters of Clusters of Galaxies
Clusters of galaxies are themselves grouped together in huge associations called superclusters. A typical supercluster contains
dozens of individual clusters spread over a region of space up to
45 Mpc (150 million ly) across. Figure 24-22 shows the distribution of clusters in our part of the universe. The nearer ones
out to the Virgo cluster, including our own Local Group, are

The most extensive galaxy maps available at this
writing (early 2007) are those from the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey, a joint project of astronomers from the
United States, Japan, and Germany, and from the Two Degree
Field Galactic Redshift Survey (2dFGRS), a collaboration between Australian, British, and U.S. astronomers. (The name refers
to the 2° field of view of the telescope used for the observations,
which is unusually wide for a research telescope.) Figure 24-24a
shows a map made from 2dFGRS measurements of more than
60,000 galaxies. This particular map encompasses two wedgeshaped slices of the universe, one on either side of the plane of
the Milky Way (Figure 24-24b). The Earth (in the Milky Way) is
at the apex of the wedge-shaped map; each dot represents a
galaxy. The measurements used to create this map included galaxies with redshifts as large as z ⫽ 0.25, corresponding to a recessional velocity of 66,000 km/s. With a Hubble constant of 73
km/s/Mpc, this means that the map in Figure 24-24a extends out
to a distance of nearly 1000 Mpc, or 3 billion light-years from
Earth.
Maps such as that shown in Figure 24-24a reveal enormous
voids where exceptionally few galaxies are found. (These voids

The first three-dimensional maps of this kind were made in
the 1970s and included measurements of a few hundred galaxies.

members of the Local Supercluster. The other clusters shown in
Figure 24-22 belong to other superclusters. The most massive
cluster in the local universe is called the Great Attractor; its gravity is so great that the Milky Way as well as the rest of the Local
Supercluster is moving toward it at speeds of several hundred
kilometers per second.
Observations indicate that unlike clusters, superclusters are
not bound together by gravity. That is, most clusters in each supercluster are drifting away from most of the other clusters in that
same supercluster. Furthermore, the superclusters are all moving
away from each other due to the Hubble flow.

Cosmic Voids and Sheets:
The Distribution of Superclusters
Since the 1980s, astronomers have been working to understand
how superclusters are distributed in space. Some of this structure
is revealed by maps such as that shown in Figure 24-23, which
displays the positions on the sky of 1.6 million galaxies. Such
maps reveal that superclusters are not randomly distributed, but
seem to lie along filaments. But to comprehend more fully the distribution of superclusters, it is necessary to map their positions in
three dimensions. This is done by
measuring both the position of a
galaxy on the sky as well as the Superclusters of galaxies

were first discovered in 1978 in a pioneering study by Stephen
Gregory and Laird Thompson at the Kitt Peak National Observatory.) These voids are roughly spherical and measure 30 to
120 Mpc (100 million to 400 million ly) in diameter. They are
not entirely empty, however. There is evidence for hydrogen
clouds in some voids, while others may be subdivided by strings
of dim galaxies.
Figure 24-24a shows that most galaxies are concentrated in
sheets on the surfaces between voids. These sheets can be more
than 100 Mpc long and several megaparsecs thick. This pattern
is similar to that of soapsuds in a kitchen sink, with sheets of soap
film (analogous to galaxies) surrounding air bubbles (analogous
to voids). These titanic sheets of galaxies are the largest structures
known in the universe: On scales much larger than 100 Mpc, the
distribution of galaxies in the universe appears to be roughly uniform. As we will see in Chapter 27, this pattern of sheets and
voids contains important clues about how clusters of galaxies
formed in the early universe.

24-7 Colliding galaxies produce starbursts,
spiral arms, and other spectacular phenomena
Occasionally, two galaxies within a cluster or from adjacent clusters can collide with each other. Past collisions have hurled vast
numbers of stars into intergalactic space. In some cases, we can
even observe a collision in progress, a cosmic catastrophe that
gives birth to new stars. And astronomers can predict collisions
that will not take place for billions of years, such as the collision
that is fated to occur between the galaxy M31 and our own Milky
Way Galaxy.

High-Speed Galaxy Collisions: Shredding Gas and Dust

LINK 24
.15

WEB

When two galaxies collide at high speed, the huge clouds of interstellar gas and dust in the galaxies slam into each other and
can be completely stopped in their tracks. In this way, two colliding galaxies can be stripped of their interstellar gas and dust.

The best evidence that such collisions take place is that many
rich clusters of galaxies are strong sources of X rays (Figure
24-25). This emission reveals the presence of substantial amounts
of hot intracluster gas (that is, gas within the cluster) at temperatures between 107 and 108 K. The only way that such large
amounts of gas could be heated to such extremely high temperatures is in violent collisions between galaxies.

CAUTION! Although galaxies can and do collide, it is highly
unlikely that the stars from two colliding galaxies actually run
into each other. The reason is that the stars within a galaxy are
very widely separated from one another, with a tremendous
amount of space between them.

Gentle Galactic Collisions and Starbursts
In a less violent collision or a near-miss between two galaxies, the
compressed interstellar gas may have more time to cool, allowing
many protostars to form. Such collisions may account for starburst galaxies such as M82 (Figure 24-26), which blaze with the
light of numerous newborn stars. These galaxies have bright centers surrounded by clouds of warm interstellar dust, indicating recent, vigorous star birth. Their warm dust is so abundant that
starburst galaxies are among the most luminous objects in the
universe at infrared wavelengths. (The right-hand image on the
first page of Chapter 6 shows the infrared emission from M82’s
warm dust.)
The starburst galaxy M82 shown in Figure 24-26 also shows
the effects of strong winds from young, luminous stars. It also contains a number of luminous globular clusters. Unlike the globular
clusters in our Galaxy, whose stars are about 12.5 billion years
old, those in M82 are no more than 600 million years old. These
young globular clusters are another sign of recent star formation.
M82 is one member of a nearby cluster of galaxies that includes the beautiful spiral galaxy M81 and a fainter elliptical
companion called NGC 3077 (Figure 24-27a). Radio surveys of
that region of the sky reveal enormous streams of hydrogen gas
connecting the three galaxies (Figure 24-27b). The loops and

When two galaxies merge, the result is a bigger galaxy.
If this new galaxy is located in a rich cluster, it may
capture and devour additional galaxies, growing to
enormous dimensions by galactic cannibalism. Cannibalism differs from mergers in that the galaxy that does the devouring is
bigger than its “meal,” whereas merging galaxies are about the
same size.
Many astronomers suspect that galactic cannibalism is the
reason that giant ellipticals are so huge. As we have seen, giant
galaxies typically occupy the centers of rich clusters. In many cases,
smaller galaxies are located around these giants (see Figure 24-8

Our own Milky Way Galaxy is expected to undergo a
galactic collision like that shown in Figure 24-28. The
Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy, shown in

is only 4.56 billion years old.) When this happens, the sky will
light up with a plethora of newly formed stars, followed in rapid
succession by a string of supernovae, as the most massive of these
stars complete their life spans. Any inhabitants of either galaxy

twists in these streamers suggest that the three galaxies have had
several close encounters over the ages. A similar stream of hydrogen gas connects our Galaxy with its second nearest neighbor, the
Large Magellanic Cloud (see Figure 24-12), suggesting a history
of close encounters between our Galaxy and the LMC.

Although galaxies can collide at very high speeds by Earth standards, they
are so vast that a collision can last hundreds of millions of years.
Understanding what happens during a galactic collision requires ideas
about tidal forces (Chapter 4), star formation (Chapter 18), and stellar
evolution (Chapter 19).
1. One example of a galactic collision is the pair of galaxies
called the Antennae, which lie 19 Mpc (16 million ly) from
Earth in the constellation Corvus (the Crow). They
probably began to interact several hundred million years
ago.

2. As the gas and dust clouds of the two galaxies collide
with each other, they are greatly compressed. This causes
stars to form in tremendous numbers.

Tidal forces between
the galaxies pulled

tails” 200 to 300

Close encounters between galaxies provide a third
way of forming spiral arms (in addition to density
waves and self-propagating star formation, discussed
in Section 23-5). Supercomputer simulations clearly demonstrate
that spiral arms can be created during a collision, either by drawing out long streamers of stars or by compressing clouds of interstellar gas. For example, the spiral arms of M51 (examine Figure
24-2) may have been produced by a close encounter with a second galaxy. The disruptive galaxy, NGC 5195, is now located at
the end of one of the spiral arms created by the collision. The two
galaxies shown in the image that opens this chapter are thought
to be interacting in the same way.
The very fact of our existence may be intimately related to
interactions between galaxies. Some astronomers argue that the
spiral arms of our Milky Way Galaxy were produced by a close
encounter with the Large Magellanic Cloud. As we saw in
Section 23-5, spiral arms compress the interstellar medium in the
Milky Way’s disk to form Population I stars like our own Sun,
which have enough heavy elements to produce Earthlike planets.
Thus, the chain of events that led to the formation of our Sun,
our solar system, and life on our planet may have been initiated
by a long-ago interaction between two galaxies.

The Dark-Matter Problem and Rotation Curves
As for our Galaxy, the problem is to determine what form the invisible mass takes. A partial solution to this dark-matter problem,
which dates from the 1930s, was provided by the discovery in the
late 1970s of hot, X-ray–emitting gas within clusters of galaxies

A cluster of galaxies must be held together by gravity. In other
words, there must be enough matter in the cluster to prevent the
galaxies from wandering away. Nevertheless, careful examination
of a rich cluster, like the Coma cluster shown in Figure 24-21, reveals that the mass of the visually luminous matter (principally
the stars in the galaxies) is not at all sufficient to bind the cluster
gravitationally. The observed line-of-sight speeds of the galaxies,
measured by Doppler shifts, are so large that the cluster should
have broken apart long ago. Considerably more mass than is visible is needed to keep the galaxies bound in orbit about the center of the cluster.
We encountered a similar situation in studying our own Milky
Way Galaxy in Section 25-4: The total mass of our Galaxy is
more than the amount of visible mass. As for our Galaxy, we conclude that clusters of galaxies must contain significant amounts of
nonluminous dark matter. If this dark matter were not there, the
galaxies would have long ago dispersed in random directions and
the cluster would no longer exist today. Analyses demonstrate
that the total mass needed to bind a typical rich cluster is about
10 times greater than the mass of material that shows up on
visible-light images.

(see Figure 24-25a). By measuring
Vast assemblages of dark
the amount of X-ray emission, astronomers find that the total mass of matter reveal their
intracluster gas in a typical rich clus- presence by bending
ter can be greater than the combined passing rays of light
mass of all the stars in all the cluster’s galaxies. This is sufficient to account for only about 10% of
the invisible mass, however. The remainder is dark matter of unknown composition.
Although we do not know what dark matter is made of, it is
possible to investigate how dark matter is distributed in galaxies
and clusters of galaxies. It appears that dark matter lies within
and immediately surrounding galaxies, not in the vast spaces
between galaxies. The evidence for this comes principally from
observations of the rotation curves of galaxies and of the gravitational bending of light by clusters of galaxies.
As we saw in Section 23-4, a rotation curve is a graph that
shows how fast stars in a galaxy are moving at different distances
from that galaxy’s center. For example, Figure 23-18 is the rotation curve for our Galaxy. As Figure 24-29 illustrates, many other
spiral galaxies have similar rotation curves that remain remarkably flat out to surprisingly great distances from each galaxy’s
center. In other words, the orbital speed of the stars remains
roughly constant out to the visible edges of these galaxies.
This observation tells us that we still have not detected the
true edges of these galaxies (and many similar ones). Near the
true edge of a galaxy we should see a decline in orbital speed, in
accordance with Kepler’s third law (see Figure 23-18). Because
this decline has not been observed, astronomers conclude that
there must be a considerable amount of dark material that extends well beyond the visible portion of the disk.

and Figure 24-21). As they pass through the extended halo of a
giant elliptical, these smaller galaxies slow down and are eventually devoured by the larger galaxy.

25

Figure 24-29

The Rotation Curves of Four Spiral Galaxies This graph
shows how the orbital speed of material in the disks of four
spiral galaxies varies with the distance from the center of each galaxy. If
most of each galaxy’s mass were concentrated near its center, these
curves would fall off at large distances. But these and many other
galaxies have flat rotation curves that do not fall off. This indicates the
presence of extended halos of dark matter. (Adapted from V. Rubin and

K. Ford)

Galaxies

“Seeing” Dark Matter with Gravitational Lensing
Further evidence about how dark matter is distributed comes
from the gravitational bending of light rays, which we described
in Section 22-2. As Figure 22-5 shows, the gravity of a single star
like the Sun can deflect light by only a few arcseconds. But a more
massive object such as a galaxy can produce much greater deflections, and the amount of this deflection can be used to determine
the galaxy’s mass. For example, suppose that the Earth, a massive galaxy, and a background light source (such as a more distant galaxy) are in nearly perfect alignment, as sketched in Figure
24-30a. Because of the warped space around the massive galaxy,
light from the background source curves around the galaxy as it
heads toward us. As a result, light rays can travel along two paths
from the background source to us here on the Earth. Thus, we
should see two images of the background source.
A powerful source of gravity that distorts background images
is called a gravitational lens. For gravitational lensing to work,
the alignment between the Earth, the massive galaxy, and a remote background light source must be almost perfect. Without
nearly perfect alignment, the second image of the background star
is too faint to be noticeable.
Beginning in 1979, astronomers have discovered a great number of examples of gravitational lensing. The example shown in

Figure 24-30b is almost exactly like the ideal situation depicted
in Figure 24-30a. If the alignment is very slightly off, the image
of the distant galaxy is distorted into an arc as shown in Figure
24-30c. Figure 24-30d shows a more complicated example of
lensing that results when the gravitational lens is not one but several massive galaxies.
Figure 24-31 shows a situation in which an entire cluster
of galaxies acts as a gravitational lens. The image shows an
ordinary-looking rich cluster of yellowish elliptical and spiral
galaxies, but with a number of curious blue arcs. Reconstruction
of the light paths through the cluster shows that all these blue arcs
are actually distorted images of a single galaxy that lies billions
of light-years beyond the cluster.
By measuring the distortion of the images of such background
galaxies, J. Anthony Tyson of Bell Laboratories and his colleagues
have determined that dark matter, which constitutes about 90%
of the cluster’s mass, is distributed much like the visible matter in
the cluster. In other words, the overall arrangement of visible
galaxies seems to trace the location of dark matter.

The Nature of Dark Matter
Many proposals have been made to explain the nature of dark
matter. One reasonable suggestion was that clusters might contain

a large number of faint, red, low-mass (0.2 M䉺 or less) stars.
These faint stars could be located in extended halos surrounding
individual galaxies or scattered throughout the spaces between
the galaxies of a cluster. They would have escaped detection because their luminosity and hence apparent brightness would be
very low. (The mass-luminosity relation for main-sequence stars,
which we discussed in Section 17-9, tells us that low-mass stars
are intrinsically very faint.) Searches for these stars around other
galaxies as well as around the Milky Way have been carried out
using the Hubble Space Telescope. None has yet been detected,
so it is thought that faint stars are unlikely to constitute the majority of the dark matter in the universe.
As we described in Section 23-4, more exotic dark matter
candidates include massive neutrinos, subatomic particles called
WIMPs (weakly interacting massive particles), and MACHOs
(massive compact halo objects, such as small black holes or brown
dwarfs). To date, however, the true nature of dark matter remains
unknown.
An important clue about the nature of dark matter was discovered in 2006 by examining a rich cluster of galaxies called
1E0657-56. Remarkably, the visible matter and dark matter in
this cluster do not have the same distribution (Figure 24-32a).

determined by gravitational lensing (see Figure 24-30). (b) We can
understand the separation of dark matter and gas in this cluster if we
assume that dark matter does not feel any force of fluid resistance. This
is what we would expect if dark matter responds to gravitational forces
only. (a: X-ray: NASA/CXC/CfA/M. Markevitch et al.; Optical: NASA/STScI;
Magellan/U. Arizona/D. Clew et al.; Lensing Map: NASA/STScI; SO FW;
Magellan/U. Arizona/D. Clowe et al. b: NASA/CXC/M. Weiss)

Galaxies

The best explanation for how this could have come about is that
1E0657-56 is the result of a collision between two galaxy clusters, one larger than the other (Figure 24-32b). (In Section 24-7
we asked you to visualize collisions between entire galaxies; now
you must imagine a vastly more immense collision between entire
clusters of galaxies!) During the collision, the gas from one cluster slams into the gas from the other cluster and slows down due
to fluid resistance. (You feel the force of fluid resistance pushing
against you whenever you try to move through a liquid or gas—
for example, when you swim in a lake or put your hand outside
the window of a fast-moving car.) Fluid resistance is a consequence of the electric forces between adjacent atoms and molecules in a fluid. But if dark matter is made up of some curious
material that responds only to gravitational forces, it is unaffected
by fluid resistance. As a result, during the collision sketched in
Figure 24-32b the gas is slowed by fluid resistance but the dark
matter is not. The agreement of the simulation in Figure 24-32b
with the observations in Figure 24-32a strongly reinforces the
idea that dark matter, though mysterious, is quite real.
The study of dark matter forces us to redefine what we mean
by “ordinary.” As we will see in Chapter 26, we now know that
there is about 5 times as much dark matter in the observable universe as there is visible matter. Because dark matter is so dominant, “ordinary” visible matter—including this book, the air that
you breathe, all the planets and stars, and your own body—is in
fact relatively rare. Thus, “ordinary” matter is rather extraordinary in the universe as a whole.

As we examine galaxies that are at increasing distances from the
Earth, we are actually looking further and further back in time. By
looking into the past, we can see galaxies in their earliest stages.

Building Galaxies from the “Bottom Up”
The Hubble Space Telescope images in Figure 24-33 provide a
glimpse of galaxy formation in the early universe. Figure 24-33a
shows a number of galaxylike objects some 11 billion light-years
(3400 Mpc) away and are thus seen as they were 11 billion years
ago. These objects are smaller than even the smallest galaxies we
see in the present-day universe and have unusual, irregular shapes
(Figure 24-33b). Furthermore, these objects are scattered over an
area only 600 kpc (2 million light-years) across—less than the distance between the Milky Way Galaxy and M31—making it quite
probable that they would collide and merge with each other.
These collisions would be aided by the dark matter associated
with each subgalactic object, which increases the object’s mass

and, hence, the gravitational forces pulling the objects together.
Such mergers would eventually give rise to a normal-sized galaxy.
Images such as those in Figure 24-33 lead astronomers to
conclude that galaxies formed “from the bottom up”—that is, by
the merger of smaller objects like those in Figure 24-33b to form
full-size galaxies. (These same images rule out an older idea that
galaxies formed “from the top down”—that is, directly from immense, galaxy-sized clouds of material.) The blue color of the objects in Figure 24-33b indicates the presence of young stars.
Observations indicate that the very first stars formed about
13.5 billion years ago, when the universe was only about 200 million years old. We will see evidence in Chapter 26 that the matter in the universe formed “clumps” even earlier than this. These
clumps evolved into objects like those shown in Figure 24-33b,
which in turn merged to form the population of galaxies that we
see today.

Forming Spirals, Lenticulars, and Ellipticals
Once a number of subgalactic units combine, they make an object called a protogalaxy. The rate at which stars form within a
protogalaxy may determine whether this protogalaxy becomes a
spiral or an elliptical. If stars form relatively slowly, the gas surrounding them has enough time to settle by collisions to form a
flattened disk, much as happened on a much smaller scale in the
solar nebula (see Section 8-4). Star formation continues because
the disk contains an ample amount of hydrogen from which to
make new stars. The result is a spiral or lenticular galaxy (Figure
24-34a). But if stars initially form in the protogalaxy at a rapid
rate, virtually all of the available gas is used up to make stars be-

fore a disk can form. In this case what results is an elliptical
galaxy (Figure 24-34b).
Figure 24-34c compares the stellar birthrate in the two types
of galaxies. This graph helps us understand some of the differences between spiral and elliptical galaxies that we described in
Section 24-3. Protogalaxies are thought to have been composed
almost exclusively of hydrogen and helium gas, so the first stars
were Population II stars with hardly any metals (that is, heavy elements). As stars die and form planetary nebulae or supernovae,
they eject gases enriched in metals into the interstellar medium. In
a spiral galaxy there is ongoing star formation in the disk, so
these metals are incorporated into new generations of stars, making relatively metal-rich Population I stars like the Sun. By contrast, an elliptical galaxy has a single flurry of star formation
when it is young, after which star formation ceases. Elliptical
galaxies therefore contain only metal-poor Population II stars.
Figure 24-34c shows that both elliptical and spiral galaxies
form stars most rapidly when they are young. This idea is borne
out by the observation that very distant galaxies tend to be blue,
which means that galaxies were bluer in the distant past than they
are today. (Note the very blue colors of the distant, gravitationally lensed galaxies shown in Figure 24-30 and Figure 24-31, as
well as those of the subgalactic objects shown in Figure 24-33b.)
Spectroscopic studies of such galaxies in the 1980s by James
Gunn and Alan Dressler demonstrated that most owe their blue
color to vigorous star formation, often occurring in intense,
episodic bursts. The hot, luminous, and short-lived O and B stars
produced in these bursts of star formation give blue galaxies their
characteristic color.

and elliptical galaxies.

Galaxies

An Evolving Universe of Galaxies
In addition to changes in galaxy colors, the character of the galactic population has also changed over the past several billion years.
In nearby rich clusters, only about 5% of the galaxies are spirals.
But observations of rich clusters at a redshift of z ⫽ 0.4—which
corresponds to looking about 4 billion years into the past—show
that about 30% of their galaxies were spirals.
Why were spiral galaxies more common in rich clusters in the
distant past? Galactic collisions and mergers are probably responsible. During a collision, interstellar gas in the colliding galaxies
is vigorously compressed, triggering a burst of star formation (see
the Cosmic Connections figure in Section 24-7). A succession of
collisions produces a series of star-forming episodes that create
numerous bright, hot O and B stars that become dispersed along
arching spiral arms by the galaxy’s rotation. Eventually, however,
the gas is used up; star formation then ceases and the spiral arms
become less visible. Furthermore, tidal forces tend to disrupt colliding galaxies, strewing their stars across intergalactic space until the galaxies are completely disrupted (see Figure 24-28).
A full description of galaxy formation and evolution must include the effects of dark matter. As we have seen, only about 10%
of the mass of a galaxy—its stars, gas, and dust—emits electromagnetic radiation of any kind. As yet we have no idea what the
remaining 90% looks like or what it is made of. The dilemma of
dark matter is one of the most challenging problems facing astronomers today.

The Hubble Classification: Galaxies can be grouped
into four major categories: spirals, barred spirals, ellipticals, and irregulars.

• The disks of spiral and barred spiral galaxies are sites of active
star formation.
• Elliptical galaxies are nearly devoid of interstellar gas and dust,
and so star formation is severely inhibited.

663

• Lenticular galaxies are intermediate between spiral and elliptical galaxies.
• Irregular galaxies have ill-defined, asymmetrical shapes. They
are often found associated with other galaxies.
Distance to Galaxies: Standard candles, such as Cepheid variables
and the most luminous supergiants, globular clusters, H II regions, and supernovae in a galaxy, are used in estimating intergalactic distances.
• The Tully-Fisher relation, which correlates the width of the
21-cm line of hydrogen in a spiral galaxy with its luminosity, can
also be used for determining distance. A method that can be used
for elliptical galaxies is the fundamental plane, which relates the
galaxy’s size to its surface brightness distribution and to the motions of its stars.
The Hubble Law: There is a simple linear relationship between
the distance from the Earth to a remote galaxy and the redshift
of that galaxy (which is a measure of the speed with which it is
receding from us). This relationship is the Hubble law, v ⫽ H0d.
• The value of the Hubble constant, H0, is not known with certainty but is close to 73 km/s/Mpc.
Clusters and Superclusters: Galaxies are grouped into clusters
rather than being scattered randomly throughout the universe.
• A rich cluster contains hundreds or even thousands of galaxies;
a poor cluster, often called a group, may contain only a few
dozen.
• A regular cluster has a nearly spherical shape with a central concentration of galaxies; in an irregular cluster, galaxies are distributed asymmetrically.
• Our Galaxy is a member of a poor, irregular cluster called the
Local Group.
• Rich, regular clusters contain mostly elliptical and lenticular
galaxies; irregular clusters contain spiral, barred spiral, and irregular galaxies along with ellipticals.
• Giant elliptical galaxies are often found near the centers of rich
clusters.
Galactic Collisions and Mergers: When two galaxies collide, their
stars pass each other, but their interstellar media collide violently,
either stripping the gas and dust from the galaxies or triggering
prolific star formation.
• The gravitational effects during a galactic collision can throw
stars out of their galaxies into intergalactic space.
• Galactic mergers may occur; a large galaxy in a rich cluster may
tend to grow steadily through galactic cannibalism, perhaps producing in the process a giant elliptical galaxy.
The Dark-Matter Problem: The luminous mass of a cluster of
galaxies is not large enough to account for the observed motions
of the galaxies; a large amount of unobserved mass must also be
present. This situation is called the dark-matter problem.
• Hot intergalactic gases in rich clusters account for a small part
of the unobserved mass. These gases are detected by their X-ray
emission. The remaining unobserved mass is probably in the form
of dark-matter halos that surround the galaxies in these clusters.

664

Chapter 24

• Gravitational lensing of remote galaxies by a foreground cluster enables astronomers to glean information about the distribution of dark matter in the foreground cluster.
Formation and Evolution of Galaxies: Observations indicate that
galaxies arose from mergers of several smaller gas clouds.
• Whether a protogalaxy evolves into a spiral galaxy or an elliptical galaxy depends on its initial rate of star formation.

Advanced Questions
Questions preceded by an asterisk (*) involve topics discussed
in the Boxes.

Problem-solving tips and tools
Box 1-1 explains the small-angle formula, and Box 17-3 discusses the relationship among apparent magnitude, absolute
magnitude, and distance. As Box 23-2 explains, a useful form
of Kepler’s third law is M ⫽ rv 2/G, where M is the mass
within an orbit of radius r, v is the orbital speed, and G is
the gravitational constant. Another form of Kepler’s third
law, particularly useful for two stars or two galaxies orbiting
each other, is given in Section 17-9. The volume of a sphere
of radius r is 4␲r3/3. The mass of a hydrogen atom (1H) is
given in Appendix 7.

31. Hubble made his observations of Cepheids in M31 using the
100-inch (2.5-meter) telescope on Mount Wilson. Completed
in 1917, this was the largest telescope in the world when
Hubble carried out his observations in 1923. Why was it
helpful to use such a large telescope?
32. The image on page 665 shows the Small Magellanic Cloud
(SMC), an irregular galaxy that orbits the Milky Way. The
SMC is 63 kpc (200,000 ly) from Earth and 8 kpc (26,000 ly)
across, and can be seen with the naked eye from southern latitudes. What features of this image indicate that there has
been recent star formation in the SMC? Explain.

33. When the results from the Hipparcos mission were released,
with new and improved measurements of the parallaxes of
nearby stars within 500 pc, astronomers had to revise the distances to many remote galaxies millions of parsecs away. Explain why.
34. As Figure 19-19 shows, there are two types of Cepheid variables. Type I Cepheids are metal-rich stars of Population I,
while Type II Cepheids are metal-poor stars of Population II.
(a) Which type of Cepheid variables would you expect to be
found in globular clusters? Which type would you expect to
be found in the disk of a spiral galaxy? Explain your reasoning. (b) When Hubble discovered Cepheid variables in M31,
the distinction between Type I and Type II Cepheids was not
yet known. Hence, Hubble thought that the Cepheids seen in
the disk of M31 were identical to those seen in globular clusters in our own Galaxy. As a result, his calculations of the
distance to M31 were in error. Using Figure 19-19, explain
whether Hubble’s calculated distance was too small or too
large.
*35. Astronomers often state the distance to a remote galaxy in
terms of its distance modulus, which is the difference between
the apparent magnitude m and the absolute magnitude M
(see Box 17-3). (a) By measuring the brightness of supernova
1994I in the galaxy M51 (see Figure 24-2), the distance modulus for this galaxy was determined to be m ⫺ M ⫽ 29.2.
Find the distance to M51 in megaparsecs (Mpc). (b) A separate distance determination, which involved measuring the
brightnesses of planetary nebulae in M51, found m ⫺ M ⫽
29.6. What is the distance to M51 that you calculate from
this information? (c) What is the difference between your answers to parts (a) and (b)? Compare this difference with the
750-kpc distance from the Earth to M31, the Andromeda
Galaxy. The difference between your answers illustrates the
uncertainties involved in determining the distances to galaxies!

At maximum brilliance, the supernova reaches an apparent
magnitude of ⫹10. How far away is the galaxy? (Hint: See
Box 24-1.)

37. The masers that orbit the center of the spiral galaxy M106
travel at an orbital speed of about 1000 km/s. Astronomers
observed these masers at intervals of 4 months. (a) What distance does a single maser move during a 4-month period?
Give your answer in kilometers and in AU. (b) During this
period, a maser moving across the line of sight (like the maser
shown in green in Figure 24-15) appeared to move through
an angle of only 10–5 arcsec. Calculate the distance to the
galaxy.
38. The average radial velocity of galaxies in the Hercules cluster pictured in Figure 24-18 is 10,800 km/s. (a) Using
H0 ⫽ 73 km/s/Mpc, find the distance to this cluster. Give
your answer in megaparsecs and in light-years. (b) How
would your answer to (a) differ if the Hubble constant had a
smaller value? A larger value? Explain.
39. A certain galaxy is observed to be receding from the Sun at
a rate of 7500 km/s. The distance to this galaxy is measured
independently and found to be 1.4 ⫻ 108 pc. From these
data, what is the value of the Hubble constant?
*40. In the spectrum of the galaxy NGC 4839, the K line of singly
ionized calcium has a wavelength 403.2 nm. (a) What is the
redshift of this galaxy? (Hint: See Box 24-2.) (b) Determine
the distance to this galaxy using the Hubble law with
H0 ⫽ 73 km/s/Mpc.
*41. The galaxy RD1 has a redshift of z ⫽ 5.34. (a) Determine its
recessional velocity v in km/s and as a fraction of the speed
of light. (b) What recessional velocity would you have calculated if you had erroneously used the low-speed formula relating z and v? Would using this formula have been a small
or large error? (c) According to the Hubble law, what is the
distance from Earth to RD1? Use H0 ⫽ 73 km/s/Mpc for the
Hubble constant, and give your answer in both megaparsecs
and light-years.
42. It is estimated that the Coma cluster (see Figure 24-21) contains about 1013 M䉺 of intracluster gas. (a) Assuming that
this gas is made of hydrogen atoms, calculate the total number of intracluster gas atoms in the Coma cluster. (b) The
Coma cluster is roughly spherical in shape, with a radius of
about 3 Mpc. Calculate the number of intracluster gas atoms
per cubic centimeter in the Coma cluster. Assume that the gas
fills the cluster uniformly. (c) Compare the intracluster gas in
the Coma cluster with the gas in our atmosphere (3 ⫻ 1019
molecules per cubic centimeter, temperature 300 K); a typical gas cloud within our own Galaxy (a few hundred molecules per cubic centimeter, temperature 50 K or less); and the
corona of the Sun (105 atoms per cubic centimeter, temperature 106 K).
*43. Two galaxies separated by 600 kpc are orbiting each other
with a period of 40 billion years. What is the total mass of
the two galaxies?

NGC 4378. Using data from that graph, calculate the orbital
period of stars 20 kpc from the galaxy’s center. How much
mass lies within 20 kpc from the center of NGC 4378?

Many of the most revolutionary discoveries in astronomy have

Galileo used a new device called the telescope to scan the sky, and
in the process found evidence that shattered the ancient geocentric model of the universe (see Section 4-3). And so it was during
the middle years of the twentieth century, when the new technique of radio astronomy revealed the existence of remote, dazzlingly luminous objects called quasi-stellar radio sources or

n ordinary star emits radiation primarily at ultraviolet, visible, and infrared wavelengths, in proportions that reflect the star’s surface temperature. Ordinary
galaxies, too, emit most strongly in these wavelength regions. But
the object shown here, called 3C 273, is outrageously different: It
emits strongly over an immense range of wavelengths from radio
to X-ray. 3C 273 is also intensely luminous, with thousands of
times the radiation output of an ordinary galaxy. And, as this
X-ray image shows, some source of energy within 3C 273 causes
it to eject a glowing, high-speed jet that extends outward for hundreds of thousands of light-years.
3C 273 is a quasar—one of many thousands of distant objects whose luminosity is far too great to come from starlight
alone. Quasars are intimately related to active galaxies, whose
tremendous luminosity can fluctuate substantially over a period
of months, weeks, or even days.
What makes quasars and active galaxies so tremendously energetic? The quest to answer this question was one of the greatest scientific detective stories of the twentieth century. Like a
detective story, in this chapter we will begin with the often startling evidence about quasars and active galaxies that confronted
astronomers. The plot will thicken as we reveal the prime
suspects—supermassive black holes that are thought to lie at the
center of every quasar and active galaxy. As matter accretes onto
such a black hole, it releases fantastic amounts of energy and can
produce powerful jets. We will even catch the culprit in the act,
with an image that shows a quasar about to devour material to
feed its central black hole.

Radio-emitting lobes

Cygnus A (3C 405) (a) This false-color radio image from
the Very Large Array shows that most of the emission
from Cygnus A comes from luminous radio lobes located
on either side of a peculiar galaxy. (Red indicates the
strongest radio emission, while blue indicates the
faintest). Each lobe extends about 70 kpc (230,000 ly)
from the galaxy. (b) The galaxy at the heart of Cygnus A
has a substantial redshift, so it must be extremely far
from Earth (about 230 Mpc, or 740 million ly). To be so
distant and yet be one of the brightest radio sources in
the sky, Cygnus A must have an enormous energy output.

third source, called Cygnus A (Figure 25-1a), proved more elusive. The mystery only deepened in 1951, when Walter Baade and
Rudolph Minkowski used the 200-inch (5-meter) optical telescope on Palomar Mountain to discover a dim, strange-looking
galaxy at the position of Cygnus A (see Figure 25-1b).
When Baade and Minkowski photographed the spectrum of
Cygnus A, they were surprised to find a number of bright emission lines. By contrast, a normal galaxy has absorption lines in its
spectrum (see Section 24-3 and Figure 24-16). This absorption
takes place in the atmospheres of the stars that make up the
galaxy, as we described in Section 17-5. In order for Cygnus A to
have emission lines, something must be exciting and ionizing its
atoms. Furthermore, the wavelengths of Cygnus A’s emission
lines are all shifted by 5.6% toward the red end of the spectrum.
Astronomers use the letter z to denote redshift (see Section 24-5),
and thus this object has z ⫽ 0.056, corresponding to a recessional
velocity of 16,000 km/s.
If Cygnus A participates in the same Hubble flow as clusters
of galaxies (described in Section 24-5), then this recessional velocity corresponds to a tremendous distance from the Earth—
about 230 Mpc (740 million ly) if the Hubble constant equals
73 km/s/Mpc. Yet despite its tremendous distance from the Earth,
radio waves from Cygnus A can be picked up by amateur astronomers with backyard equipment. This means that Cygnus A
must be one of the most luminous radio sources in the sky. In
fact, its radio luminosity is 107 times as great as that of an ordinary galaxy like the Milky Way. The object that creates the
Cygnus A radio emission must be something quite extraordinary.
Cygnus A was not the only curious radio source to draw the
attention of astronomers. In 1960, Allan Sandage used the
200-inch telescope to discover a “star” at the location of a radio
source designated 3C 48 (Figure 25-2). (The “3C” refers to the
Third Cambridge Catalogue, a compendium of radio sources.)
Ordinary stars are not strong sources of radio emission, so 3C 48
must be something unusual. Like Cygnus A, its spectrum showed

(b) Visible-light closeup of the central

a series of emission lines, but astronomers were unable to identify the chemical elements that produced these lines.
Two years later, astronomers discovered a similar starlike optical counterpart to the radio source 3C 273. This “star” is even

The Quasar 3C 48 This object in the constellation Triangulum was
thought at first to be a nearby star that happened to emit radio waves. In
fact, the redshift of 3C 48 is so great (z ⫽ 0.367) that, according to the
Hubble law, it must presently be approximately 1400 Mpc (4.6 billion ly)
away. (Alex G. Smith, Rosemary Hill Observatory, University of Florida)

Quasars and Active Galaxies

Emission lines are caused by excited atoms, which emit radiation
at specific wavelengths.
Upon learning how Schmidt deciphered the spectrum of
3C 273, two other Caltech astronomers, Jesse Greenstein and
Thomas Matthews, found they could identify the spectral lines of
3C 48 as having suffered an even larger redshift of z ⫽ 0.367.
That shift corresponds to a speed three-tenths that of light, which
means that 3C 48 is presently twice as far away as 3C 273, or
approximately 1400 Mpc (4.6 billion ly) from Earth.

Quasars: High Redshifts, Extreme Distances
BL

Because of their strong radio emission and starlike appearance, 3C 48 and 3C 273 were dubbed quasistellar radio sources, a term soon shortened to quasars.
After the first quasars were discovered by their radio emission,
many similar, high-redshift, starlike objects were found that emit
little or no radio radiation. These “radio-quiet” quasars were
originally called quasi-stellar objects, or QSOs, to distinguish
them from radio emitters. Today, however, the term “quasar” is
often used to include both types. Only about 10% of quasars are
“radio-loud” like 3C 48 and 3C 273.
Thanks to sky surveys like those we discussed in Section
24-6, more than 100,000 quasars are now known. They all look
rather like stars (see Figure 1-10), and all have large redshifts,
ranging from 0.06 to at least 5.8 (Figure 25-4). Most quasars
have redshifts of 0.3 or more, which implies that they are more

15.8% greater than for a sample of hydrogen on Earth. For example, the
wavelength of H␤ is shifted from 486 nm (a blue-green wavelength) to

more unusual, with a luminous jet protruding from one side. (The
image that opens this chapter shows 3C 273 and its accompanying jet.) Like 3C 48, its visible spectrum contains a series of emission lines that no one could explain.

This quasar has such a large redshift
(z = 3.773) that these ultraviolet
hydrogen emission lines have been
shifted to visible wavelengths.
Lα

Although 3C 48 and 3C 273 were clearly oddballs, many astronomers thought they were just strange stars in our own Galaxy.
A breakthrough occurred in 1963, when Maarten Schmidt at Caltech took another look at the spectrum of 3C 273. He realized
that four of its brightest emission lines are positioned relative to
one another in precisely the same way as four of the Balmer lines
of hydrogen. However, these emission lines from 3C 273 were all
shifted to much longer wavelengths than the usual wavelengths of
the Balmer lines. Schmidt determined that 3C 273 has a redshift of
z ⫽ 0.158, corresponding to a recessional velocity of 44,000 km/s
(15% of the speed of light). No star could be moving this fast
and remain within our Galaxy. Hence, Schmidt concluded that
3C 273 could not be a nearby star, but must lie outside the Milky
Way.
According to the Hubble law, the recessional velocity of
3C 273 implies that its present distance from us is 630 Mpc
(2 billion ly). To be detected at such distances, 3C 273 must be
an extraordinarily powerful source of both visible light and radio
radiation.
Figure 25-3 shows the visible and near-infrared spectrum of
3C 273. As we saw in Section 6-5 (review Figure 6-21), such a
spectrum is a graph of intensity versus wavelength on which emission lines appear as peaks and absorption lines appear as valleys.

wavelengths, have been shifted into the visible part of the spectrum. The

and to the Parkes Observatory in Australia, where it was first discovered

than 1000 Mpc (3 billion light-years) from Earth. For example,
the quasar PC 1247⫹3406 has a redshift of z ⫽ 4.897, which
corresponds to a recessional velocity of more than 94% of the
speed of light and (from the Hubble law) a distance of roughly
7950 Mpc (25.9 billion ly) from Earth.

CAUTION! A value of z greater than 1 does not mean that a
quasar is receding from us faster than the speed of light. At high
speeds, the relationship between redshift and recessional velocity must be modified by the special theory of relativity, as explained in Box 24-2. As the speed of a receding source
approaches the speed of light, its redshift can become very much
greater than 1. An infinite redshift (z ⫽ ⬁) corresponds to a recessional velocity equal to the speed of light.
Light takes time to travel across space, so when we observe
a very remote object, we are seeing it in the remote past. This
means that for very remote objects, the relationship between redshift and distance from the Earth depends on how the universe
has evolved over time. As we will see in Chapter 26, the Hubble
law reveals that the universe is expanding. In other words, if you
could watch the motions of widely separated clusters of galaxies
over millions of years, you would see them gradually moving
away from one another. Furthermore, in Chapter 26 we will see
evidence that the universe has expanded at different rates at different times in the past. Table 25-1 relates the redshift to the re-

CAUTION! Since the universe is expanding, there is more than
one way to state the distance between us and a distant quasar.
The light from quasar PC 1247⫹3406 has taken 12.5 billion
years to reach us, so we see this quasar as it was 12.5 billion
years ago. This elapsed time is called the light travel time. But
the universe has continued to expand during that time. Hence,
PC 1247⫹3406 is now much more than 12.5 billion light-years
away, about 25.9 billion ly or 7950 Mpc. This is called the comoving radial distance to the quasar, and is actually the correct
distance d to use in the Hubble law v ⫽ H0d. (The distances we
cited above for Cygnus A, 3C 273, 3C 48, and PKS 1247⫹3406
are all comoving radial distances.) From this point forward,
when we give the distance to a remote galaxy or quasar, we
mean the light travel time multiplied by the speed of light—that
is, the distance that light traveled to reach us from that galaxy
or quasar. Then the distance to a remote object expressed in
light-years tells you how many years into the past you are looking when you view that object. (Table 25-1 lists both the distance calculated in this way and the comoving radial distance.)
To avoid these issues about how best to define distances, many
astronomers prefer simply to state the redshift z of a distant object; they then use the simple rule that the greater the redshift,
the more distant the object (see Section 24-5).

Figure 25-5
Quasars Are Extinct The greater the redshift of a quasar, the farther it
is from Earth and the farther back in time we are seeing it. By observing
the number of quasars found at different redshifts, astronomers can
calculate how the density of quasars in the universe has changed over
the history of the universe. The history of quasars is reminiscent of the
history of the dinosaurs, which once populated the entire Earth but today
are extinct. (Peter Shaver, European Southern Observatory)

Because there are no quasars with small redshifts, it follows
that there are no nearby quasars. The nearest one is some
250 Mpc (800 million ly) from the Earth. Hence, the absence
of nearby quasars means that there have been no quasars for
800 million years. Indeed, the number of quasars began to decline
precipitously roughly 10 billion years ago (Figure 25-5). Quasars
were a common feature of the universe in the distant past, but
there are none in the present-day universe.

25-2 Quasars are the ultraluminous centers
of distant galaxies
If quasars are as distant as their redshifts show them to be, they
must be extraordinarily luminous to be visible from Earth. What,
then, are these strange objects? Quasars cannot simply be very
large and luminous galaxies, because their spectra are totally different: The visible-light and infrared spectrum of a galaxy is dominated by absorption lines from the galaxy’s stars, while the
corresponding spectrum of a quasar is dominated by emission
lines. Quasars also emit much more of their light at ultraviolet
wavelengths than do stars or galaxies. Hence, whatever the origin of a quasar’s radiation, it is not simply starlight. While quasars
are not galaxies, we will see compelling evidence that the two are
intimately related: Quasars turn out to be ultraluminous objects
located at the centers of remote galaxies.

BL

INK 2

When quasars were first discovered, their energy output seemed so absurdly huge that a few astronomers
began to question long-held ideas, such as the Hubble
law. Traditionally, astronomers had used the Hubble law to calculate the distance to a galaxy from its redshift: the higher the
redshift, the greater the distance. In the 1960s the American astronomer Halton C. Arp suggested that the Hubble law might not
apply to quasars. If part of a quasar’s redshift was caused by
some yet-undiscovered phenomenon, then the quasar could be
much closer to Earth than the Hubble law would have us believe.
If so, a quasar’s luminosity would not be so incredibly large.
In support of this theory, Arp and his collaborators drew attention to certain high-redshift quasars that seem to be located in
or associated with low-redshift galaxies. These examples of “discordant redshifts” fueled a heated debate during the 1970s that
was reminiscent of the Shapley-Curtis “debate” 50 years earlier
(see Section 24-1). By the 1980s, however, the preponderance of
evidence clearly favored the standard interpretation of redshifts
according to the Hubble law. Most astronomers today regard
Arp’s discordant redshifts as simply a projection effect, whereby
a distant quasar just happens to be in the same part of the sky as
a nearby galaxy.

A quasar’s luminosity can be calculated from its apparent brightness and distance using the inverse-square law (see Section 17-2).
For example, 3C 273 has a luminosity of about 1040 watts, which
is equivalent to 2.5 ⫻ 1013 (25 trillion) Suns. (The Sun’s luminosity is The most luminous

quasars emit 100,000

cal large galaxy, like our own Milky Way Galaxy
Way, shines with a luminosity of
1037 watts, which equals 2.5 ⫻ 1010 (25 billion) Suns. Thus, a
bright quasar can be many thousands of times more luminous
than the entire Milky Way Galaxy.

ANALOGY An analogy to the projection effect sometimes happens in photography on Earth. If a photographer poses a person
with a telephone pole in the background, the photo can give the
misleading impression that the unlucky person has a telephone
pole growing out of his head.
What largely ended the redshift debate of the 1970s were observations showing that quasars are associated with remote galaxies. Long-exposure images of quasars showed that they are often
found in groups or clusters of galaxies, and that the redshift of
each of these quasars is essentially the same as the redshifts of the
galaxies that surround it. Thus, the quasar’s redshift indicates its
distance from Earth, just as do the redshifts of galaxies.

Quasar “Fuzz” and Host Galaxies

lines, indicating that each of these quasars is embedded in a galaxy
whose light is far fainter than that of the quasar itself. In each

case, the absorption lines of the stars have the same redshift as
the quasar’s emission lines, further supporting the idea that
quasars are at distances indicated by their redshifts and the
Hubble law.

Quasars and Active Galaxies

It is very difficult to observe the “host galaxy” in which a
quasar is located because the quasar’s light overwhelms light from
the galaxy’s stars (Figure 25-6a). Nevertheless, improved technology and painstaking observations have revealed some basic properties of these host galaxies (Figure 25-6b). Relatively nearby
radio-quiet quasars (with redshifts of less than 0.2, corresponding
to distances of less than about 750 Mpc) tend to be located in spiral galaxies, whereas radio-loud quasars as well as more distant
radio-quiet quasars tend to be located in ellipticals (Figure 25-6c).
However, a large percentage of these host galaxies have distorted
shapes or are otherwise peculiar. Many have nearby companion
galaxies, suggesting a link between collisions or mergers and the
quasar itself (Figure 25-6d). We will see in Section 25-6 how the
supermassive black hole model explains this link, and also helps
explain why quasars are found only at great distances from
Earth—and hence only in the distant past of the universe.
While observations like those in Figure 25-6 show that
quasars lie at the centers of galaxies, they do not really explain
what quasars are. As we will see, important clues come from a
class of galaxies that are intermediate in luminosity between
quasars and normal galaxies.

Luminous nucleus

25-3 Seyferts and radio galaxies bridge the
gap between normal galaxies and quasars

Seyfert Galaxies and Radio Galaxies
The first “missing links” between quasars and ordinary galaxies
were actually discovered before quasars themselves. In 1943, Carl
Seyfert at the Mount Wilson Observatory made a systematic study of Fast-moving jets
spiral galaxies with bright, compact
emanate from quasars,
nuclei that seem to show signs of intense and violent activity (Figure radio galaxies, and
25-7). Like quasars, the nuclei of Seyfert galaxies
these galaxies have strong emission
lines in their spectra. These galaxies are now referred to as Seyfert
galaxies.
A few percent of the most luminous spiral galaxies are Seyfert
galaxies. These galaxies range in luminosity from about 1036 to
1038 watts, which makes the brightest Seyferts as luminous as
faint quasars. Indeed, there is no sharp dividing line between the
properties of Seyferts and those of quasars. Like radio-quiet
quasars, Seyferts tend to have only weak radio emissions. And
like quasars, some Seyferts are members of interacting pairs or exhibit the vestiges of mergers and collisions.
While Seyfert galaxies resemble dim, radio-quiet quasars, certain elliptical galaxies, called radio galaxies because of their strong
radio emission, are like dim, radio-loud quasars. The energy out-

We have seen that some scientists in the 1970s preferred to challenge the Hubble law rather than accept the existence of highly
luminous objects. One reason for their skepticism was the huge
gap in energy output between normal galaxies and quasars. The
gap was bridged, however, when astronomers realized that the
centers of certain galaxies look like low-luminosity quasars.

put of radio galaxies covers approximately the same range as that
of Seyferts. The first of these peculiar galaxies was discovered in
1918 by Heber D. Curtis. His short-exposure photograph of the
giant elliptical galaxy M87 revealed a bright, starlike nucleus with
a protruding jet like that of quasar 3C 273 (see the image that
opens this chapter). Figure 25-8a shows an overall view of the entire galaxy. The Hubble Space Telescope image in Figure 25-8b
shows the jet extending outward from the nucleus of M87.
Most of the light from the central regions of M87 is thermal
radiation, with a spectrum like that of a blackbody. This is radiation that is caused by the random thermal motion of the atoms
and molecules that make up the emitting object. The spectrum of
thermal radiation depends only on the object’s temperature. For
a given temperature, an object emits the maximum amount of
thermal radiation at one particular frequency and emits less at
frequencies above or below that value. There are also absorption
lines in the spectrum of thermal radiation from M87’s nucleus,
which indicates that this radiation is due to a profusion of stars
crowded around the galaxy’s center.

By contrast, the light from M87’s jet is nonthermal radiation.
This radiation is not due to random thermal motion, and has a

of M87’s jet, the spectrum extends from radio to X-ray frequencies, which is a much broader range than thermal radiation.

jet is synchrotron radiation. As we saw in the discussion of the
Crab Nebula in Section 21-4, synchrotron radiation is produced
by relativistic electrons traveling in a strong magnetic field. (Recall that “relativistic” means “traveling near the speed of light.”)
As the electrons spiral around the magnetic field, they emit electromagnetic radiation with a distinctive spectrum very different
from that of blackbody radiation (see Figure 21-6). The presence
of synchrotron radiation coming from M87’s jet indicates that
relativistic particles are being ejected from the galaxy’s nucleus
and encountering a magnetic field.
One piece of evidence that the radiation from M87’s jet is
nonthermal is that some of it is polarized radiation, which means
that the electric fields of the waves are oriented in a specific direction. By contrast, thermal radiation—like light from the Sun,
stars, or lightbulbs—is unpolarized radiation. It consists of waves
whose electric fields are oriented at random angles. (Most radio
stations transmit signals that are polarized in a vertical plane. In
order to detect these signals, the radio antennas on cars are oriented vertically rather than horizontally.)
Jets like those found with quasars and radio galaxies are also
observed with Seyfert galaxies. One example is NGC 1097, which

nucleus—less than 2 pc (6.5 ly) in diameter—a jet extends outward some
1500 pc (5000 ly). (a: David Malin/Anglo-Australian Observatory; b: NASA and
the Hubble Heritage Team, STScI/AURA)

has jets that extend away from the galaxy’s nucleus for more than
50 pc. However, these are too faint to appear in Figure 25-7.

Jets and Radio Lobes
During the 1960s and 1970s, astronomers found that many radio
galaxies have a set of two radio lobes, one on each side of a parent galaxy. The radio lobes generally span a distance that is 5 to
10 times the size of the parent galaxy, although smaller and much
larger examples are known. The parent galaxy—almost always a
giant elliptical—sits midway between the radio lobes. Because of
their overall shape, radio galaxies (and many similar quasars) are
sometimes called double radio sources. Cygnus A, shown in
Figure 25-1, is a fine example.
The spectrum and polarization of the radio-frequency emission from the lobes of a double radio source bear all the characteristics of synchrotron radiation. This suggests that radio galaxies
should have jets of relativistic particles leading from the galaxy
out to the radio lobes. A spectacular example of this is Centaurus A, one of the brightest radio sources in the southern sky
(Figure 25-9). The peculiar parent galaxy of Centaurus A, shown
in Figure 25-9a, has a broad dust lane studded with young, hot,
massive stars. This galaxy, called NGC 5128, is thought to be an
elliptical galaxy that has collided with a spiral galaxy. Radio
waves pour from two lobes on opposite sides of the galaxy
(Figure 25-9b). A second set of radio lobes farther from the galaxy
(not shown in Figure 25-9) spans a volume 2 million light-years
across. Figure 25-9c shows an X-ray–emitting jet emanating from

of a collision with another galaxy. (b) At radio wavelengths we see

the galaxy’s nucleus. This jet, which is perpendicular to the
galaxy’s dust lane, is aimed toward one of the radio lobes.
How does a jet give rise to a radio lobe? To see the answer,
note that Centaurus A is a member of a cluster of galaxies. We
saw in Section 24-7 that the space between galaxies in such a cluster is filled with a substantial amount of hot intracluster gas
whose presence can be detected in X-ray images (see Figure
24-25). As the particles in a jet plow through this gas, they are
subjected to fluid resistance that slows them down. The particles
lose energy in the process, and this energy is converted to electromagnetic radiation at radio wavelengths.
The idea that jets of particles are found in double radio
sources is reinforced by the existence of head-tail sources. These
are radio galaxies with a concentrated source of radio emission
(the “head”) to which are attached two long radio-emitting
streams (the “tails”). Figure 25-10 shows one such head-tail
source. The “head” coincides with the position of the elliptical
galaxy NGC 1265, which is a member of the Perseus cluster of
galaxies. NGC 1265 is known to be moving through the cluster
at 2500 km/s. Figure 25-10 shows that the two “tails” are swept
backward, like smoke emerging from a fast-moving steam locomotive. This is just what we would expect if the “tails” are caused
by jets emerging from the galaxy; as NGC 1265 moves through
the intergalactic gas of the cluster, the jets feel a 2500-km/s wind
blowing them back.
Like NGC 1265, many radio galaxies are found near the centers of rich clusters of galaxies. Hence, they are probably subjected to collisions and mergers like the one that NGC 5128 has
experienced (see Figure 25-9a).
Seyfert galaxies and radio galaxies share many properties

is that we see many Seyferts and radio galaxies that are relatively
close to us and thus in the recent past, whereas we only see
quasars at great distances and hence in the remote past (Figure
25-11). Thus, quasarlike objects have not completely disappeared
from the universe, but those that remain in the present-day
universe—Seyferts and radio galaxies—are only a pale shadow of
the intensely luminous quasars that populated the heavens when
the universe was young.
Whatever lies at the centers of quasars, Seyferts, and radio
galaxies, it must deliver energy at a prodigious rate to power not
only these objects’ tremendous luminosities but also their highspeed jets. As we will see in the next section, these energy sources
are not only powerful; they are also highly variable.

25-4 Quasars, blazars, Seyferts, and radio
galaxies are active galaxies

Blazars and the Strange Case of Superluminal Motion
The first of this new class of objects to be discovered was BL Lacertae, or BL Lac for short, in the constellation Lacerta (the
Lizard). When discovered in 1929, it was mistaken for a variable

star, largely because its brightness varies by a factor of 15 within
only a few months. Careful examination, however, revealed some
fuzz (visible in Figure 25-12) around its bright, starlike core. In
the early 1970s, Joseph Miller at the University of California’s
Lick Observatory blocked out the light from the bright center of
BL Lac and managed to obtain a spectrum of the fuzz. This spectrum, which contains stellar absorption lines, strongly resembles
the spectrum of an elliptical galaxy. In other words, BL Lac is an
elliptical galaxy with an intensely luminous center.
Objects such as BL Lac are called blazars. They emit polarized light with a featureless, nonthermal spectrum typical of
synchrotron radiation, as shown in Figure 21-6b. (Careful observations have revealed emission and absorption lines in blazar
spectra, but these are swamped by the intense synchrotron radiation.) Detailed radio observations show that blazars are probably
double radio sources—but oriented so that we see their jets
end-on. For example, high-resolution studies of blazars with the
Very Large Array have revealed diffuse radio emission around a
bright core in almost all cases. A faint radio halo around a bright
radio core is exactly what you would expect if you were looking
straight down the jet from a radio galaxy. As seen from this angle, the intense synchrotron radiation from the galaxy’s bright nucleus is surrounded by weaker emission from its radio lobes.
LINK 25

The idea that blazars are radio galaxies with their jets
aimed toward the Earth was supported by the surprising discovery of movement that appeared to be faster
than the speed of light. Such superluminal motion is also observed
in some quasars, where very-long-baseline interferometry (described in Section 6-6) reveals a lumpy structure that changes
with time. For example, Figure 25-13 shows four high-resolution
.11

Inspired by the discovery of quasars, Seyferts, and luminous radio galaxies, astronomers during the 1960s and 1970s searched
for clues to these powerful energy sources. One important clue
turned out to be a new class of unusual objects called blazars.
Like quasars, blazars are extraordinarily luminous objects that
look like stars but prove to be the nuclei of distant galaxies. The
difference is that unlike a quasar, the spectrum of a blazar is almost
featureless, with hardly any absorption or emission lines at all!

Quasars like this may have evolved into radio galaxies like those shown
in Figures 25-8, 25-9, and 25-10. (a: NRAO/VLA/Brandeis/T. Cheung;

Superluminal motion was puzzling when it was first discovered, because it seemed to violate one of the basic tenets of the
special theory of relativity: Nothing can move faster than light.
Astronomers soon realized, however, that superluminal motion
can be explained as movement slower than light—once we take
into account the angle at which we view the radio source. If a relativistic beam of material is aimed close to your line of sight, it
can appear to be moving faster than the speed of light. Figure
25-14 shows an example. Quasars generally exhibit lower superluminal speeds (from c to 5c) than blazars (from 5c to 10c), probably because the relativistic jets from quasars are not aimed as
close to our line of sight as are blazar jets.

Table 25-2 summarizes the properties of different kinds of
active galactic nuclei. As this table shows, one of the features that
distinguishes different types of AGNs from each other is the width
of the emission lines in their spectra. Figures 25-3 and 25-4 show
the spectra of typical quasars in the visible and infrared parts of
the spectrum. The “spikes” in these spectra are emission lines
from hydrogen gas as well as other elements. The widths of these
emission lines indicate that individual light-emitting gas clouds
are moving within the quasar at very high speeds (10,000 km/s or
so). Some of the clouds are moving toward us, causing the emitted light to have a shorter wavelength and higher frequency, while
other clouds are moving away from us and emit light with longer
wavelength and lower frequency. This explains why the emission
lines of quasars are quite broad. By contrast, the emission lines of
radio galaxies do not show the same kind of broadening. If there

way, astronomers distinguish between different subtypes of Seyfert
galaxies (called Seyfert 1 and Seyfert 2), depending on whether
their dominant emission lines are broad or narrow.

AGN Variability and the Size of the Light Source
One characteristic that is common to all types of active galactic
nuclei is variability. For example, Figure 25-15 shows brightness

case shown here, it moves 4 ly toward the Earth and 3 ly in a transverse

observations. The brightness of 3C 273 increased by 60% from
the beginning to the end of 1982, then declined to the starting
value in just five months. Other AGNs undergo greater fluctuations in brightness (by a factor of 25 or more) that occur even
more rapidly (X-ray observations reveal that some blazars vary in
brightness over time intervals as short as 3 hours).
These fluctuations in brightness allow astronomers to place
strict limits on the maximum size of a light source. An object cannot vary in brightness faster than light can travel across that object. For example, an object that is 1 light-year in diameter cannot
vary significantly in brightness over a period of less than 1 year.

To understand this limitation, imagine an object that measures 1 light-year across, as in Figure 25-16. Suppose the entire
object emits a brief flash of light. Photons from that part of the
object nearest the Earth arrive at our telescopes first. Photons
from the middle of the object arrive at Earth 6 months later. Finally, light from the far side of the object arrives a year after the
first photons. Although the object emitted a sudden flash of light,
we observe a gradual increase in brightness that lasts a full year.
In other words, the flash is stretched out over an interval equal

to the difference in the light travel time between the nearest and
farthest observable regions of the object.
The rapid flickering exhibited by active galactic nuclei means
that they emit their energy from a small volume, possibly less than
1 light-day across. In other words, a region no larger than our solar system can emit more energy per second than a thousand
galaxies! Astrophysicists therefore face the challenge of explaining how so much energy can be produced in such a very small
volume.

½ year later than the light from B and 1 year later than
the light from A. Hence we see the sudden flash of light
spread over a full year.

Figure 25-16
A Limit on the Speed of Variations in Brightness
The rapidity with which the brightness of an object can
vary significantly is limited by the time it takes light to
travel across the object. If the object 1 light-year in
size emits a sudden flash of light, the flash will be
observed from Earth to last a full year. If the object is
2 light-years in size, brightness variations will last at
least 2 years as seen from Earth, and so on.

The Eddington Limit and Black Hole Sizes
How large a black hole would be needed to power an active
galactic nucleus? You might think that what really matters is not
the size of the black hole, but rather the amount of gas that falls
onto it and releases energy. However, there is a natural limit to
the luminosity that can be radiated by accretion onto a compact
object like a black hole. This is called the Eddington limit, after
the British astrophysicist Sir Arthur Eddington.
If the luminosity exceeds the Eddington limit, there is so
much radiation pressure—the pressure produced by photons
streaming outward from the infalling material—that the surrounding gas is pushed outward rather than falling inward onto the
black hole. Without a source of gas to provide energy, the luminosity naturally decreases to below the Eddington limit, at which
point gas can again fall inward. This limit allows us to calculate
the minimum mass of an active galactic nucleus.
Numerically, the Eddington limit is:

The tremendous luminosity of an active galactic nucleus must
be less than or equal to its Eddington limit, so this limit must be
very high indeed. Hence, the mass of the black hole must also be
quite large. For example, consider the quasar 3C 273 (shown in
the image that opens this chapter and in Figure 25-6a), which has
a luminosity of about 3 ⫻ 1013 L䉺. To calculate the minimum
mass of a black hole that could continue to attract gas to power
the quasar, assume that the quasar’s luminosity equals the Eddington limit. Inserting LEdd ⫽ 3 ⫻ 1013 L䉺 into the above equa-

Theory suggests that unlike stellar-mass black holes,
which require a supernova to produce them (see
Figure 20-26), supermassive black holes can be produced without extreme pressures or densities. This may help to
explain why they appear to be a feature of so many galaxies.

Measuring Black Hole Masses in Galaxies
One galaxy that probably has a black hole at its center is the Andromeda Galaxy (M31), shown in Figure 24-3. M31 is only
750 kpc (2.5 million ly) from Earth, close enough that details in
its core as small as 1 parsec across can be resolved under the best
seeing conditions.
In the mid-1980s, astronomers made high-resolution spectroscopic observations of M31’s core. By measuring the Doppler
shifts of spectral lines at various locations in the core, we can determine the orbital speeds of the stars about the galaxy’s nucleus.
Figure 25-17 plots the results for the innermost 80 arcseconds of M31. (At M31’s distance, this corresponds to a linear distance of 290 pc or 950 ly.) Note that the rotation curve in the
galaxy’s nucleus does not follow the trend set in the outer core.
Rather, there are sharp peaks—one on the approaching side of
the galaxy and the other on the receding side—within 5 arcsec of
the galaxy’s center.
The most straightforward interpretation is that the peaks are
caused by the orbital motions of stars around M31’s center. Stars
on one side of the galaxy’s center are approaching us while stars
on the other side are receding from us.
LINK 25

The high speeds of stars orbiting close to M31’s center
indicate the presence of a massive central object. We
can use Newton’s form of Kepler’s third law (described
in Section 4-7 and Box 4-4) and our knowledge of these stars’ orbital speeds to calculate the mass of this object. (As described in
Section 23-6, much the same method is used to calculate the mass
of the supermassive black hole at the center of our own Milky
Way Galaxy. The difference is that we can track individual stars
at the center of our Galaxy, while the data in Figure 25-17 comes
from the combined light of many stars in M31.) Such calculations
show that there must be about 3 ⫻ 107 solar masses within 5 pc
(16 ly) of the center of M31. That much matter confined to such
a small volume strongly suggests the presence of a supermassive
black hole. Observations of M31 with the Chandra X-ray Observatory are consistent with this picture.

As long ago as 1968, the British astronomer Donald Lynden-Bell
pointed out that a black hole lurking at the center of a galaxy
could be the “central engine” that powers an active galactic nucleus. Lynden-Bell theorized that as gases fall onto a black hole,
their gravitational energy would be converted into radiation. (As
we saw in Section 22-3, a similar process produces radiation from
black holes in close binary star systems.) To produce as much radiation as is seen from active galactic nuclei, the black hole would
have to be very massive. But even a gigantic black hole would occupy a volume much smaller than our solar system—exactly what
is needed to explain how active galactic nuclei can vary so rapidly in brightness.

supermassive black holes like the one in M31. Unfortunately, this
technique for identifying black holes is difficult to apply to
quasars, which are very distant and have small angular sizes. The
evidence for supermassive black holes in quasars is therefore circumstantial, yet compelling: No other known energy source could
provide enough power to sustain a quasar’s intense light output.
If most galaxies have supermassive black holes at their centers, and supermassive black holes are the “central engines” of active galactic nuclei, why aren’t all galaxies active? Why are there
no nearby quasars? Why do radio galaxies and some quasars have
jets? As we will see in the next section, the answers to all these
questions may be provided by a model of what happens in an active galactic nucleus.

25-6 Quasars, blazars, and radio galaxies

Accretion onto a supermassive black hole is the most likely explanation of the immense energy output of active galactic nuclei. The
challenge to astrophysicists is to understand how that accretion
takes place. A successful model of the accretion process must also
explain other properties of active galactic nuclei, including their
unusual spectra, variable light output, and energetic jets.

In the leading model of this process, at the heart of an active
galaxy is a supermassive black hole surrounded by an accretion
disk, an immense disk of matter captured by the hole’s gravity and spi- The power source for

but far larger and far more dynamic.
The Cosmic Connections figure depicts the physics of such accretion disks.
Imagine a billion-solar-mass black hole sitting at the center
of a galaxy, surrounded by a rotating accretion disk. According
to Kepler’s third law, the inner regions of this accretion disk
would orbit the hole more rapidly than would the outer parts.
Thus, the rapidly spinning inner regions would constantly rub
against the slower moving gases in the outer regions. This friction, aided by magnetic forces within the disk, would cause the
gases to lose energy and spiral inward toward the black hole.
As the gases move inward within the accretion disk, they are
compressed and heated to very high temperatures. This causes the
accretion disk to glow, thus producing the brilliant luminosity of
an active galactic nucleus. The temperature of material in the accretion disk reaches 100,000 K or more, which helps explain why
many active galactic nuclei emit far more X-ray and gamma-ray
radiation than do ordinary galaxies.
In this model, the fundamental source of the energy output
by an active galactic nucleus is gravitational energy released by
infalling material in the accretion disk. We saw in Section 20-6
that gravitational energy is also what powers the immense light
output of a core-collapse supernova. The difference between such
a supernova and an active galactic nucleus is that the infall of a
supernova’s outer layers is a one-time event, while gas in an
AGN’s accretion disk falls inward continuously. Any variations
in the density of this infalling gas will cause the disk’s luminosity
to fluctuate, giving rise to the brightness variations observed by
astronomers (see Figure 25-15).
Supercomputer simulations can help us visualize the flow of
matter in such an accretion disk. These simulations combine general relativity with equations describing gas flow. At first, matter
accelerates to supersonic speeds as it spirals inward toward a
black hole. But because the matter is rotating around the hole as
well as moving toward it, this inward rush stops abruptly near
the hole. The reason is the law of conservation of angular momentum (described in Section 8-4 and Section 21-3). Thanks to
this law, rotating objects of all kinds tend to expand (like a spinning lump of dough that expands to make a pizza) rather than
contract. The inward motion of gases stops where this tendency
to expand outward balances the pull of the black hole’s gravity.
As a result, not all of the infalling gas reaches the black hole. Instead, part of the gas can become concentrated in high-speed
orbits quite close to the hole. The sudden halt in the supersonic
inflow creates a shock wave, which defines the inner edge of
the accretion disk (see the Cosmic Connections figure). Only a

Quasars and active galaxies are thought to be powered by gravitational
energy released when gas falls toward a central supermassive black hole.
Due to conservation of angular momentum, the gas does not fall straight
into the black hole. Instead, it must negotiate its way through an accretion
disk.

Because of the constant inward crowding of hot gases, pressures climb rapidly in the inner accretion disk. These pressures relieve the congestion by expelling matter at extremely high speeds.

Magnetic forces play a crucial role in steering these
fast-moving particles. These forces arise because the
hot gases in the accretion disk are ionized, forming a
plasma, and the motions of this plasma generate a magnetic field
(see Section 16-9). As the plasma in the disk rotates around the
black hole, it pulls the magnetic field along with it. But because
the disk rotates faster in its inner regions than at its outer rim, the
magnetic field becomes severely twisted. This twisted field forms
two helix shapes, one on either side of the plane of the disk. Relativistic particles flowing outward from the accretion disk tend to
follow these magnetic field lines. The result is that the outflowing
beams of particles are focused into two jets oriented perpendicular to the plane of the accretion disk, as Figure 25-18 shows.
Figure 25-19 is an artist’s conception of the accretion disk and
jets as they might appear from a nearby planet.
Observations of active galaxies provide evidence in support
of this model. One example is the radio galaxy NGC 4261, shown
in Figure 22-16, whose radio lobes appear to emanate from an
accretion disk around a supermassive black hole. While the accre-

torus, about 250 pc (800 ly) in diameter orbiting the central black
hole (Figure 25-20). The motions of this torus reveal the mass of
the central black hole to be 1.2 ⫻ 109 M䉺.

Figure 25-18
Jets from a Supermassive Black Hole The rotation of the accretion
disk surrounding a supermassive black hole twists the disk’s magnetic
field lines into a helix. The field then channels the flow of subatomic
particles pouring out of the disk. Over a distance of about a light-year,
this channeling changes a broad flow into a pair of tightly focused jets,
one on each side of the disk. Figure 18-16 shows a similar process that
takes place on a much smaller scale in protostars. (NASA and Ann Feild,
Space Telescope Science Institute)

If there were no dusty torus around an accreting supermassive
black hole, an observer could view such a black hole from any
angle and see the intense radiation from the accretion disk. But
the presence of such a torus seems to be a natural result of the
accretion process. As a result, from certain angles the torus blocks
the view of the innermost part of the active galactic nucleus. This
idea offers a single explanation for several types of active galaxies. Many astronomers suspect that the main difference between
blazars, quasars, and radio galaxies is only the angle at which the
black hole “central engine” is viewed. This idea is called the unified model of active galactic nuclei.
Figure 25-21 illustrates the unified model for a luminous active galactic nucleus with jets. If an observer looks straight down
the axis of the jet, the observed radiation is dominated by synchrotron radiation from the jet. This has a continuous spectrum
with no emission or absorption lines (see Figure 21-6b). Hence,
the observer sees a blazar, with a nearly featureless spectrum.

686

Chapter 25

the Doppler effect. The observer also sees intense thermal radiation from the accretion disk and synchrotron radiation from the
jets. From this angle, what the observer sees is a radio-loud quasar.
If the observer looks nearly edge-on at the torus, the accretion disk will be completely hidden. Some of the light reaching
the observer comes from hot gas flowing out of the accretion
disk, and this light has an emission-line spectrum. But this gas is
not moving rapidly either toward or away from the observer, so
there is little Doppler shift and the emission lines are narrow. The
synchrotron emission from the jets is still visible, and so our observer reports seeing a radio galaxy.
It may happen that no jets are present, which means that the
active galactic nucleus will lack the powerful synchrotron radiation that particles in a jet produce. In this case, an observer viewing the “central engine” either face-on or at an oblique angle will
see a radio-quiet quasar.
Unlike our imaginary observer, we cannot move the vast distances through space that would be needed to view a given active
galaxy from different angles. Instead, we may see a given active
galaxy as either a blazar, a quasar, or a radio galaxy, depending
on how that galaxy’s accretion disk and torus are oriented to our
line of sight.

CAUTION! Note that we are really making use of two differ-

ent but complementary models here. The unified model says that
different types of active galactic nuclei are really different views
of the same type of “central engine,” while the accretion-disk
model explains how the “central engine” works.

A Dusty Torus Around a Supermassive Black Hole This immense
doughnut of dust and gas orbits the black hole at the center of the radio
galaxy NGC 4261. The radio lobes of this galaxy appear to be the
endpoints of jets emerging parallel to the plane of this torus (see Figure
22-16). (L. Ferrarese/Johns Hopkins University, NASA)

At a more oblique angle, the observer gets a clear view of the
luminous accretion disk and the turbulent region around the black
hole. Because gases move at many different velocities in this region, the observer sees spectral lines that have been broadened by

The accretion-disk idea helps to explain why there are no
nearby quasars (see Figure 25-5). Over time, most of the available
gas and dust surrounding a quasar’s “central engine” is accreted
onto the black hole. The “central engine” has less and less infalling matter to act as “fuel,” and the quasar becomes much less
active. The result is a relatively less luminous radio galaxy or

Providing Fresh “Fuel” for a Supermassive Black Hole A small

supermassive black hole at Cygnus A’s very center. This false-color

• To be seen at such large distances, quasars must be very luminous, typically about 1000 times brighter than an ordinary galaxy.
• About 10% of all quasars are strong sources of radio emission
and are therefore called “radio-loud”; the remaining 90% are
“radio-quiet.”
• Some of the energy emitted by quasars is synchrotron radiation
produced by high-speed particles traveling in a strong magnetic
field.
Seyfert Galaxies: Seyfert galaxies are spiral galaxies with bright
nuclei that are strong sources of radiation. Seyfert galaxies seem
to be nearby, low-luminosity, radio-quiet quasars.
Radio Galaxies: Radio galaxies are elliptical galaxies located midway between the lobes of a double radio source.
• Relativistic particles are ejected from the nucleus of a radio
galaxy along two oppositely directed beams.
Blazars: Blazars are bright, starlike objects that can vary rapidly in
their luminosity. They are probably radio galaxies or quasars seen
end-on, with a jet of relativistic particles aimed toward the Earth.

Seyfert galaxy. (A Seyfert galaxy is essentially a low-luminosity,
radio-quiet quasar. Whether it is a Seyfert 1 with predominantly
broad emission lines or a Seyfert 2 with predominantly narrow
lines may depend on whether we view its “central engine” more
nearly face-on or edge-on.)
Finally, the accretion-disk idea explains what happens when
active galaxies collide or merge with other galaxies. Such collisions and mergers can transfer gas and dust from one galaxy to
another, providing more “fuel” for a supermassive black hole.
For example, the image in Figure 25-22 shows a close-up view of
a supermassive black hole about to take in more “fuel” from a
merger. Thus, it is not surprising that many of the most luminous
active galaxies are also those that have recently undergone collisions, such as the radio galaxy Centaurus A shown in Figure 25-9.
Eventually an active galaxy will run out of “fuel” altogether,
and its central supermassive black hole will become inactive.
Most galaxies, including our own Milky Way, have supermassive
black holes at their centers that are not presently active. Perhaps
many of these galaxies once led much more dramatic lives as
quasars or radio galaxies.

• Rapid fluctuations in the brightness of active galaxies indicate
that the region that emits radiation is quite small.
Black Holes and Active Galactic Nuclei: The preponderance of
evidence suggests that an active galactic nucleus consists of a supermassive black hole onto which matter accretes.
• As gases spiral in toward the supermassive black hole, some of
the gas may be redirected to become two jets of high-speed particles that are aligned perpendicularly to the accretion disk.
• An observer sees a radio galaxy when the accretion disk is
viewed nearly edge-on, so that its light is blocked by a surrounding torus. At a steeper angle, the observer sees a quasar. If one of
the jets is aimed almost directly at the Earth, a blazar is observed.

which haunted Johannes Kepler as long ago as 1610, was brought
to public attention in the early 1800s by the German amateur astronomer Heinrich Olbers.

Olbers’ Paradox and Newton’s Static Universe

Einstein’s Revolution and His “Greatest Blunder”
BL

INK 2

Albert Einstein overturned this view of space and time.
His special theory of relativity (recall Section 22-1 and
Box 22-1) shows that measurements with clocks and
rulers depend on the motion of the observer. What is more, Einstein’s general theory of relativity (Section 22-2) tells us that gravity curves the fabric of space. As a result, the matter that occupies
the universe influences the overall shape of space throughout the
universe.
If we represent the universe as a sheet of graph paper, the
sheet is not perfectly flat but has a dip wherever there is a concentration of mass, such as a person, a planet, or a star (see
Figure 22-4). Because of gravitational effects, clocks run at different rates depending on whether they are close to or far from a
massive object, as Figure 22-7a shows.
What does the general theory of relativity, with its many differences from the Newtonian picture, have to say about the structure
Einstein narrowly missed
of the universe as a whole? Einstein
attacked this problem shortly after predicting that our
formulating his general theory in universe is not static
1915. At that time, the prevailing
view was that the universe was static, just as Newton had thought.
Einstein was therefore dismayed to find that his calculations
could not produce a truly static universe. According to general
relativity, the universe must be either expanding or contracting.
In a desperate move to force his theory to predict a static universe, he added to the equations of general relativity a term called
the cosmological constant (denoted by ⌳, the capital Greek letter
lambda). The cosmological constant was intended to represent a
pressure that tends to make the universe expand as a whole.
Einstein’s idea was that this pressure would just exactly balance
gravitational attraction, so that the universe would be static and
not collapse.
6.3

Olbers and his contemporaries pictured a universe of stars scattered more or less randomly throughout infinite space. Isaac
Newton himself thought that no other model made sense. The
gravitational forces between any finite number of stars, he argued, would in time cause them all to fall together, and the universe would soon be a compact blob.
Obviously, this has not happened. Newton concluded that
we must be living amid a static, infinite expanse of stars. In this
model, the universe is infinitely old, and it will exist forever without major changes in its structure. Olbers noticed, however, that
a static, infinite universe presents a major puzzle.
If space goes on forever, with stars scattered throughout it,
then any line of sight must eventually hit a star. In this case, no
matter where you look in the night sky, you should ultimately see
a star. The entire sky should be as bright as an average star, so, even
at night, the sky should blaze like the surface of the Sun. Olbers’s
paradox is that the night sky is actually dark (Figure 26-1).
Olbers’s paradox suggests that something is wrong with Newton’s infinite, static universe. According to the classical, Newtonian picture of reality, space is like a gigantic flat sheet of inflexible,
rectangular graph paper. (Space is actually three-dimensional,
but it is easier to visualize just two of its three dimensions. In a
similar way, an ordinary map represents the three-dimensional

surface of the Earth, with its hills and valleys, as a flat, twodimensional surface.)
This rigid, flat, Newtonian space stretches on and on, totally
independent of stars or galaxies or anything else. The same is true
of time in Newton’s view of the universe; a Newtonian clock ticks
steadily and monotonously forever, never slowing down or speeding up. Furthermore, Newtonian space and time are unrelated, in
that a clock runs at the same rate no matter where in the universe
it is located.

ANALOGY Einstein’s cosmological constant is analogous to the
pressure of gas inside a bicycle tire. This pressure exactly balances the inward force exerted by the stretched rubber of the tire
itself, so the tire maintains the same size.

Figure 26-1

RI V UXG

The Dark Night Sky If the universe were infinitely old and filled
uniformly with stars that were fixed in place, the night sky would be
ablaze with light. In fact the night sky is dark, punctuated only by the
light from isolated stars and galaxies, Hence, this simple picture of an
infinite, static universe cannot be correct. (NASA; ESA; and the Hubble
Heritage Team, STScI/AURA)

Unlike other aspects of Einstein’s theories, the cosmological
constant did not have a firm basis in physics. He just added it to
make the general theory of relativity agree with the prejudice that
the universe is static.
Because Einstein doubted his original equations, he missed an
incredible opportunity: He could have postulated that we live in an
expanding universe. Einstein has been quoted as saying in his

Cosmology: The Origin and Evolution of the Universe

CAUTION! It is important to realize that the expansion of the

later years that the cosmological constant was “the greatest blunder of my life.” (In fact, the cosmological constant plays an important role in modern cosmology, although a very different one from
what Einstein proposed. We will explore this in Section 26-7.)
Instead, the first hint that we live in an expanding universe
came more than a decade later from the observations of Edwin
Hubble. As we will see in Section 26-3, Hubble’s discovery provides the resolution of Olbers’s paradox.

universe occurs primarily in the vast spaces that separate clusters of galaxies. Just as the chocolate chips in Figure 26-2 do not
expand as the cake expands during baking, galaxies themselves
do not expand. Einstein and others have established that an object that is held together by its own gravity, such as a galaxy or
a cluster of galaxies, is always contained within a patch of nonexpanding space. A galaxy’s gravitational field produces this
nonexpanding region, which is indistinguishable from the rigid
space described by Newton. Thus, the Earth and your body, for
example, are not getting any bigger. Only the distance between
widely separated galaxies increases with time. The Cosmic Connections figure has more to say about several misconceptions
concerning the expanding universe.

6.4

Hubble is usually credited with discovering that our
universe is expanding. He found a simple linear relationship between the distances to remote galaxies and
the redshifts of the spectral lines of those galaxies (review Section
24-5, especially Figures 24-16 and 24-17). This relationship, now
called the Hubble law, states that the greater the distance to a
galaxy, the greater is the galaxy’s redshift. Thus, remote galaxies
are moving away from us with speeds proportional to their
distances.

The Hubble law is a direct proportionality—that is, a galaxy
twice as far away is receding from us twice as fast. This is just
what we would expect in an expanding universe. To see why this
is so, imagine a grid of parallel lines (as on a piece of graph paper) crisscrossing the universe. Figure 26-3a shows a series of
such gridlines 100 Mpc apart, along with five galaxies labeled A,
B, C, D, and E that happen to lie where gridlines cross. As the
universe expands in all directions, the gridlines and the attached
galaxies spread apart. (This is just what would happen if the universe were a two-dimensional rubber sheet that was being pulled
equally on all sides. Alternatively, you can imagine that Figure
26-3a depicts a very small portion of the chocolate chip cake in
Figure 26-2, with galaxies taking the place of chocolate chips.)
Figure 26-3b shows the universe at a later time, when the
gridlines are 50% farther apart (150 Mpc) and all the distances
between galaxies are 50% greater than in Figure 26-3a. Imagine
that A represents our galaxy, the Milky Way. The table accompanying Figure 26-3 shows how far each of the other galaxies
have moved away from us during the expansion: Galaxies A and
B and galaxies A and E were originally 100 Mpc apart, and have
moved away from each other by an additional 50 Mpc; A and C,
which were originally 200 Mpc apart, have increased their separation by an additional 100 Mpc; and the distance between A and
D, originally 300 Mpc, has increased by an additional 150 Mpc.
In other words, the increase in distance between any pair of galaxies is in direct proportion to the original distance; if the original

The Hubble Law and the Expanding Universe
The Hubble law can be stated as a very simple equation that relates the recessional velocity v of a galaxy to its distance d from
the Earth:
v ⫽ H0d
where H0 is the Hubble constant. Because remote galaxies are getting farther and farther apart as time goes on, astronomers say
that the universe is expanding.

ANALOGY What does it actually mean to say that the universe
is expanding? According to general relativity, space itself is not
rigid. The amount of space between widely separated locations
changes over time. A good analogy is that of baking a chocolate
chip cake, as in Figure 26-2. As the cake expands during baking, the amount of space between the chocolate chips gets larger
and larger. In the same way, as the universe expands, the amount
of space between widely separated galaxies increases. The expansion of the universe is the expansion of space.

Six chocolate chips are evenly
spaced within an unbaked cake.

The Expanding Chocolate Chip Cake Analogy The

a chocolate chip cake as the cake expands during baking.
(The cake is floating weightlessly inside the oven of an
orbiting spacecraft crewed by hungry astronauts.) All of the
chocolate chips in the cake recede from one another as the
cake expands, just as all the galaxies recede from one
another as the universe expands.

if we see all the distant galaxies rushing away from us, then we
must be in a special position at the very center of the universe.
In fact, the expansion of the universe looks the same from the
vantage point of any galaxy. For example, as seen from galaxy
D in Figure 26-3, the initial distances to galaxies A, B, and C
are 300 Mpc, 200 Mpc, and 100 Mpc, respectively. Between
parts a and b of the figure, these distances increase by 150 Mpc,
100 Mpc, and 50 Mpc, respectively. So, as seen from D as well,
the recessional velocity increases in direct proportion with the
distance, and in the same proportion as seen from A. In other
words, no matter which galaxy you call home, you will see all
the other galaxies receding from you in accordance with the
same Hubble law (and the same Hubble constant) that we observe from Earth.

some later time the spacing between adjacent galaxies has increased to

galaxies, the greater the amount that distance has increased. This agrees
with the Hubble law.

distance is twice as great, the increase in distance is also twice
as great.
To see what this tells us about the recessional velocities of
galaxies, remember that velocity is equal to the distance moved
divided by the elapsed time. (For example, if you traveled in a
straight line for 360 kilometers in 4 hours, your velocity was
(360 km)/(4 hours) ⫽ 90 kilometers per hour.) Because the distance that each galaxy moves away from A during the expansion
is directly proportional to its original distance from A, it follows

INK 2

Figure 26-2 also shows that the expansion of the universe looks the same from one galaxy as from any
other. An insect sitting on any one of the chocolate
chips would see all the other chips moving away. If the cake were
infinitely long, it would not actually have a center; as seen from
any chocolate chip within such a cake, the cake would extend off
to infinity to the left and to the right, and the expansion of the
cake would appear to be centered on that chip. Likewise, because
every point in the universe appears to be at the center of the expansion, it follows that our universe has no center at all. (Later
in this chapter we will see evidence that the universe, like our
imaginary cake, is indeed infinite.)

CAUTION! “If the universe is expanding, what is it expanding
into?” This commonly asked question arises only if we take our
chocolate chip cake analogy too literally. In Figure 26-2, the
cake (representing the universe) expands in three-dimensional
space into the surrounding air. But the actual universe includes
all space; there is nothing “beyond” it, because there is no “beyond.” Asking “What lies beyond the universe?” is as meaningless as asking “Where on the Earth is north of the North Pole?”
The ongoing expansion of space explains why the light from
remote galaxies is redshifted. Imagine a photon coming toward us
from a distant galaxy. As the photon travels through space, the
space is expanding, so the photon’s
wavelength becomes stretched. The redshifts of distant

nearby galaxies, as expressed by the Hubble law.

shift. Doppler shifts are caused by an object’s motion through

space, whereas a cosmological redshift is caused by the expansion
of space (Figure 26-4).

Cosmological Redshift and Lookback Time
We can calculate the factor by which the universe has expanded
since some ancient time from the redshift of light emitted by objects at that time. As we saw in Section 24-5, redshift (z) is defined as
␭ ⫺ ␭0
z⫽ ᎏ
␭0
In this equation ␭0 is the unshifted wavelength of a photon and
␭ is the wavelength we observe. For example, ␭0 could be the
wavelength of a particular emission line in the spectrum of light
leaving a remote galaxy. As the galaxy’s light travels through
space, its wavelength is stretched by the expansion of the universe. Thus, at our telescopes we observe the spectral line to have
a wavelength ␭. The ratio ␭/␭0 is a measure of the amount of
stretching. By rearranging terms in the preceding equation, we
can solve for this ratio to obtain
␭
ᎏ ⫽1⫹z
␭0
For example, consider a galaxy with a redshift z ⫽ 3. Since
the time that light left that galaxy, the universe has expanded by
a factor of 1 ⫹ z ⫽ 1 ⫹ 3 ⫽ 4. In other words, when the light left
that galaxy, representative distances between widely separated
galaxies were only one-quarter as large as they are today. A representative volume of space, which is proportional to the cube of
its dimensions, was only (1/4)3 ⫽ 1/64 as large as it is today.

Thus, the density of matter in such a volume was 64 times greater
than it is today.
If you know the redshift z of a distant object such as a remote galaxy, you can calculate that object’s recessional velocity v
(see Box 24-2 for how this is done). Then, using the Hubble law,
you can determine the distance d to that object if you know the
value of the Hubble constant H0. This also tells you the lookback
time of that object, that is, how far into the past you are looking
when you see that object. For example, if the lookback time for
a distant galaxy is a billion years, that means the light from the
galaxy took a billion years to reach us and so we are seeing it as
it was a billion years ago. The images that open this chapter show
supernovae in distant galaxies with lookback times from 7.7 to
9.0 billion years. (Table 25-1 lists the distance at which we see
objects with different redshifts. This distance measured in lightyears is equal to the lookback time in years.)
Distances and lookback times determined in this way are
somewhat uncertain, because there is some uncertainty in the
value of the Hubble constant. Furthermore, as we will see in
Section 26-8, the universe has not always expanded at the same
rate. This means that the value of the Hubble constant H0 was
different in the distant past. (In other words, the Hubble “constant” is not actually constant in time.) Furthermore, the correct
distance d to use in the Hubble law is not the distance at which
we see the object, but rather the distance between us and the object now. The latter distance (which we called the commoving radial distance in Section 25-1) is larger because during the time
that it takes to reach us from a distant object, that object has
moved farther away due to the expansion of the universe.
To avoid dealing with these uncertainties and complications,
astronomers commonly refer to times in the distant past in terms
of redshift rather than years. For example, instead of asking,
“How common were quasars 5 billion years ago?,” an astronomer
might ask, “How common were quasars at z ⫽ 1.0?” In this question, “at z ⫽ 1.0” is a shorthand way of saying “at the lookback
time that corresponds to objects at z ⫽ 1.0.” We will use this terminology later in this chapter. Remember that the greater the redshift, the greater the lookback time and hence the further back
into time we are peering.

The Cosmological Principle
These ideas about the expanding universe demonstrate the central
philosophy of cosmology. In cosmology, unlike other sciences, we
cannot carry out controlled experiments or even make comparisons: There is only one universe that we can observe. To make
progress in cosmology, we must accept certain philosophical assumptions or abandon hope of understanding the nature of the
universe. The Hubble law provides a classic example. It could be
interpreted to mean that we are at the center of the universe. We
reject this interpretation, however, because it violates a cosmological extension of Copernicus’s belief that we do not occupy a special location in space.
When Einstein began applying his general theory of relativity
to cosmology, he made a daring assumption: Over very large distances the universe is homogeneous, meaning that every region is
the same as every other region, and isotropic, meaning that the
universe looks the same in every direction. In other words, if you
could stand back and look at a very large region of space, any

Cosmology: The Origin and Evolution of the Universe

26-3 The expanding universe emerged from
a cataclysmic event called the Big Bang
The Hubble flow shows that the universe has been expanding for
billions of years. This means that in the past the matter in the universe must have been closer together and therefore denser than it
is today. If we look far enough into the very distant past, there
must have been a time when the density of matter was almost inconceivably high. This leads us to conclude that some sort of
tremendous event caused ultradense matter to begin the expansion that continues to the present day. This event, called the Big
Bang, marks the creation of the universe.

CAUTION! It is not correct to think of the Big Bang as an explosion. When a bomb explodes, pieces of debris fly off into
space from a central location. If you could trace all the pieces
back to their origin, you could find out exactly where the bomb
had been. This process is not possible with the universe, however, because the universe itself always has and always will consist of all space. As we have seen, the universe logically cannot
have an edge (see the discussion of the expanding chocolate chip
cake in Section 26-2).

By comparison, the age of our solar system is only 4.56 billion years, or about one-third the age of the universe. Thus, the
formation of our home planet is a relatively recent event in the
history of the cosmos.
The value of H0 has an uncertainty of about 5%, so our simple estimate of the age of the universe is likewise uncertain by at
least 5%. Furthermore, the formula T0 ⫽ 1/H0 is at best an approximation, because in deriving it we assumed that the universe
expands at a constant rate. In Section 26-8 we will discuss how
the expansion rate of the universe has changed over its history.
When these factors are taken into consideration, we find that the
age of the universe is 13.7 billion years, with an uncertainty of
about 0.2 billion years. This is remarkably close to our simple
estimate.

Whatever the true age of the universe, it must be at
least as old as the oldest stars. The oldest stars that we
can observe readily lie in the Milky Way’s globular
clusters (see Section 19-4 and Section 23-1). The most recent observations, combined with calculations based on the theory of
stellar evolution, indicate that these stars are about 13.4 billion
years old (with an uncertainty of about 6%). Encouragingly
enough, this is less than the calculated age of the universe: The
oldest stars in our universe are younger than the universe itself!

How long ago did the Big Bang take place? To estimate an answer, imagine two galaxies that today are separated by a distance
d and receding from each other with a velocity v. A movie of
these galaxies would show them flying apart. If you run the movie
backward, you would see the two galaxies approaching each
other as time runs in reverse. We can calculate the time T0 it will
take for the galaxies to collide by using the equation

Note that the distance of separation, d, has canceled out and
does not appear in the final expression. This means that T0 is the
same for all galaxies. This is the time in the past when all galaxies were crushed together, the time back to the Big Bang. In other
words, the reciprocal of the Hubble constant H0 gives us an estimate of the age of the universe, which is one reason why H0 is
such an important quantity in cosmology.
Observations suggest that H0 ⫽ 73 km/s/Mpc to within a few
percent, and this is the value we choose as our standard (see
Section 24-5). Using this value, our estimate for the age of the
universe is

one part of the universe would look basically the same as any
other part, with the same kinds of galaxies distributed through
space in the same way. The assumption that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic constitutes the cosmological principle. It
gives precise meaning to the idea that we do not occupy a special
location in space.
Models of the universe based on the cosmological principle
have proven remarkably successful in describing the structure and
evolution of the universe and in interpreting observational data.
All the discussion about the universe in this chapter and the next

Our Observable Universe and the Dark Night Sky
The Big Bang helps resolve Olbers’s paradox, which we discussed
in Section 26-1. We know that the universe had a definite beginning, and thus its age is finite (as opposed to infinite). If the universe is 13.7 billion years old, then the most distant objects that
we can see are those whose light has traveled 13.7 billion years
to reach us. (Due to the expansion of the universe, these objects
are now more than 13.7 billion light-years away.) As a result, we

All of the objects that we can
see with even the most powerful
telescopes lie within our
observable universe.
Because the universe has continued to expand over
the past 13.7 billion years, the radius of our cosmic
light horizon is greater than 13.7 billion light-years.
The present radius is about 47 billion light-years.

These galaxies lie within
our cosmic light horizon,
and so are part of our
observable universe.

These galaxies lie outside our cosmic light horizon.
Their light has been traveling toward us for 13.7
billion years, but they are so far away that the
light has not yet reached us. Hence they are
outside our present-day observable universe.

Our Observable Universe The part of the universe that we can observe
lies within our cosmic light horizon. The galaxies that we can just barely
make out with our most powerful telescopes lie inside our cosmic light

cosmic light horizon (and hence the
size of our observable universe) increases. Galaxies are distributed
sparsely enough in our observable universe that there are no stars
along most of our lines of sight. This helps explain why the night
sky is dark.
Besides the finite age of the universe, a second effect also contributes significantly to the darkness of the night sky—the redshift. According to the Hubble law, the greater the distance to a
galaxy, the greater the redshift. When a photon is redshifted, its
wavelength becomes longer, and its energy—which is inversely
proportional to its wavelength (see Section 5-5)—decreases. Consequently, even though there are many galaxies far from the Earth,
they have large redshifts and their light does not carry much energy. A galaxy nearly at the cosmic light horizon has a nearly infinite redshift, meaning that the light we receive from that galaxy
carries practically no energy at all. This decrease in photon en-

ergy because of the expansion of the universe decreases the brilliance of remote galaxies, helping to make the night sky dark.
The concept of a Big Bang origin for the universe is a straightforward, logical consequence of having an expanding universe. If
you can just imagine far enough back into the past, you can arrive at a time 13.7 billion years ago, when the density throughout the universe was infinite. As a result, throughout the universe
space and time were completely jumbled up in a condition of infinite curvature similar to that at the singularity found at the center of a black hole (see Section 22-5). For this reason, a better
name for the Big Bang is the cosmic singularity. Thanks to the infinite curvature, the usual laws of physics do not tell us exactly
what happened at the moment of the Big Bang.
A very short time after the Big Bang, space and time began
to behave in the way we think of them today. This short time interval, called the Planck time (tP), is given by the following
expression:

We do not yet understand how space, time, and matter behaved in that brief but important interval from
the beginning of the Big Bang to the Planck time, about
10–43 seconds later. (Indeed, the laws of physics suggest that it
may be impossible ever to know what happened during this extremely short time interval.) Hence, the Planck time represents a
limit to our knowledge of conditions at the very beginning of the
universe.

26-4 The microwave radiation that fills all
space is evidence of a hot Big Bang
One of the major advances in twentieth-century astronomy was
the discovery of the origin of the heavy elements. We know today that essentially all the heavy elements are created by thermonuclear reactions at the centers of stars and in supernovae (see
Chapter 20). The starting point of all these reactions is the fusion
of hydrogen into helium, which we described in Section 16-1. But
as astronomers began to understand the details of thermonuclear
synthesis in the 1960s, they were faced with a dilemma: There is
far more helium in the universe than could have been created by
hydrogen fusion in stars.
For example, the Sun consists of about 74% hydrogen and
25% helium by mass, leaving only 1% for all the remaining heavier elements combined. This 1% can be understood as material
produced inside earlier generations of massive stars that long ago
cast these heavy elements out into space when they became supernovae. Some freshly made helium, produced by the thermonuclear
fusion of hydrogen within the stars, certainly accompanied these
heavy elements. But calculations showed that the amount of helium produced in this way was not nearly enough to account for
one-quarter of the Sun’s mass. Because it was thought that the
universe originally contained only hydrogen—the simplest of all
the chemical elements—the presence of so much helium posed a
major dilemma.

proximately 1 millimeter. Hence, this radiation field, which fills all
of space, is called the cosmic microwave background or cosmic
background radiation. In the early 1960s, Dicke and his colleagues
began designing an antenna to detect this microwave radiation.
Meanwhile, just a few miles from Princeton University, Arno
Penzias and Robert Wilson of Bell Telephone Laboratories in
New Jersey were working on a new microwave horn antenna
designed to relay telephone calls
to Earth-orbiting communications The afterglow of the Big
satellites (Figure 26-6). Penzias and Bang was first discovered
Wilson were deeply puzzled when,
by a happy coincidence—
no matter where in the sky they
pointed their antenna, they detected and can be detected with
faint background noise. Thanks to a an ordinary television
colleague, they happened to learn
about the work of Dicke and Peebles and came to realize that they
had discovered the cooled-down cosmic background radiation left
over from the hot Big Bang. Penzias and Wilson shared the 1978
Nobel Prize in Physics for their discovery.
You can actually detect cosmic background radiation using
an ordinary television set. This radiation is responsible for about
1% of the random noise or “hash” that appears on the screen
when you tune a television to a station that is off the air. Using
far more sophisticated detectors than TV sets, scientists have
made many measurements of the intensity of the background radiation at a variety of wavelengths. Unfortunately, the Earth’s atmosphere is almost totally opaque to wavelengths between about
10 ␮m and 1 cm (see Figure 6-25), which is just the wavelength

6.7

Shortly after World War II, Ralph Alpher and Robert Hermann
proposed that the universe immediately following the Big Bang
must have been so incredibly hot that thermonuclear reactions occurred everywhere throughout space. Following up this idea in
1960, Princeton University physicists Robert Dicke and P. J. E.
Peebles discovered that they could indeed account for today’s
high abundance of helium by assuming that the early universe had
been at least as hot as the Sun’s center, where helium is currently
being produced. The hot early universe must therefore have been
filled with many high-energy, short-wavelength photons. The
properties of this radiation field depended on its temperature, as
described by Planck’s blackbody law (review Figure 5-11).
The universe has expanded so much since those ancient times
that all those short-wavelength photons have had their wavelengths stretched by a tremendous factor. As a result, they have
become low-energy, long-wavelength photons. The temperature of
this cosmic radiation field is now only a few degrees above absolute zero. By Wien’s law, radiation at such a low temperature
should have its peak intensity at microwave wavelengths of ap-

create a false signal, Penzias and Wilson realized that they were actually
detecting radiation from space. This radiation is the afterglow of the Big

more nearly isotropic. Because we are moving through this radiation field, however, we see a Doppler shift. Specifically, we see
shorter-than-average wavelengths in the direction toward which
we are moving, as drawn in Figure 26-9. A decrease in wavelength corresponds to an increase in photon energy and thus an

A Detailed Look at the Cosmic Microwave Background
The first high-precision measurements of the cosmic microwave
background came from the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE,
pronounced “coe-bee”) satellite, which was placed in Earth orbit
in 1989 (Figure 26-7a). Data from COBE’s spectrometer, shown
in Figure 26-7b, demonstrate that this ancient radiation has the
spectrum of a blackbody with a temperature of 2.725 K. In recognition of this discovery, as well as others that we will discuss in
Section 26-5, COBE team leaders John Mather of NASA and
George Smoot of the University of California, Berkeley, were
awarded the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physics.
An important feature of the microwave background is that its
intensity is almost perfectly isotropic, that is, the same in all directions. In other words, we detect nearly the same background
intensity from all parts of the sky. This is a striking confirmation
of Einstein’s assumption that the universe is isotropic (see Section
26-2). However, extremely accurate measurements first made
from high-flying airplanes, and later from high-altitude balloons
and from COBE, reveal a very slight variation in temperature
across the sky. The microwave background appears slightly
warmer than average toward the constellation of Leo and slightly
cooler than average in the opposite direction toward Aquarius.
Between the warm spot in Leo and the cool spot in Aquarius, the
background temperature declines smoothly across the sky. Figure
26-8 is a map of the microwave sky showing this variation.
This apparent variation in temperature is caused by the
Earth’s motion through the cosmos. If we were at rest with re-

26-5 The universe was a hot, opaque plasma
during its first 380,000 years
Everything in the universe falls into one of two categories—
energy or matter. One form of energy is radiation, that is, photons. (We will encounter another type of energy in Section 26-7.)
There are many photons of starlight traveling across space, but
the vast majority of photons in the universe belong to the cosmic
microwave background. The matter in the universe is contained
in such luminous objects as stars, planets, and galaxies, as well as
in nonluminous dark matter. A natural question to ask is this:
Which plays a more important role in the universe, radiation or
matter? As we will see, the answer to this question is different for
the early universe from the answer for our universe today.

Radiation and Matter in the Universe
To make a comparison between radiation and matter, recall Einstein’s famous equation E ⫽ mc2 (see Section 16-1). We can think
of the photon energy in the universe (E) as being equal to a quantity of mass (m) multiplied by the square of the speed of light (c).
The amount of this equivalent mass in a volume V, divided by
that volume, is the mass density of radiation (␳rad; say “rho sub
rad”).
We can combine E ⫽ mc2 with the Stefan-Boltzmann law (see
Section 5-4) to give the following formula:
Mass density of radiation

increase in the temperature of the radiation. The slight temperature excess observed, about 0.00337 K, corresponds to a speed of
371 km/s. Conversely, we see longer-than-average wavelengths in
that part of the sky from which we are receding. An increase in
wavelength corresponds to a decline in photon energy and, hence,
a decline in radiation temperature.

Our solar system is thus traveling away from Aquarius
and toward Leo at a speed of 371 km/s. Taking into
account the known velocity of the Sun around the center of our Galaxy, we find that the entire Local Group of galaxies, including our Milky Way Galaxy, is moving at about
620 km/s toward the Hydra-Centaurus supercluster. Observations show that thousands of other galaxies are being carried in
this direction, as is the Hydra-Centaurus supercluster itself. This
tremendous flow of matter is thought to be due to the gravitational pull of an enormous collection of visible galaxies and dark
matter lying in that direction. This immense object, dubbed the
Great Attractor, lies about 50 Mpc (150 million ly) from Earth
(see Figure 24-22).
The existence of such concentrations of mass, as well as the
existence of superclusters of galaxies (see Section 22-6), shows
that the universe is rather “lumpy” on scales of 100 Mpc or
smaller. It is only on larger scales that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic.

␳rad ⫽ 4.6 ⫻ 10⫺31 kg/m3
The average density of matter (␳m; say “rho sub em”) in the
universe is harder to determine. To find this density, we look at
a large volume (V ) of space, determine the total mass (M) of all
the stars, galaxies, and dark matter in that volume, and divide the
volume into the mass: ␳m ⫽ M/V. (We emphasize that this is
the average density of matter. It would be the actual density if all
the matter in the universe were spread out uniformly rather than
being clumped into galaxies and clusters of galaxies.) Determining how much mass is in a large volume of space is a challenging
task. A major part of the challenge involves dark matter, which
emits no electromagnetic radiation and can be detected only by
its gravitational influence (see Section 23-4 and Section 24-8).
One method that appears to deal successfully with this challenge is to observe clusters of galaxies, within which most of the

Chapter 26

mass in the universe is concentrated. Rich clusters are surrounded
by halos of hot, X-ray–emitting gas, typically at temperatures of
107 to 108 K (see Figure 24-25). Such a halo should be in hydrostatic equilibrium, so that it neither expands nor contracts but remains the same size (see Section 16-2, especially Figure 16-2). The
outward gas pressure associated with the halo’s high temperature
would then be balanced by the inward gravitational pull due to
the total mass of the cluster. Thus, by measuring the temperature
of the halo—which can be determined from the properties of the
halo’s X-ray emission—astronomers can infer the cluster’s mass,
including the contribution from dark matter.
From galaxy clusters and other measurements, the presentday average density of matter in the universe is thought to be
␳m ⫽ 2.4 ⫻

10⫺27

kg/m3

with an uncertainty of about 15%. The mass of a single hydrogen atom is 1.67 ⫻ 10⫺27 kg. Hence, if the mass of the universe
were spread uniformly over space, there would be the equivalent
of 11⁄2 hydrogen atoms per cubic meter of space. By contrast,
there are 5 ⫻ 1025 atoms in a cubic meter of the air you breathe!
The very small value of ␳m shows that our universe has very little matter in it.
Furthermore, by counting galaxies and other measurements,
astronomers determine that the average density of luminous matter (that is, the stars and gas within clusters of galaxies) is about
4.2 ⫻ 10–28 kg/m3. This is only about 17% of the average density
of matter of all forms. Thus, nonluminous dark matter is actually
the predominant form of matter in our universe. The “ordinary”
matter of which the stars, the planets, and ourselves are made is
actually very exceptional!

When Radiation Held Sway Over Matter
Although the average density of matter in the universe is tiny by
Earth standards, it is thousands of times larger than ␳rad, the mass
density of radiation. However, this was not always the case. Matter prevails over radiation today only because the energy now carried by microwave photons is so small. Nevertheless, the number
of photons in the microwave background is astounding. From the
physics of blackbody radiation it can be demonstrated that there
are today 410 million (4.1 ⫻ 108) photons in every cubic meter
of space. In other words, the photons in space outnumber atoms
by roughly a billion (109) to one. In terms of total number of particles, the universe thus consists almost entirely of microwave
photons. This radiation field no longer has much “clout,” however, because its photons have been redshifted to long wavelengths and low energies after 13.7 billion years of being stretched
by the expansion of the universe.
In contrast, think back toward the Big Bang. The universe becomes increasingly compressed, and thus the density of matter increases as we go back in time. The photons in the background
radiation also become more crowded together as we go back in
time. But, in addition, the photons become less redshifted and
thus have shorter wavelengths and higher energy than they do today. Because of this added energy, the mass density of radiation
(␳rad) increases more quickly as we go back in time than does the

The Evolution of Density For approximately 24,000 years after the
Big Bang, the mass density of radiation (␳rad, shown in red) exceeded
the matter density (␳m, shown in blue), and the universe was

average density of matter (␳m). In fact, as Figure 26-10 shows,
there was a time in the ancient past when ␳rad equaled ␳m. Before
this time, ␳rad was greater than ␳m, and radiation thus held sway
over matter. Astronomers call this state a radiation-dominated
universe. After ␳m became greater than ␳rad, so that matter prevailed over radiation, our universe became a matter-dominated
universe.
This transition from a radiation-dominated universe to a
matter-dominated universe occurred about 24,000 years after the
Big Bang, at a time that corresponds
to a redshift of about z ⫽ 5200. The temperature of the

To calculate the temperature of the cosmic background radiation at the time of this transition from a radiation-dominated
universe to a matter-dominated one, we use Wien’s law (see
Section 5-4). This law says that the wavelength of maximum
emission (␭max) of a blackbody is inversely proportional to its

abundant element in the universe—hydrogen atoms outnumber

single proton orbited by a single electron, and it takes relatively
little energy to knock the proton and electron apart. In fact, ultraviolet radiation warmer than about 3000 K easily ionizes hydrogen. Thus, hydrogen atoms could not survive in the universe

enough to prevent electrons and protons from binding to form

The Evolution of Radiation Temperature As the universe

expanded, the photons in the radiation background became
increasingly redshifted and the temperature of the radiation fell.
Approximately 380,000 years after the Big Bang, when the temperature
fell below 3000 K, hydrogen atoms formed and the radiation field
“decoupled” from the matter in the universe. After that point, the
temperature of matter in the universe was not the same as the
temperature of radiation. The time when the first atoms formed is called
the era of recombination (see Figure 26-12). (Graph courtesy of Clem Pryke,

to an increase of T by a factor of 2.
The present-day peak wavelength of the cosmic background

In other words, the radiation temperature at redshift z was greater

This means that the temperature of the radiation background was
once much greater and has been declining over the ages, as

variations in the temperature of the radiation field of about
100 ␮K (100 microkelvins, or 10⫺4 K) above or below the average 2.725 K temperature. These tiny temperature variations indicate that the matter and radiation in the universe were not totally
uniform at the moment of recombination. Regions that were
slightly denser than average were also slightly cooler than average; less dense regions were slightly warmer. When radiation decoupled from matter at the time of recombination, the radiation
preserved a record of these variations in temperature and density.
Astronomers place great importance on studying temperature
variations in the cosmic background radiation. The reason is that
concentrations of mass in our present-day universe, such as superclusters of galaxies, are thought to have formed from the
denser regions in the early universe. Within these immense concentrations formed the galaxies, stars, and planets. Thus, by studying these nonuniformities, we are really studying our origins.

not give a detailed picture of these temperature variations. In 1998 two balloon-borne experiments, BOOMERANG
and MAXIMA, carried new, high-resolution telescopes aloft to
study the cosmic background radiation with unprecedented precision. The best all-sky coverage of the background radiation has
come from the state-of-the-art detectors on board the Wilkinson
Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP for short), a NASA spacecraft that was launched in 2001. Shown in Figure 26-13, the
spacecraft is named for the late David Wilkinson of Princeton
University, who was a pioneer in studies of the cosmic background

since t ⫽ 380,000 years) have the energies of these photons been
low enough to permit hydrogen atoms to exist (Figure 26-12b).
The epoch when atoms first formed at t ⫽ 380,000 years is
called the era of recombination. This refers to electrons “recombining” to form atoms. (The name is a bit misleading, because the
electrons and protons had never before combined into atoms.)
Prior to t ⫽ 380,000 years, the universe was completely filled
with a shimmering expanse of high-energy photons colliding vigorously with protons and electrons. This state of matter, called a
plasma, is opaque, just like the glowing gases inside a discharge
tube (like a neon advertising sign). The surface and interior of the
Sun are also a hot, glowing, opaque plasma (see Section 16-9).
P. J. E. Peebles coined the term primordial fireball to describe the
universe during its first 380,000 years of existence.
After t ⫽ 380,000 years, the photons no longer had enough
energy to keep the protons and electrons apart. As soon as the
temperature of the radiation field fell below about 3000 K, protons and electrons began combining to form hydrogen atoms.
These atoms do not absorb low-energy photons, and so space became transparent! All the photons that heretofore had been vigorously colliding with charged particles could now stream
unimpeded across space. Today, these same photons constitute
the microwave background.
Before recombination, matter and the radiation field had the
same temperature, because photons, electrons, and protons were
all in continuous interaction with one another. After recombination, photons and atoms hardly interacted at all, and thus the
temperature of matter in the universe was no longer the same as
the temperature of the background radiation. Thus, T ⫽ 2.725 K
is the temperature of the present-day background radiation field,
not the temperature of the matter in the universe. Note that while
the temperature of the background radiation is very uniform, the
temperature of matter in the universe is anything but: It ranges
from hundreds of millions of kelvins in the interiors of giant stars
to a few tens of kelvins in the interstellar medium.

ANALOGY A good analogy is the behavior of a glass of cold
water. If you hold the glass in your hand, the water will get
warmer and your hand will get colder until both the water and
your hand are at the same temperature. But if you set the glass
down and do not touch it, so that the glass and your hand do
not interact, their temperatures are decoupled: The water will
stay cold and your hand will stay warm for much longer.
Because the universe was opaque prior to t ⫽ 380,000 years,
we cannot see any further into the past than the era of recombination. In particular, we cannot see back to the era when the universe was radiation-dominated. The microwave background,
whose photons have suffered a redshift of z ⫽ 1100, contains the
most ancient photons we will ever be able to observe.

Nonuniformities in the Early Universe

of energy. Thus, by measuring the curvature of space, we should
be able to determine the value of ␳0 and, hence, learn about the
content of the universe as a whole.
To see what astronomers mean by the curvature of the universe, imagine shining two powerful laser beams out into space
so that they are perfectly parallel as they leave the Earth. Furthermore, suppose that nothing gets in the way of these two beams,
so that we can follow them for billions of light-years as they
travel across the universe and across the space whose curvature
we wish to detect. There are only three possibilities:

taken by the WMAP detectors. This map shows us the state of
the universe when it was less than 0.003% of its present age.
Temperature variations in the cosmic background radiation
do more than show us the origins of large-scale structure in the
universe. As we will see in the next two sections, they actually reveal the shape of the universe as a whole.

26-6 The shape of the universe indicates
its matter and energy content
We have seen that by following the mass densities of radiation
(␳rad) and of matter (␳m), we can learn about the evolution of the
universe. But it is equally important to know the combined mass
density of all forms of matter and energy. (In an analogous way,
an accountant needs to know the overall financial status of a
company, not just individual profits or losses.) Remarkably, we
can do this by investigating the overall shape of the universe.

The Curvature of the Universe
Einstein’s general theory of relativity explains that gravity curves
the fabric of space. Furthermore, the equivalence between matter
and energy, expressed by Einstein’s equation E ⫽ mc 2, tells that
either matter or energy produces gravity. Thus, the matter and energy scattered across space should give the universe an overall
curvature. The degree of curvature depends on the combined average mass density of all forms of matter and energy. This quantity, which we call ␳0 (say “rho sub zero”), is the sum of the

1. We might find that our two beams of light remain perfectly
parallel, even after traversing billions of light-years. In this case,
space would not be curved: The universe would have zero
curvature, and space would be flat.
2. Alternatively, we might find that our two beams of light
gradually converge. In such a case, space would not be flat.
Recall that lines of longitude on the Earth’s surface are parallel
at the equator but intersect at the poles. Thus, in this case the
three-dimensional geometry of the universe would be analogous
to the two-dimensional geometry of a spherical surface. We
would then say that space is spherical and that the universe has
positive curvature. Such a universe is also called closed, because
if you travel in a straight line in any direction in such a
universe, you will eventually return to your starting point.
3. Finally, we might find that the two initially parallel beams of
light would gradually diverge, becoming farther and farther
apart as they moved across the universe. In this case, the
universe would still have to be curved, but in the opposite sense
from the spherical model. We would then say that the universe
has negative curvature. In the same way that a sphere is a
positively curved two-dimensional surface, a saddle is a good
example of a negatively curved two-dimensional surface.
Parallel lines drawn on a sphere always converge, but parallel
lines drawn on a saddle always diverge. Mathematicians say
that saddle-shaped surfaces are hyperbolic. Thus, in a negatively
curved universe, we would describe space as hyperbolic. Such a
universe is also called open because if you were to travel in a
straight line in any direction, you would never return to your
starting point.
Figure 26-15 illustrates the three cases of positive curvature,
zero curvature, and negative curvature. Real space is threedimensional, but we have drawn the three cases as analogous,
more easily visualized two-dimensional surfaces. Therefore, as
you examine the drawings in Figure 26-15, remember that the real
universe has one more dimension. For example, if the universe is
in fact hyperbolic, then the geometry of space must be the (difficult to visualize) three-dimensional analog of the two-dimensional
surface of a saddle.
Note that in accordance with the cosmological principle,
none of these models of the universe has an “edge” or a “center.”
This is clearly the case for both the flat and hyperbolic universes,
because they are infinite and extend forever in all directions. A
spherical universe is finite, but it also lacks a center and an edge.

universe is either (a) positive, (b) zero, or (c) negative. The
curvature depends on whether the combined mass density is greater
than, equal to, or less than the critical density, or, equivalently, on
whether the density parameter ⍀0 is greater than, equal to, or less than 1.
In theory, the curvature could be determined by seeing whether two laser
beams initially parallel to each other would converge, remain parallel, or
spread apart.

You could walk forever around the surface of a sphere (like the
surface of the Earth) without finding a center or an edge.
The curvature of the universe is determined by the value of
the combined mass density ␳0. If ␳0 is greater than a certain value
␳c (say “rho sub cee”), the universe has positive curvature and is
closed. If ␳0 is less than ␳c, the universe has negative curvature
and is open. In the special case that ␳0 is exactly equal to ␳c, the
universe is flat. Because of its crucial role in determining the
geometry of the universe, ␳c is called the critical density. It is given
by the expression

⍀0 ⫽ density parameter
␳0 ⫽ combined average mass density
␳c ⫽ critical density
An open universe has a density parameter ⍀0 between 0 and
1, and a closed universe has ⍀0 greater than 1. In a flat universe,
⍀0 is equal to 1. Thus, we can use the value of ⍀0 as a measure
of the curvature of the universe (Table 26-1).

Measuring the Cosmic Curvature
How can we determine the curvature of space across the universe? In theory, if you drew an enormous triangle whose sides
were each a billion light-years long (see Figure 26-15), you could
determine the curvature of space by measuring the three angles of
the triangle. If their sum equaled 180°, space would be flat. If the
sum was greater than 180°, space would be spherical. And if the
sum of the three angles was less than 180°, space would be hyperbolic. Unfortunately, this direct method for measuring the curvature of space is not practical.

tainty of about 2%. In other words, ␳0 is within 2% of the critical density ␳c.
The flatness of the universe poses a major dilemma. We saw
in Section 26-5 that the average mass density of matter in the universe, ␳m, is 2.4 ⫻ 10⫺27 kg/m3. This is only 0.24 of the critical
density ␳c. We can express this in terms of the matter density parameter ⍀m (say “omega sub em”), equal to the ratio of ␳m to the
critical density:
⍀m ⫽

If matter and radiation were all there is in the universe, the
combined average mass density ␳0 would be equal to ␳m (plus a
tiny contribution from radiation, which we can neglect because
the average mass density of radiation is only about 0.02% that of
matter). Then the density parameter ⍀0 would be equal to ⍀m—
that is, equal to 0.24—and the universe would be open. But the
temperature variations in the cosmic microwave background
clearly show that the universe is either flat or very nearly so.
These variations also show that the density parameter ⍀0, which
includes the effects of all kinds of matter and energy, is equal to
1.0. In other words, radiation and matter, including dark matter,
together account for only 24% of the total density of the universe! The dilemma is this: What could account for the rest?

A way to determine the curvature of the universe that is both
practical and precise is to see if light rays bend toward or away
from each other, as shown in Figure 26-15. The greater the distance a pair of light rays has traveled, and, hence, the longer the
time the light has been in flight, the more pronounced any such
bending should be. Therefore, astronomers test for the presence
of such bending by examining the oldest radiation in the universe:
the cosmic microwave background.
If the cosmic microwave background were truly isotropic, so
that equal amounts of radiation reached us from all directions in
the sky, it would be impossible to tell whether individual light
rays have been bent. However, as we saw in Section 26-5, there
are localized “hot spots” in the cosmic microwave background
due to density variations in the early universe. The apparent size
of these hot spots depends on the curvature of the universe
(Figure 26-16). If the universe is closed, the bending of light rays
from a hot spot will make the spot appear larger (Figure 26-16a);
if the universe is open, the light rays will bend the other way and
the hot spots will appear smaller (Figure 26-16c). Only in a flat
universe will the light rays travel along straight lines, so that the
hot spots appear with their true size (Figure 26-16b).
By calculating what conditions were like in the primordial
fireball, astrophysicists find that in a flat universe, the dominant
“hot spots” in the cosmic background radiation should have an
angular size of about 1°. (In Section 26-9 we will learn how this
is deduced.) This is just what the BOOMERANG and MAXIMA
experiments observed, and what the WMAP observations have
confirmed (see Figure 26-14). Hence, the curvature of the universe must be very close to zero, and the universe must either be
flat or very nearly so.
As Table 26-1 shows, once we know the curvature of the universe, we can determine the density parameter ⍀0 and hence the
combined average mass density ␳0. By analyzing the data shown
in Figure 26-14, astrophysicists find that ⍀0 ⫽ 1.0 with an uncer-

Chapter 26

Just as we express the average density of matter and radiation by the matter density parameter ⍀m, we can express the average density of dark energy in terms of the dark energy density
parameter ⍀⌳ (say “omega sub lambda”). This is equal to the average mass density of dark energy, ␳⌳, divided by the critical density ␳c:
␳⌳
⍀⌳ ⫽ ᎏ
␳c
We can determine the value of ⍀⌳ by noting that the combined average mass density ␳0 must be the sum of the average
mass densities of matter, radiation, and dark energy. As we have
seen, the contribution of radiation is so small that we can ignore
it, so we have
␳0 ⫽ ␳m ⫹ ␳⌳
If we divide this through by the critical density ␳c, we obtain
⍀0 ⫽ ⍀m ⫹ ⍀⌳
That is, the density parameter ⍀0 is the sum of the matter
density parameter ⍀m and the dark energy density parameter ⍀⌳.
Solving for ⍀⌳, we find
⍀⌳ ⫽ ⍀0 ⫺ ⍀m
Since ⍀0 is close to 1.0 and ⍀m is 0.24, we conclude that ⍀⌳
must be 1.0 ⫺ 0.24 ⫽ 0.76. Thus, whatever dark energy is, it accounts for 76% (about three-quarters) of the contents of the
universe!
The concept of dark energy is actually due to Einstein. When
he proposed the existence of a cosmological constant, he was suggesting that the universe is filled with a form of energy that by itself tends to make the universe expand (see Section 26-1). Unlike
gravity, which tends to make objects attract, the energy associated with a cosmological constant would provide a form of “antigravity.” Hence, it would not be detected in the same way as
matter. (The subscript ⌳ in the symbol for the dark energy density parameter pays homage to the symbol that Einstein chose for
the cosmological constant.)
If dark energy is in fact due to a cosmological constant, the
value of this constant must be far larger than Einstein suggested.
This is needed if we are to explain why ⍀⌳ has a large value of
0.76. If Einstein felt he erred by introducing the idea of a cosmological constant, his error was giving it too small a value!
These ideas concerning dark energy are extraordinary, and extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence to confirm them.
As we will see in the next section, a crucial test is to examine how
the rate of expansion of the universe has evolved over the eons.

26-7 Observations of distant supernovae
reveal that we live in an accelerating universe
We have seen that the universe is expanding. But does the rate of
expansion stay the same? Because there is matter in the universe,
and because gravity tends to pull the bits of matter in the universe

toward one another, we would expect that the expansion should
slow down with time. (In the same way, a cannonball shot upward from the surface of the Earth will slow down as it ascends
because of the Earth’s gravitational pull.) If there is a cosmological constant, however, its associated dark energy will exert an
outward pressure that tends to accelerate the expansion. Which
of these effects is more important?

Modeling the Expansion History of the Universe
To answer this question, astronomers study the relationship between redshift and distance for extremely remote galaxies. We see
these galaxies as they were billions of years ago. If the rate of expansion was the same in the distant past as it is now, the same
Hubble law should apply to distant galaxies as to nearby ones.
But if the rate of expansion has either increased or decreased, we
will find important deviations from the Hubble law.
To see how astronomers approach this problem, first imagine two different parallel universes. Both Universe #1 and Universe #2 are expanding at constant rates, so for both universes
there is a direct proportion between recessional velocity v and distance d as expressed by the Hubble law v ⫽ H0d. Hence, a graph
of distance versus recessional velocity for either universe is a
straight line, as Figure 26-17a shows. The only difference is that
Universe #1 is expanding at a slower rate than Universe #2.
Hence, a galaxy at a certain distance from Earth in Universe #1
will have a slower recessional velocity than a galaxy at the same
distance from Earth in Universe #2. As a result, the graph of distance versus recessional velocity for slowly expanding Universe #1
(shown in blue) has a steeper slope than the graph for rapidly expanding Universe #2 (shown in green). Keep this observation in
mind: A slower expansion means a steeper slope on a graph of
distance versus recessional velocity.
Now consider our universe and allow for the possibility that
the expansion rate may change over time. If we observe very remote galaxies, we are seeing them as they were in the remote past.
If the expansion of the universe in the remote past was slower or
faster than it is now, the slope of the graph of distance versus recessional velocity will be different for those remote galaxies. If the
expansion was slower, then the slope will be steeper for distant
galaxies (shown in blue in Figure 26-17b); if the expansion was
faster, the slope will be shallower for distant galaxies (shown in
green in Figure 26-17b). In either case, there will be a deviation
from the straight-line Hubble law (shown in red in Figure
26-17b).

Measuring Ancient Expansion with Type Ia Supernovae
Which of the possibilities shown in Figure 26-17b represents the
actual history of the expansion of our universe? In Section 24-5
we looked at the observed relationship between distance and recessional velocity for galaxies. Figure 24-17 is a plot of some representative data. The data points appear to lie along a straight
line, suggesting that the rate of cosmological expansion has not
changed. (Figure 24-17 is actually a graph of recessional velocity
versus distance, not the other way around. But a straight line
on one kind of graph will be a straight line on the other, because
in either case there is a direct proportion between the two quantities being graphed.) However, the graph in Figure 24-17 was
based on measurements of galaxies no farther than 400 Mpc

In 1998, two large research groups—the Supernova
Cosmology Project, led by Saul Perlmutter of Lawrence
Berkeley National Laboratory, and the High-Z Supernova Search Team, led by Brian Schmidt of the Mount Stromlo
and Siding Springs Observatories in Australia—reported their results from a survey of Type Ia supernovae in galaxies at redshifts
of 0.2 or greater, corresponding to distances beyond 750 Mpc
(2.4 billion ly). Figure 26-18 shows some of their data, along with
more recent observations, on a graph of apparent magnitude versus redshift. A greater apparent magnitude corresponds to a dimmer supernova (see Section 17-3), which means that the supernova
is more distant. A greater redshift implies a greater recessional velocity. Hence, this graph is basically the same as those in Figure
26-17.
To interpret these results, we need guidance from relativistic
cosmology. This is a theoretical description of the universe and
its expansion, based on Einstein’s general theory of relativity and
developed in the 1920s by Alexander Friedmann in Russia,
Georges Lemaître in France, and Willem de Sitter in the Netherlands. Given values of the mass density parameter ⍀m and the
dark energy density parameter ⍀⌳, cosmologists can use the equations of relativistic cosmology to predict how the expansion rate
of the universe should change over time. Such predictions can be
expressed as curves on a graph of distance versus redshift such as
Figure 26-18.

(1.3 billion ly) from the Earth, which means we are looking only
1.3 billion years into the past. The straightness of the line in
Figure 24-17 means only that the expansion of the universe has
been relatively constant over the past 1.3 billion years—only 10%
of the age of the universe, and a relatively brief interval on the
cosmic scale.
Now suppose that you were to measure the redshifts and distances of galaxies several billion light-years from the Earth. The
light from these galaxies has taken billions of years to arrive at
your telescope, so your measurements will reveal how fast the
universe was expanding billions of years ago. To do this, we need
a technique that will allow us to find the distances to these very
remote galaxies. We saw in Section 24-4 that one way to do this
is to identify Type Ia supernovae in such galaxies. These supernovae are among the most luminous objects in the universe, and
hence can be detected even at extremely large distances (see
Figure 24-14). The maximum brightness of a supernova tells astronomers its distance through the inverse-square law for light,
and the redshift of the supernova’s spectrum tells them its recessional velocity. As an example, the image that opens this chapter
shows Type Ia supernovae with redshifts z ⫽ 1.010, 1.230, and
1.390, corresponding to recessional velocities of 60%, 67%, and
70% of the speed of light. We see these supernovae as they were
7.7 to 9.0 billion years ago, when the universe was less than half
of its present age.

expansion of our universe was more rapid in the distant past,
corresponding to remote distances, the graph of d versus v will have a
shallower slope for large distances (green curve). If the expansion rate
was slower in the distant past, the graph will have a steeper slope for
large distances (blue curve).

tell us about the difference between the values of the dark energy
density parameter ⍀⌳ and the matter density parameter ⍀m. By
contrast, measurements of the cosmic microwave background
(Section 26-6) give information about ⍀0, equal to the sum of
⍀⌳ and ⍀m. Observations of galaxy clusters (Section 26-5) set
limits on the value of ⍀m by itself. By combining these three very
different kinds of observations as shown in Figure 26-19, we can
set more stringent limits on both ⍀⌳ and ⍀m.
Taken together and combined with other observations, all

is in fact speeding up. (The Supernova Cosmology Project/R. A. Knop et al.)

As Figure 26-20 shows, the dominance of
dark energy is a relatively recent development in the history of the universe. Prior to
about 5 billion years ago, the density of matter should have been
greater than that of dark energy. Hence, we would expect that up
until about 5 billion years ago, the expansion of the universe
should have been slowing down rather than speeding up. Recently, astronomers have found evidence of this picture by using
the Hubble Space Telescope to observe extremely distant Type Ia
supernovae with redshifts z greater than 1. (The image that opens
this chapter shows three of these supernovae.) When astronomers
compare the distance to these supernovae (determined from their
brightness) to their redshifts, they find that the redshifts are
greater than would be the case if the expansion of the universe
had always been at the same rate or had always been speeding

The lower, gray curve in Figure 26-18 shows what would be
expected in a flat universe with ⍀0 ⫽ 1.00 but with no dark energy, so that ⍀⌳ ⫽ 0 and ⍀m ⫽ ⍀0 (that is, the density parameter
is due to matter and radiation alone). In this model, and in fact
in any model whose curve lies in the red area in Figure 26-18, the
absence of dark energy means that gravitational attraction between galaxies would cause the expansion of the universe to slow
down with time. Hence, the expansion rate would have been
greater in the past (compare with the green curve in Figure
26-17b).
In fact, the data points in Figure 26-18 are almost all in the
blue region of the graph, and agree very well with the curve
shown in black. This curve also assumes a flat universe, but with
an amount of dark energy consistent with the results from the
cosmic microwave background (⍀m ⫽ 0.24, ⍀⌳ ⫽ 0.76, ⍀0 ⫽
⍀m ⫹ ⍀⌳ ⫽ 1.00). In this model, and indeed in any model whose
curve lies in the blue region of Figure 26-18, dark energy has
made the expansion of the universe speed up over time. Hence,
the expansion of the universe was slower in the distant past,
which means that we live in an accelerating universe.
Just like the blue curve in Figure 26-17b, the data in Figure
26-18 show that supernovae of a certain brightness (and hence a
given distance) have smaller redshifts (and hence smaller recessional
velocities) than would be the case if the expansion rate had always
been the same. These data provide compelling evidence of the existence of dark energy. (Professor Robert Kirshner’s essay following this chapter discusses more about this remarkable discovery.)
Roughly speaking, the data in Figure 26-18 indicate the relative importance of dark energy (which tends to make the expan-

In each case, the number after the ⫾ sign is the uncertainty in the

This collection of numbers points to a radically different
model of the universe from what was
suspected just a few years ago. In Dark energy became the
the 1980s there was no compelling
dominant form of energy
evidence for an accelerating expansion of the universe, so it was widely in the universe about the

The model we are left with is one in which the universe is
suffused with a curious dark energy due to a cosmological constant. Unlike matter or radiation, whose average densities decrease as the universe expands and thins out, the average density
of this dark energy remains constant throughout the history of the
universe (Figure 26-20). The dark energy was relatively unimportant over most of the early history of the universe. Today, however, the density of dark energy is greater than that of matter (⍀⌳
is greater than ⍀m). In other words, we live in a dark-energydominated universe.

ANALOGY If you see a red light up ahead while driving, you
would probably apply the brakes to make the car slow down.
But if the light then turns green before your car comes to a stop,
and the road ahead is clear, you would step on the gas to make
the car speed up again. The expansion of the universe has had
a similar history. The mutual gravitational attraction of all the
matter in the universe means that “the brakes were on” for
about the first 9 billion years after the Big Bang, so that the expansion slowed down. But for about the past 5 billion years,
dark energy has “had its foot on the gas,” and the expansion
has been speeding up.
If dark energy truly is a cosmological constant, the density of
dark energy will continue to remain constant, as shown in Figure
26-20. Due to the effects of this dark energy, the universe will
keep on expanding forever, and the rate of expansion will continue to accelerate. Eventually, some 30 billion years from now,
the universe will have expanded so much that only a thousand or
so of the nearest galaxies will still be visible. The billions of other

The three regions on this graph show
values of the mass density parameter
⍀m and the dark energy density parameter ⍀⌳ that

Galaxy cluster measurements (in brown) set limits on

and ⍀⌳: A larger value of ⍀m (to the right in the

this band slopes downward. Observations of Type Ia
supernovae (in blue) set limits on the difference
between ⍀m and ⍀⌳; this band slopes upward since a
larger value of ⍀m implies a larger value of ⍀⌳ to
keep the difference the same. The best agreement to

matter, ␳m, and the average mass density of radiation, ␳rad, both decrease
as the universe expands and becomes more tenuous. But if the dark
energy is due to a cosmological constant, its average mass density ␳⌳
remains constant. In this model, our universe became dominated by dark
energy about 5 billion years ago.

galaxies that we can observe today will have moved so far away
from us that their light will have faded to invisibility. Furthermore, they will be moving away from us so rapidly that what
light we do receive from them will have been redshifted out of the
visible range.

There may be other explanations for dark energy besides a cosmological constant, however. Several physicists have proposed a type of dark energy whose density
decreases slowly as the universe expands. Depending on how the
density of dark energy evolves over time, the universe could continue to expand or could eventually recollapse on itself. Future
observations, including space-based measurements of both the
cosmic background radiation and of Type Ia supernovae, should
help resolve the nature of the mysterious dark energy.

26-8 Primordial sound waves help reveal
the character of the universe
We have seen how studying the “hot spots” in the cosmic background radiation reveals that we live in a flat universe. In fact,
temperature variations reveal more: They give us a window on
conditions in the early universe, and actually help us pin down
the values of other important quantities such as the Hubble constant and the density of matter in the universe. The key to extracting this additional information from the cosmic background
radiation is recognizing that the hot and cold spots in a map such
as Figure 26-14 are actually sound waves.

Sound Waves in the Early Universe
Sound waves can travel in fluids of all kinds. Sound waves in air
are used in human speech and hearing, while whales communicate using high-frequency underwater clicks and whistles. If you
could take a snapshot of a sound wave, you would see that at any
moment there are some regions, called compressions, where the
fluid is squeezed together, and other regions, called rarefactions,
where the fluid is thinned out or
rarefied. (When a sound wave enters Immense sound waves in
a human ear, the air next to the
the early universe left
eardrum is alternately compressed
and rarefied, which makes the their imprint as
eardrum flex back and forth. The variations in the cosmic
ear detects this flexing and translates microwave background
it into an electrical signal that is sent
to the brain.) Even a seemingly quiet fluid, such as the still air inside a room, has sound waves in it that are triggered by random
motions of the fluid. Such random sounds in still air are too faint
to be detected by your ear. This is a good thing; it would be very
annoying to hear a continuous background noise from the air!
LINK 26

WEB

.15

There would also have been sound waves in the early
universe before recombination. During the first
380,000 years after the Big Bang, the universe was
filled with a fluid composed primarily of photons, electrons, and
protons, with a density more than 109 times greater than that of
our present-day universe. Just as water molecules in a glass of wa-

ter collide with each other, photons and particles collided frequently with each other in this primordial fluid, triggering random sound waves with compressions and rarefactions.
Because there was more mass in a compression than in a rarefaction, photons emerging from a compression experienced a
greater gravitational redshift than did photons emerging from a
rarefaction (see Section 22-2). As a result, while the light we see
from either a compression or a rarefaction has a blackbody spectrum, the light from a compression is shifted to slightly longer
wavelengths. We saw in Sections 5-3 and 5-4 that a blackbody
spectrum dominated by longer wavelengths corresponds to a
lower blackbody temperature (see Figure 5-11). Hence, we see
compressions as the cold spots in Figure 26-14, and we see rarefactions as the hot spots. The overall pattern of cold and hot
spots is thus a record of the sound waves that were present just
as the universe became transparent, some 380,000 years after the
Big Bang. As we discussed in Section 26-5, from the cold compressions arose our present-day population of galaxies.
The nature of a sound wave depends on the material through
which it passes. For example, sound waves travel faster in helium
than they do in air (because helium is less dense) and faster still
in water (which, while denser than air, is much more resistant to
compression). So by studying the primordial sound waves recorded
in Figure 26-14, we can learn about the properties of the fluid
that made up the early universe. These properties include the average densities of matter and dark energy in the fluid, as well as
the value of the Hubble constant (which helps determine how
rapidly the fluid was expanding and thinning out as the universe
expanded). We can also determine the age of the universe at the
time that the cosmic background radiation was emitted, since this
determines the maximum size to which a hot spot (rarefaction) or
cold spot (compression) could have grown since the Big Bang.
Figure 26-21 shows an important way in which astronomers
systematize their data about hot and cold spots in the cosmic
background radiation. This graph shows the number of observed
hot or cold spots of different angular sizes, with larger spots on
the left and smaller spots on the right. The presence of peaks in
the graph shows that spots of certain sizes are more common than
others. The largest peak tells us that the predominant angular size
is about 1°, which corresponds to a region of compression or rarefaction that was about a million (106) light-years across at the
time of recombination at z ⫽ 1100. (By contrast, the compressions and rarefactions in the sound waves most used in speech are
a few meters across.) Since then the universe has expanded by a
factor of about 1100, so that same region is now about a billion
(109) light-years across.
Different cosmological models predict different shapes for the
curve shown in Figure 26-21. Astronomers determine the best
model by seeing which one gives a curve that best fits the data
points. For example, the peak of the curve at an angular size of
1° is just what would be expected for a flat universe with ⍀0 ⫽ 1.
Table 26-2 summarizes the results of a flat-universe model that
yields the particular curve shown in Figure 26-21.

Polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background

light in the cosmic microwave background. Ordinary light from

Sound Waves in the Early Universe Observations of the cosmic

observations helps to constrain the values of important cosmological
parameters. Most of the data shown here is from the Wilkinson
Microwave Anisotropy Probe; the data for the smallest angles (at the right

direction. (As an example, the electric fields in sunlight reflected
from the ground are mostly oriented horizontally. Polarizing sunglasses work by screening out electric fields of this orientation
only, which helps eliminate distracting reflections.) In a similar
way, the cosmic background radiation acquires a polarization
when it scatters from material in a large hot spot. The amount of
polarization turns out to be a very sensitive probe of conditions
in the early universe, and, hence, of the nature of the universe
itself.
In 2002 astronomers using the DASI microwave telescope at
the South Pole reported the first detection of polarized light in the
cosmic background radiation. Measurements made with the
Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe have since provided additional information about polarization. Such measurements are
very challenging to do. But the rewards for cosmology are very
great, which is why researchers are devoting great effort to further studies of the polarization of the background radiation.
Our understanding of the universe as a whole has increased
tremendously over the past several years. We have found compelling evidence that dark energy exists, and that it is the dominant form of energy in the universe. Studies of supernovae, galaxy
clusters, and the cosmic background radiation have provided us
with so much high-quality data that we can now express the key
parameters of the universe (Table 26-2) with very high accuracy.
When we look back to the situation in the 1980s, when the value
of the Hubble constant was uncertain by at least 50%, it is no
exaggeration to say that we have entered an age of precision
cosmology.
Yet many questions remain unanswered. What is the nature
of dark matter? What actually is dark energy? Can these mysterious entities be detected and studied in the laboratory? These and
other questions will continue to occupy cosmologists for many
years to come.

Key Ideas
The Expansion of the Universe: The Hubble law describes the
continuing expansion of space. The redshifts that we see from distant galaxies are caused by this expansion, not by the motions of
galaxies through space.
• The redshift of a distant galaxy is a measure of the scale of the
universe at the time the galaxy emitted its light.
• It is meaningless to speak of an edge or center to the universe
or of what lies beyond the universe.
The Cosmological Principle: Cosmological theories are based on
the idea that on large scales, the universe looks the same at all locations and in every direction.
The Big Bang: The universe began as an infinitely dense cosmic
singularity that began its expansion in the event called the Big
Bang, which can be described as the beginning of time.
• The observable universe extends about 14 billion light-years in
every direction from the Earth. We cannot see objects beyond this
distance because light from these objects has not had enough time
to reach us.
• During the first 10⫺43 second after the Big Bang, the universe
was too dense to be described by the known laws of physics.
Cosmic Background Radiation and the Evolution of the Universe:
The cosmic microwave background radiation, corresponding to
radiation from a blackbody at a temperature of nearly 3 K, is the
greatly redshifted remnant of the hot universe as it existed about
380,000 years after the Big Bang.

• The background radiation was hotter and more intense in the
past. During the first 380,000 years of the universe, radiation and
matter formed an opaque plasma called the primordial fireball.
When the temperature of the radiation fell below 3000 K, protons and electrons could combine to form hydrogen atoms and
the universe became transparent.
• The abundance of helium in the universe is explained by the
high temperatures in its early history.
The Geometry of the Universe: The curvature of the universe as
a whole depends on how the combined average mass density ␳0
compares to a critical density ␳c.
• If ␳0 is greater than ␳c, the density parameter ⍀0 has a value
greater than 1, the universe is closed, and space is spherical (with
positive curvature).
• If ␳0 is less than ␳c, the density parameter ⍀0 has a value less
than 1, the universe is open, and space is hyperbolic (with negative curvature).
• If ␳0 is equal to ␳c, the density parameter ⍀0 is equal to 1 and
space is flat (with zero curvature).
Cosmological Parameters and Dark Energy: Observations of temperature variations in the cosmic microwave background indicate
that the universe is flat or nearly so, with a combined average
mass density equal to the critical density. Observations of galaxy
clusters suggest that the average density of matter in the universe
is about 0.24 of the critical density. The remaining contribution
to the average density is called dark energy.
• Measurements of Type Ia supernovae in distant galaxies show
that the expansion of the universe is speeding up. This may be
due to the presence of dark energy in the form of a cosmological
constant, which provides a pressure that pushes the universe
outward.
Cosmological Parameters and Primordial Sound Waves: Temperature variations in the cosmic background radiation are a record
of sound waves in the early universe. Studying the character of
these sound waves, and the polarization of the background radiation that they produce, helps constrain models of the universe.

seemed possible that we might be living in a “steady-state
universe” with overall properties that do not change with
time. The steady-state model, like the Big Bang model, assumes an expanding universe, but does not assume a “creation event.” Instead, matter is assumed to be created
continuously everywhere in space to ensure that the average
density of the universe remains constant. Search the World

was a fatal blow to the steady-state theory.

The Extravagant Universe
Robert Kirshner
xploding stars halfway across the observable universe reveal a surprising fact. Judging the distances to distant supernovae from their apparent brightness, the rate of
cosmic expansion has been speeding up in the last 5 billion
years. While gravitation acts to slow cosmic expansion, these
observations require something else to make the universe accelerate. We call this the “dark energy,” though, in truth, we
do not know what it is. Perhaps it is the modern version of
Einstein’s notorious cosmological constant.
This result was a big surprise to people working on the
problem. Early in 1998, I wrote an e-mail to the members of

E

Robert Kirshner is Harvard College Professor and

Massachusetts, in 1949, he obtained his A.B. degree
from Harvard College in 1970 and his Ph.D. from the California
Institute of Technology in 1975. Kirshner was elected to the
National Academy of Science in 1998 and elected president of the
American Astronomical Society in 2003. At Harvard, he teaches a
large course for students who are not science concentrators,
entitled “The Energetic Universe.” He is also master of Quincy

Accelerating Cosmos.

our High-Z Supernova Team, saying, “In your heart you know
this is wrong, though your head tells you [that] you don’t care
and you’re just reporting the observations.” One reason for
our reluctance was a contrary result. The Supernova Cosmology Project, based at the Lawrence Berkeley Lab, had published a paper in the Astrophysical Journal in July 1997
claiming that distant supernovae showed the universe was
slowing down. Our methods weren’t that different, but our results were pointing the other way. We couldn’t both be right.
Another reason to be wary was Einstein’s bad experience
with this idea, invented to make a static universe. Did we think
we were smarter than Einstein? Einstein never liked the cosmological constant, as he wrote, “I am unable to believe that such
an ugly thing should be realized in nature.” It became a kind
of theoretical poison ivy, touched only by the unwary for about
65 years. But the data were leading us to reconsider. As my fellow team member Adam Riess wrote to the rest of us, “Approach these results not with your heart or your head, but with
your eyes. We are observers, after all!”
By 1998, both teams saw the signature of cosmic acceleration in supernovae at redshift 0.5: light that had been en route
for about 5 billion years. Now we’re using the Hubble Space
Telescope to search for even fainter and more distant supernovae at redshift 1.5, roughly 9 billion light-years away, where
we see signs of deceleration caused by denser dark matter that
was winning the cosmic tug-of-war in the early history of cosmic expansion.

Cosmology: The Origin and Evolution of the Universe

Technology is a lot better now than it was just a decade
ago: We’ve trained faster computers to scan bigger megapixel
digital images of galaxies for us, to pick out the objects that
change from one night to the next, and to pop out a list of supernova candidates just hours after we take the images. Speed
is important because supernovae are like fish—after a few
days, they lose their freshness. If you want to see the peak of
a distant supernova’s light curve, prompt action is essential.
Energetic supernova observations by us and by others have
strengthened the case for an accelerating universe by measuring the distance and the redshift to hundreds of new objects,
both near and far. Converging lines of evidence from other directions, including measurements of galaxy clustering and ripples in the glow from the Big Bang, all point to the same
strange picture of a runaway universe that is ⬃70% dark energy, 25% dark matter, with just a few percent of the universe
made of ordinary neutrons and protons, like the Galaxy, the
Sun, the Earth, and ourselves.
In the future, telescopes scanning the whole sky and specialized satellites will give us a better chance to pin down the
nature of the dark energy. Is it really Einstein’s cosmological
constant, retrieved from the dumpster of history, smoothed out
and made new again? Or is it some more general “quintessence” whose energy density changes over time? We’re doing
better measurements to show whether the dark energy is constant, or changes subtly as the universe expands. Either way
will be very interesting. So far, everything is consistent with a

719

cosmological constant, but we should be ready for surprises
ahead. The dark energy is important because it points to a
deep mystery right at the heart of physics—the thorny problem of connecting gravitation with the quantum world. Will
the solution come from string theory, extra dimensions of
space, or from modifications to Einstein’s general relativity?
We don’t know, and at this moment, only astronomical observations can shed light on the dark energy.
Faint light from distant stellar catastrophes traces the history of cosmic expansion. It is not what we expected to see.
The universe contains more parts than the simplest universe we
could imagine: atoms that glow, atoms that don’t, neutrinos
with mass, and another dark matter particle with more mass,
something that made the universe expand exponentially in the
era of inflation, and something more that is now making the
universe accelerate. Perhaps some day in the future all of this
will seem essential, but at the moment, it seems we live in a
recklessly extravagant universe, with extra parts whose function we do not yet fathom.
When people ask what science is for, the answer is often
framed in terms of economic development, or national security, or improved life span. Nobody is against being rich, or
safe, or healthy, but there is something deeper at work when
we study how the universe began and where we are going. This
is research we do for the joy of finding out how the world
works.

Chapter 27

The Isotropy Problem: Why Is the Microwave
Background So Uniform?
To appreciate why the uniformity of the microwave background
poses a problem, think about two opposite parts of the sky, labeled A and B in Figure 27-1. Both of these points lie on a sphere
centered on the Earth, called our cosmic light horizon (see Section
26-3, especially Figure 26-5). We can see light coming from any
object on or inside our cosmic light horizon, but we cannot yet
see objects beyond this horizon. Even traveling at the speed of
light—the ultimate speed limit—no information of any kind from
objects beyond our cosmic light horizon has had time to reach us
over the entire 13.7-billion-year history of the universe. Thus, the
cosmic light horizon defines the limits of our observable universe.
(As time passes, our cosmic light horizon expands, so eventually
we will receive light from objects that are beyond the present-day
horizon.)
Points A and B in Figure 27-1 lie just on our cosmic light
horizon, so when we look at these points we are seeing as far
back into the past as possible—that is, the light we see from these
points is the cosmic background radiation. In order for the radiation that reaches us from A and B to be nearly the same, the
material of the early universe at A must have had the same temperature as at B. But for two objects to be at the same tempera-

The Isotropy Problem Regions A and B, both of which lie on our cosmic
light horizon, are so far apart that they seem never to have been in
communication over the lifetime of the universe. Yet the cosmic
background radiation from A and B, and from all other parts of the sky,
shows that these disconnected regions have almost exactly the same
temperature. The dilemma of why this should be is called the isotropy
problem.

ture, they should have been in contact and able to exchange heat
with each other. (A hot cup of coffee and a cold spoonful of
cream reach the same temperature only after you pour the cream
into the coffee.)
The problem is that the widely separated regions at A and B
have absolutely no connection with each other. As Figure 27-1
shows, point A lies outside the cosmic light horizon for point B,
and point B lies outside the cosmic light horizon for point A. (Put
another way, point A lies outside the observable universe of point
B and vice versa.) Hence, no information has had time to travel
between points A and B over the entire history of the universe.
How is it possible, then, that these unrelated parts of the universe
have almost exactly the same temperature? This dilemma is called
the isotropy problem or the horizon problem.

The Flatness Problem: Why Is ⍀0 ⫽ 1?
The flatness of our universe presents us with a second enigma.
Recall that the geometry of our universe depends on the density
parameter ⍀0, which is the ratio of the combined average mass
density in the universe (␳0) to the critical density (␳c) (see Section
26-6). Observations of temperature variations in the cosmic microwave background indicate that ⍀0 is very close to 1, which
corresponds to a flat universe.
For the density parameter ⍀0 to be close to 1 today, it must
have been extremely close to 1 during the Big Bang. In other
words, the density of the early universe was almost exactly equal
to the critical density. (The density was much higher than it is today, but the value of the critical density was also much higher. In
a flat universe, the average mass density and the critical density
decrease together as the universe expands, so that they remain
equal at all times.)
The equations for an expanding universe show that any deviation from exact equality would have mushroomed within a
fraction of a second. Had the average mass density been slightly
less than ␳c, the universe would have expanded so rapidly that
matter could never have clumped together to form galaxies. Without galaxies, there would be no stars or planets, and humans
would never have evolved. If, on the other hand, the density had
been slightly greater than ␳c, the universe would soon have become tightly packed with matter. Had this been the case, the gravitational attraction of this matter would long ago have collapsed
the entire cosmos in a reversed Big Bang or “Big Crunch,” and
again humans would never have evolved.
In other words, immediately after the Big Bang the fate of the
universe hung in the balance. The tiniest deviation from the precise equality ␳0 ⫽ ␳c would have rapidly propelled the universe
away from the special case of ⍀0 ⫽ 1. Had there been such a deviation, we would not be here to contemplate the nature of the
universe.
Happily, our universe is one in which galaxies, stars, planets,
and humans do exist, the Big Crunch has not taken place, and ⍀0
is close to 1. This tells us that the density of the universe immediately after the Big Bang must have been equal to the critical density to an incredibly high order of precision. In order for space to
be as flat as it is today, the value of ␳0 right after the Big Bang
must have been equal to ␳c to more than 50 decimal places!

Solving the Problems: The Inflationary Model
INK 2

7.2

In the early 1980s, a remarkable solution was proposed to both the isotropy problem and the flatness
problem. Working independently, Alexei Starobinsky
at the L. D. Landau Institute of Theoretical Physics in Moscow
and Alan Guth at Stanford University suggested that the universe
might have experienced a brief period of inflation, or extremely
rapid expansion, shortly after the Planck time. (As we saw in

WE

in red), the universe expanded by a factor of about
1050 shortly after the Big Bang. This growth in the size
of the present-day observable universe—that portion
of the universe that lies within our present cosmic
light horizon—occurred during a very brief interval,
as indicated by the vertical shaded area on the
graph. The blue line shows the projected size of the
present-day observable universe soon after the
Big Bang if inflation had not taken place. (Adapted

Polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background
The white lines on this map of the cosmic background
radiation (compare Figure 26-14) indicate the directions in
which radiation from different parts of the sky is polarized.
This polarization was caused when photons in the
background radiation scattered from electrons in the early
universe. The distribution and density of these electrons
depends on the earlier expansion history of the universe.
Hence, polarization measurements can reveal whether
inflation took place as well as the nature of the inflation.

distances. Over the past 13.7 billion years, our cosmic light horizon has expanded so that we can see radiation from these distant
regions. Hence, when we examine microwaves from opposite
parts of the sky, we are seeing radiation from parts of the universe that were originally in intimate contact with one another.
This common origin is why all parts of the sky have almost exactly the same temperature.

ANALOGY An inflationary epoch can also account for the flatness of the universe. To see why, think about a small portion of
the Earth’s surface, such as your backyard. For all practical purposes, it is impossible to detect the Earth’s curvature over such
a small area, and your backyard looks flat. Similarly, the observable universe is such a tiny fraction of the entire inflated universe that any overall curvature in it is virtually undetectable
(Figure 27-3). Like your backyard, the segment of space we can
observe looks flat.

CAUTION! It is important to note that the concept of inflation
does not violate Einstein’s dictum that nothing can travel faster
than the speed of light. Remember that the expansion of the universe is the expansion of space itself, not the motion of objects
through space. During the inflationary epoch, the distances between particles increased enormously, but this was entirely the
result of a sudden vigorous expansion of space. Particles did not
move through space; space itself inflated.
As we will see later in this chapter, the inflationary model
helps us to understand a number of other aspects of the universe.
This is an important reason why many astronomers have confidence that inflation really did take place. However, other cosmological models have been proposed to explain the isotropy and
flatness problems. It turns out that a stringent test on such models, as well as on different types of inflationary models, is what
they predict about the polarization of the cosmic background radiation. (We discussed this polarization in Section 26-8.) Figure
27-4 shows measurements of the background radiation’s polarization from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe. While
such measurements are very difficult and still in their infancy, the
data obtained to date are entirely consistent with the inflationary
model.

27-2 Inflation was one of several
profound changes that occurred
in the very early universe
If the universe went through an episode of extreme inflation,
what could have triggered it? Our understanding is that inflation
was one of a sequence of remarkable events during the first 10⫺12
second after the Big Bang. In each of these events there was a fundamental transformation of the basic physical properties of the
universe. To understand what happened during that brief moment
of time, when the universe was a hot, dense sea of fast-moving
particles and energetic photons colliding with each other, we must
first understand how particles interact at very high energies.

The Fundamental Forces of Nature
Just four fundamental forces—gravitation, electromagnetism, and
the strong and weak forces—explain the interactions of everything in the universe. Of these forces, gravitation is the most familiar (Figure 27-5a). It is a long-range force that dominates the
universe over astronomical distances. The electromagnetic force is
also a long-range force, but it is intrinsically much stronger than
the gravitational force. For example, the electromagnetic force between an electron and a proton is about 1039 times stronger than
the gravitational force between those two particles. That is why
the electromagnetic force, not the gravitational force, is responsible for holding electrons in orbit about the nuclei in atoms.
We do not generally observe longer-range effects of the electromagnetic force, because there is usually a negative electric
charge for every positive charge and a south magnetic pole for
every north magnetic pole. Thus, over great volumes of space the
effects of electromagnetism effectively cancel out. No similar canceling occurs with gravity because there is no equivalent “negative mass.” This explains why the force that holds the Earth in
orbit around the Sun is gravitational, not electromagnetic.
The strong force holds protons and neutrons together inside
the nuclei of atoms (Figure 27-5b). It is said to be a short-range
force: Its influence extends only over distances less than about
10⫺15 m, about the diameter of a proton. Without the strong
force, nuclei would disintegrate because of the electromagnetic

Numerous experiments in nuclear physics demonstrate that
protons and neutrons are composed of more basic particles called
quarks, the most common varieties being “up” (u) quarks and
“down” (d) quarks. A proton is composed of two up quarks and
one down quark, a neutron of two down quarks and one up
quark.
In the 1970s the concept of quarks led to a breakthrough in
our understanding of the strong and weak forces. The strong

force holds quarks together, while the weak force is at work
whenever a quark changes from one variety to another. For example, when a neutron decays into a proton, one of the neutron’s
down quarks changes into an up quark as shown in Figure 27-5c.
Thus, the weak force is responsible for transformations such as

to their theory, now called quantum electrodynamics, charged
particles interact by exchanging photons that cannot be observed
directly, because they exist for extremely short time intervals. (We
will explore such virtual photons in Section 27-3.)
Quantum electrodynamics has proved the most successful
theory in modern physics. It describes with remarkable accuracy
many details of the electromagnetic interaction between charged
particles. Inspired by these successes, physicists have tried to develop similar theories for the other three forces. In these theories,
the weak force occurs when particles exchange intermediate vector bosons, the gravitational force occurs when particles exchange
gravitons, and quarks stick together by exchanging gluons. The
table in Figure 27-5 summarizes these features of the four fundamental forces.

Unified Theories of the Fundamental Forces

7.4

Physicists made important progress in understanding
the weak force during the 1970s. Steven Weinberg,
Sheldon Glashow, and Abdus Salam proposed a theory
with three types of intermediate vector bosons, which are exchanged in various manifestations of the weak force. These three
particles were actually discovered in experiments in the 1980s,
providing strong support for the theory.
A startling prediction of the Weinberg-Glashow-Salam theory
is that the weak force and the electromagnetic force should be
identical to each other for particles with energies greater than
100 GeV. (One GeV equals 109, or 1 billion, electron volts; see
Section 5-5.) In other words, if particles are slammed together
with a total energy greater than 100 GeV, then electromagnetic
interactions become indistinguishable from weak interactions. We
say that above 100 GeV the electromagnetic force and the weak
force are “unified” into a single electroweak force.
This unification occurs because the three types of intermediate vector bosons behave just like photons above 100 GeV. At
such high energies, these three particles actually lose their mass,
and the weak force becomes a long-range force with the same intrinsic strength as electromagnetism. Physicists describe this similarity by saying that “symmetry is restored” above 100 GeV.
In the world around us, however, the typical energies with
which particles interact are very much lower, on the order of
1 eV or less. Below 100 GeV, intermediate vector bosons behave
like massive particles, but photons are always massless. Because
intermediate vector bosons and photons are not similar at low energies, we say that “symmetry is broken” below 100 GeV, which
is why the electromagnetic and the weak forces behave so differently in the world around us. In the language of physics, a spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs.
In the 1970s, Sheldon Glashow, Howard Georgi, Jogesh Pati,
and Abdus Salam proposed grand unified theories (or GUTs),
which predict that the strong force becomes unified with the weak
and electromagnetic forces at energies above 1014 GeV. In other
words, if particles were to collide at energies greater than 1014 GeV,
the strong, weak, and electromagnetic interactions would all be
long-range forces and would be indistinguishable from each other.
Many physicists suspect that all four forces may be unified at
energies greater than 1019 GeV (Figure 27-6a). That is, if particles were to collide at these colossal energies, there would be no

difference between the gravitational, electromagnetic, and nuclear
forces. However, no one has yet succeeded in working out the details of such a supergrand unified theory, which is sometimes
called a theory of everything (or TOE).
Physicists use particle accelerators to examine the unification
of the weak and electromagnetic forces by slamming particles together at energies around 100 GeV (Figure 27-6b). There is probably no hope, however, of ever constructing machines capable of
making particles collide with energies approaching 1019 GeV. It
may thus be impossible to test directly the grand and supergrand
unified theories in a laboratory. However, the universe immediately after the Big Bang was so hot and its particles were moving
so fast that they did indeed collide with energies on the order of
1019 GeV. The evolution of the universe during its earliest moments has thus become a laboratory for testing some of the most
elegant, sophisticated theories in physics.

The Fundamental Forces in the Early Universe
Figure 27-6a shows how the various forces changed during the
first fraction of a second after the Big Bang. Before the Planck
time (from t ⫽ 0 s to t ⫽ 10–43 s), particles collided with energies
greater than 1019 GeV, and all four forces were unified. Because
we do not yet have a TOE that properly describes the behavior
of gravity, we remain ignorant of what was going on during the
first 10⫺43 second of the universe’s existence. We know, however,
that by the end of the Planck time, the expansion and cooling
of the universe had caused the energy of particles to fall to
1019 GeV. At energies below this, gravity is thought not to be unified with the other three forces.
In the language of physics, at t ⫽ 10⫺43 s there was a spontaneous symmetry breaking in which gravity was “frozen out” of
the otherwise unified hot soup that filled all space. In such a
“soup,” the typical energy of a particle (E) is related to temperature (T) by E ⫽ kT, where k is the Boltzmann constant (roughly
10⫺4 eV/K, or 10⫺13 GeV/K). Thus, the temperature of the universe was 1032 K when gravity emerged as a separate force.
As the universe expanded, its temperature decreased and the
energy of particles decreased as well. (We discussed this property
of gases in Box 21-1.) At t ⫽ 10⫺35 s, the energy of particles in
the universe had fallen to 1014 GeV, equivalent to a temperature
of 1027 K. At energies and temperatures below these, the strong
force is no longer unified with the electromagnetic and weak
forces. Thus, at t ⫽ 10⫺35 s, there was a second spontaneous symmetry breaking, at which time the strong force “froze out.”
The inflationary epoch is thought to have begun at this point.
Physicists hypothesize that before the strong force decoupled from
the electroweak force, the universe was in an unstable state called
a false vacuum. In this state, physicists hypothesize that the energy associated with a quantity called the inflaton field had a
nonzero value (Figure 27-7a). (Just as the space around a magnet
is permeated by a magnetic field, like that shown in Figure 7-13a,
the entire universe is thought to be permeated by the inflaton
field.) This state was unstable in the same sense as a ball perched
atop a cone with a pointed top: The ball will stay there if left
undisturbed, but will roll downhill if even slightly disturbed. In
an analogous way, it is thought that at the time that the strong
and electroweak forces decoupled, the universe “rolled downhill”

and energy in the universe burst
forth from the vacuum of space
Inflation was a brief but stupendous expansion of the universe
soon after the beginning of time. Physicists now realize that inflation helps explain where all the matter and radiation in the universe came from. To see how a violent expansion of space could
create particles, we must first understand what quantum mechanics tells us about space.

Quantum Mechanics and the
Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle
BL

INK 2

WE

BL

INK 2

These ideas are at the heart of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, first formulated in 1927 by the German physicist Werner Heisenberg, one of the founders
of quantum mechanics. This principle states that there is a reciprocal uncertainty between position and momentum (equal to the
mass of a particle times its velocity). The more precisely you try
to measure the position of a particle, the more unsure you become
of how the particle is moving. Conversely, the more accurately
you determine the momentum of a particle, the less sure you are
of its location. These restrictions are not a result of errors in making measurements; they are fundamental limitations imposed by
the nature of the universe.
There is an analogous uncertainty involving energy and time.
You cannot know the energy of a system with infinite precision
at every moment in time. Over short time intervals, there can be
great uncertainty about the amounts of energy in the subatomic
world. Specifically, let ⌬E be the smallest possible uncertainty in
energy measured over a short interval of time ⌬t. (Astronomers
and physicists often use the capital Greek letter delta, ⌬, as a prefix to denote a small quantity or a small change in a quantity.)

Quantum mechanics is the branch of physics that explains the behavior of nature on the atomic scale and
smaller. For example, quantum mechanics tells us how
to calculate the structure of atoms and the interactions between
atomic nuclei. Elementary particle physics is the branch of quantum mechanics that deals with individual subatomic particles and
their interactions, including the strong, weak, and electromagnetic forces that we discussed in Section 27-2.
The submicroscopic world of quantum mechanics is significantly different from the ordinary world around us. In the ordinary world we have no trouble knowing where things are. You
know where your house is; you know where your car is; you
know where this book is. In the subatomic world of electrons and
nuclei, however, you can no longer speak with this same confidence. A certain amount of fuzziness, or uncertainty, enters into
the description of reality at the incredibly small dimensions of the
quantum world.
To appreciate the reasons for this uncertainty, imagine trying
to measure the position of a single electron. To find out where it

is located, you must observe it. And to observe it, you must shine
a light on it. However, the electron is so tiny and has such a small
mass that the photons in your beam of light possess enough energy to give the electron a mighty kick. As soon as a photon
strikes the electron, the electron recoils in some unpredictable direction. Consequently, no matter how carefully you try to measure the precise location of an electron, you necessarily introduce
some uncertainty into the speed of that electron.

7.7

to the true vacuum, a state of lower energy. The universe’s transition to the true vacuum released energy that caused it to expand
tremendously in a brief interval of time (Figure 27-6b). By the time
the inflationary epoch had ended, about 10⫺32 s after the Big Bang,
the universe had increased in scale by a factor of roughly 1050.
The rapid expansion of the universe also gave rise to a rapid
cooling. At the end of the inflationary epoch, the temperature of
the universe may have dropped to about 3 K, about the same as
the temperature that the cosmic background radiation has today.
But as the universe finally settled into the vacuum-energy state,
an additional amount of energy was released that went into reheating the universe to a temperature of 1027 K—about the same
as it had before inflation began (Figure 27-7c). Thus, inflation
caused the universe to expand tremendously while having no net
effect on its temperature.
After the end of the inflationary epoch at t ⫽ 10–32 s, the universe continued to expand and cool at a more sedate rate. At
t ⫽ 10–12 s, the temperature of the universe had dropped to
1015 K, the energy of the particles had fallen to 100 GeV, and
there was a final spontaneous symmetry breaking and “freezeout” that separated the electromagnetic force from the weak
force. From that moment on, all four forces have interacted with
particles essentially as they do today.

This says that the shorter the time interval ⌬t, the greater the energy uncertainty ⌬E must be in order to ensure that the product
of ⌬E and ⌬t is equal to h/2␲.
We might look upon the Heisenberg uncertainty principle as
merely an unfortunate limitation on our ability to know everything with infinite precision. But, in fact, this principle provides
startling insights into the nature of the universe.

Spontaneously Created Matter and Antimatter
We have seen that one of the important conclusions of Einstein’s
special theory of relativity is the equivalence of mass and energy:
E ⫽ mc2 (see Section 16-1). There is nothing uncertain about the
speed of light (c), which is an absolute constant. Therefore, any
uncertainty in the energy of a physical system can be attributed
to an uncertainty ⌬ m in the mass. Thus,
⌬E ⫽ ⌬m ⫻ c2

Exploring the Early Universe

Combining this expression with the previous equation, we

This result is astonishing. It means that over a very brief interval ⌬t of time, we cannot be sure how much matter there is in
a particular location, even in “empty
space.” During this brief moment,
matter can spontaneously appear Quantum mechanics
and then disappear. The greater the reveals that “empty”
amount of matter (⌬m) that appears space is not empty, but
spontaneously, the shorter the time is seething with particles

consequence of quantum mechanics.
No particle can appear spontaneously by itself, however. For
each particle created, so is a second, almost identical antiparticle.
In other words, equal amounts of matter and antimatter come
into existence and then disappear.
Despite its exotic name, there is actually nothing terribly
mysterious about antimatter. A particle and an antiparticle are
identical in almost every respect; their main distinction is that
they carry opposite electric charges. For example, an ordinary
electron (e⫺) carries a negative charge; the corresponding antiparticle has the same mass but a positive charge, which is why it is
called a positron (e⫹). Because particles and antiparticles come
and go in pairs, the total electric charge in the universe remains
constant. Particles that have no electric charge can also have corresponding antiparticles. An example is the neutrino (␯); we met
⫺), in Section 27-2. The antineuits antiparticle, the antineutrino (␯
trino is also electrically neutral, but differs from the neutrino in
having opposite values of other, more subtle physical properties.
A spontaneously created particle-antiparticle pair lasts for
only an incredibly brief time. For example, consider an electron
and a positron, each with a mass 9.11 ⫻ 10⫺31 kg. If we rewrite
the Heisenberg uncertainty principle for mass and time to solve

In other words, an electron and a positron can spontaneously appear and then disappear without violating any laws of physics—

but they can remain in existence for no longer than 6.43 ⫻ 10⫺22 s.
The more massive the particle, the shorter the time interval it
can exist. For example, the proton has about 2000 times more
mass than the electron. Pairs of protons and their antiparticles,
called antiprotons, can appear and disappear spontaneously, but
they exist for only 1/2000 as long as pairs of electrons and
positrons do.

Virtual Pairs
Spontaneous creation can and does happen absolutely anywhere
and at any time, not just under the unusual conditions of the early
universe. (It is happening right now in the space between this
book and your eyes.) Quantum mechanics tells us that if a process
is not strictly forbidden, then it must occur. Pairs of every conceivable particle and antiparticle are constantly being created and
destroyed at every location across the universe. However, we have
no way of observing these pairs directly without violating the uncertainty principle. For this reason, they are called virtual pairs.
They do not “really” exist in the same sense as ordinary particles;
they “virtually” exist. The particles that are exchanged in the four
fundamental forces (see Section 27-2) are also virtual particles.
Although virtual pairs of particles and antiparticles cannot be
observed directly, their effects have nonetheless been detected.
Imagine, for example, an electron in orbit about the nucleus of an
atom, such as a hydrogen atom. Ideally, the electron should follow its orbit in a smooth, unhampered fashion. However, because
of the constant brief appearance and disappearance of pairs of
particles and antiparticles, minuscule electric fields exist for extremely short intervals of time. These tiny, fleeting electric fields
cause the electron to jiggle slightly in its orbit. This jiggling produces slight changes in the energies of different electron orbits in
the hydrogen atom, which manifest themselves as a minuscule
shift in the wavelengths of the hydrogen spectral lines. (We discussed the connection between the energies of electron orbits in
hydrogen and the hydrogen spectrum in Section 5-8.)
This shift was first detected in 1947 by the American physicists Willis Lamb and R. C. Retherford and today is known as the
Lamb shift. The Lamb shift provides powerful support for the
idea that every point in space, all across the universe, is seething
with virtual pairs of particles and antiparticles. In this sense,
“empty space” is actually not empty at all. Figure 27-8 sketches
the constant appearance and disappearance of virtual particles
and antiparticles.
In some circumstances, virtual pairs can become real pairs of
particles and antiparticles, a phenomenon called pair production.
It has been known for years that highly energetic gamma rays
(photons) can convert their energy into pairs of particles and antiparticles. Quite simply, the gamma ray disappears upon colliding with a second photon, and a particle and an antiparticle
appear in its place. These particles and antiparticles come from
nature’s ample supply of virtual pairs. The gamma rays provide a
virtual pair with so much energy that the virtual particles can appear as real particles in the real world.
Pair production is routinely observed in high-energy nuclear
experiments (see Figure 27-6b). Indeed, it is one of the ways in
which physicists manufacture exotic species of particles and antiparticles. The only requirement is that nature’s balance sheet be

mass M, the incoming gamma-ray photons must possess an
amount of energy E that is greater than or equal to Mc 2. If the
photons carry too little energy (less than Mc 2), pair production
will not occur. Likewise, the more energetic the photons, the
more massive the particles and antiparticles that can be manufactured. Figure 27-9a shows this process of pair production. Figure

Inflation: From Virtual to Real Particles The universe expanded by
such a tremendous factor during the inflationary epoch that the members
of virtual particle-antiparticle pairs could no longer find each other. As a
result, these virtual particles and antiparticles became real particles and
antiparticles.

Around 1980 physicists began applying these ideas to their
thinking about the creation of the universe. During the inflationary epoch, space was expanding with explosive vigor. As we have
seen, however, all space is seething with virtual pairs of particles
and antiparticles. Normally, a particle and an antiparticle have no
trouble getting back together in a time interval (⌬t) short enough
to be in compliance with the uncertainty principle. During inflation, however, the universe expanded so fast that particles were
rapidly separated from their corresponding antiparticles. Deprived
of the opportunity to recombine, these virtual particles had to become real particles in the real world. In this way, the universe was
flooded with particles and antiparticles created by the violent expansion of space (Figure 27-10).

27-4 As the early universe expanded and
cooled, most of the matter and antimatter
annihilated each other
As soon as the flood of matter and antimatter appeared in the
universe, collisions between particles and antiparticles began to
produce numerous high-energy gamma rays. As these gamma rays
collided, they promptly turned back into the particles and antiparticles from which they came. As a result, the rate of pair production soon equaled the rate of annihilation. For example, for
every electron and positron that annihilated each other to create
gamma rays (Figure 27-9b), two gamma rays collided elsewhere
to produce an electron and a positron (Figure 27-9a). In other
words, annihilation and pair production reactions proceeded with
equal vigor, and as many particles and antiparticles were being
created as were being destroyed.
As the universe continued to expand, all the gamma-ray photons became increasingly redshifted. As a result, the temperature

These particles have a very small mass, so their threshold temperature is quite low. These particles take part in the nuclear reactions that transform neutrons into protons and vice versa. For
example, a neutron can decay into a proton by emitting an electron and an antineutrino:

This radioactive decay happens quickly (its half-life is about
10.5 minutes), which is why we do not find free neutrons floating around in the universe today. In the first 2 seconds after the
Big Bang, however, neutrons were also created by collisions between protons and electrons:
p ⫹ e⫺ 씮 n ⫹ ␯
This reaction kept the number of neutrons approximately
equal to the number of protons. This balance was maintained
only as long as collisions between protons and electrons were frequent. But the number of electrons decreased precipitously as the
temperature fell below 6 ⫻ 109 K and electrons and positrons annihilated each other (Section 27-4). By the time the universe was
about 2 seconds old, no new neutrons were being formed, the
natural tendency for neutrons to decay into protons took over,
and the number of neutrons began to decline.

Spawning the First Nuclei
BL

INK 2

Before many of the neutrons could decay into protons,
they began to combine with protons to form nuclei.
Nuclei of helium, the first element more massive than
hydrogen, consist of either two protons and two neutrons (4He)
or two protons and a single neutron (3He). It is exceedingly
7.8

As the universe continued to expand, temperatures
eventually became so low that the gamma rays no
longer had enough energy to create particular kinds of
particles and antiparticles. We say that the temperature dropped
below the particular particle’s threshold temperature. Collisions
between these types of particles and antiparticles continued to
add photons to the cosmic-radiation background, but collisions
between photons could no longer replenish the supply of particles
and antiparticles.
At the same time that quark confinement became possible so
that protons and neutrons appeared, the universe also became
cooler than the 1013-K threshold temperatures of both protons and
neutrons. No new protons or neutrons were formed by pair production, but the annihilation of protons by antiprotons and of neutrons by antineutrons continued vigorously everywhere throughout
space. This wholesale annihilation dramatically lowered the matter
content (particles and antiparticles) of the universe, while simultaneously increasing the radiation (photon) content.
A little later, when the universe was about 1 second old, its
temperature fell below 6 ⫻ 109 K, the threshold temperature for
electrons and positrons. A similar annihilation of pairs of electrons and positrons further decreased the matter content of the
universe while raising its radiation content. This radiation field,
which fills all space, is the primordial fireball discussed in Section
26-5. This fireball, which dominated the universe for the next
380,000 years, therefore derived much of its energy from the annihilation of particles and antiparticles during the first second after the Big Bang.
Now we have a dilemma. If there had been perfect symmetry
between particles and antiparticles, then for every proton there
should have been an antiproton. For every electron, there should
likewise have been a positron. Consequently, by the time the universe was 1 second old, every particle would have been annihilated by an antiparticle, leaving no matter at all in the universe.
Obviously, this did not happen. The planets, stars, and galaxies we see in the sky are made of matter, not antimatter. (If there
were substantial amounts of antimatter in the universe, it would

eventually collide with ordinary matter. We would then see copious amounts of gamma rays being emitted from the entire sky.
While we do observe gamma-ray photons from various locations
in the universe, they are neither numerous enough nor of the
right energy to indicate the presence of much antimatter.) Thus,
there must have been an excess of matter over antimatter immediately after the Big Bang, so that the particles outnumbered the
antiparticles.
We can estimate the extent of this asymmetry between matter
and antimatter. As noted in Section 26-5, there are roughly 109
photons today in the microwave background for each proton and
neutron in the universe. Thus, for every 109 antiprotons, there
must have been 109 plus one ordinary protons, leaving one surviving proton after annihilation. Similarly, for every 109 positrons,
there must have been 109 plus one ordinary electrons. Theories of
elementary particles and their interactions do indeed predict a
slight preference for matter over antimatter of just this sort.

of the radiation field fell. Due to their frequent interaction, radiation and particles of all kinds were in thermal equilibrium: All
particle species, including photons, were at the same temperature.
Hence, as the radiation temperature decreased, the temperature of
particles of different types decreased as well.

Instead, helium nuclei are built in a
series of steps. The first step is to have a single proton and a single neutron combine to form deuterium (2H), sometimes called
“heavy hydrogen.” A photon (␥) is emitted in this process, so we
write this reaction as
p ⫹ n 씮 2H ⫹ ␥
Forming deuterium does not immediately lead to the formation of helium, however. The problem is that deuterium nuclei are
easily destroyed, because a proton and a neutron do not stick together very well. Indeed, in the early universe, high-energy gamma
rays easily broke deuterium nuclei back down into independent
protons and neutrons. As a result, the synthesis of helium could
not get beyond the first step. This block to the creation of helium
is called the deuterium bottleneck.
When the universe was about 3 minutes old, the background
radiation had cooled enough that its photons no longer had
enough energy to break up the deuterium. By this time, most of
the neutrons had decayed into protons, and protons outnumbered
neutrons by about 6 to 1. Because deuterium nuclei could now
survive, the remaining neutrons combined with protons and rapidly produced helium. (The Cosmic Connections figure for Chapter 16 depicts a similar sequence of reactions that take place in
the core of the present-day Sun.)
The result was what we find in the universe today—about one
helium atom for every ten hydrogen atoms. In addition to helium,
nuclei of lithium (Li, which has three protons) and beryllium (Be,
which has four) were also produced in small numbers. The process
of building up nuclei such as deuterium and helium from protons
and neutrons is called nucleosynthesis (Figure 27-11).
Because nuclei have positive electric charges, bringing them
together to form more massive nuclei requires that they overcome
their mutual electric repulsion. They are unable to do so if they
are moving too slowly, which will be the case if the temperature
is too low. As a result, by about 15 minutes after the Big Bang
the universe was no longer hot enough for nucleosynthesis to take
place. Only the four lightest elements (hydrogen, helium, lithium,
and beryllium) were present in appreciable numbers. The heavier
elements would be formed only much later, once stars had formed
and nuclear reactions within those stars could manufacture carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and all the other elements.

CAUTION! Keep in mind that only nuclei formed in the first
15 minutes of the history of the universe. It would be another
380,000 years before temperatures became low enough for these
nuclei to combine with electrons to form atoms.

The Neutrino-Antineutrino Background
While nuclei were being formed in the early universe, what happened to all those primordial neutrinos and antineutrinos that
had interacted so vigorously with the protons and neutrons before
the universe was 2 seconds old? The answer is that by t ⫽ 2 s,
matter was sufficiently spread out so that the universe became

the temperature had dropped below 4 ⫻ 108 K, no further nucleosynthesis

transparent to neutrinos and antineutrinos. From that time on,
neutrinos and antineutrinos could travel across the universe unimpeded. (Recall from Section 16-4 that the Earth itself is virtually
transparent to neutrinos from the Sun.)
The neutrinos and antineutrinos that were liberated at t ⫽ 2 s
should now fill the universe much as the cosmic microwave background does. Indeed, these ancient neutrinos and antineutrinos
may be about as populous today as the photons in the microwave
background (of which there are 4.1 ⫻ 108 per cubic meter). The
neutrino-antineutrino background should be slightly cooler
than the photon background, which received extra energy from
electron-positron annihilations. Physicists estimate that the current temperature of the neutrino-antineutrino background is about
2 K, as opposed to 2.725 K for the microwave background. Unfortunately, because neutrinos and antineutrinos are so difficult
to detect, we do not yet have direct evidence of the neutrinoantineutrino background.

27-6 Galaxies and the first stars formed from
density fluctuations in the early universe
The distribution of matter in the universe today is quite lumpy.
Stars are grouped together in galaxies, galaxies into clusters, and

Exploring the Early Universe

clusters into superclusters that stretch across 50 Mpc (150 million
ly) or more (see Section 24-6). Furthermore, galaxies seem to be
concentrated along enormous sheets, which in turn surround
voids measuring 30 to 120 Mpc (100 million to 400 million ly)
across. Figures 24-23 and 24-24 show these features, which characterize the large-scale structure of the universe. How did this
large-scale structure arise from the chaos of the primordial fireball? When did stars first appear in the universe? And when and
how did galaxies first form?

Density Fluctuations and the Jeans Length
At first glance the origin of large-scale structure seems puzzling,
because the early universe must have been exceedingly smooth.
To see why, think back to the era of recombination that occurred
380,000 years after the Big Bang (see Section 26-5). Before recombination, high-energy photons were constantly and vigorously colliding with charged particles throughout all space. After
recombination, the universe became transparent, and these photons stopped interacting with the matter in the universe. Astronomers say that matter “decoupled” from radiation during the
era of recombination. Because the cosmic microwave background
is extremely isotropic, we can conclude that the matter with which
these photons once collided so frequently must also have been
spread smoothly across space.
The distribution of matter during the early universe could not
have been perfectly uniform, however. If it had been, it would still
have to be absolutely uniform today; there would now be only a
few atoms per cubic meter of space, with no stars and no galaxies. Consequently, there must have been slight lumpiness, or density fluctuations, in the distribution of matter in the early universe.
These are thought to have originated in the very early universe,
even before the inflationary epoch. Infinitesimally small quantum
fluctuations in density, which are allowed by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle (see Section 27-3), were stretched during inflation to appreciable size. Through the action of gravity, these
fluctuations eventually grew to become the galaxies and clusters

733

of galaxies that we see today throughout the universe. As we saw
in Section 26-5 and Section 26-8, the pattern of density fluctuations became imprinted on the cosmic background radiation during the era of recombination. Figure 26-14 and Figure 27-7 show
a map of these fluctuations obtained from the WMAP microwave
background spacecraft.
Our understanding of how gravity can amplify density fluctuations dates back to 1902, when the British physicist James
Jeans solved a problem first proposed by Isaac Newton. Suppose
that you have a gas with only very tiny fluctuations in density, as
shown in Figure 27-12a. These regions of higher density will then
gravitationally attract nearby material and thus gain mass. As this
happens, however, the pressure of the gas inside these regions will
also increase, which can make these regions expand and disperse.
The problem that Jeans attacked was this: Under what conditions
does gravity overwhelm gas pressure so that a permanent object
can form?
Jeans proved that an object will grow from a density fluctuation provided that the fluctuation extends over a distance that
exceeds the so-called Jeans length (LJ):

A Globular Cluster A typical globular cluster contains 105 to 106 stars,
each with an average mass of about 1 M䉺, so the total mass of a typical
cluster is 105⫺106 M䉺. Cluster diameters range from about 6 to 120 pc
(20 to 400 ly). Because these masses and diameters are comparable to
the Jeans length (LJ) during the era of recombination, astronomers
suspect that globular clusters were among the first objects to form in the
universe. (Hubble Heritage Team/AURA/STScI/NASA)

Density fluctuations that extend across a distance larger than
the Jeans length tend to grow, while fluctuations smaller than LJ
tend to disappear (Figure 27-12b).
We can apply the Jeans formula to the conditions that prevailed during the era of recombination, when T ⫽ 3000 K and
␳m ⫽ 10⫺18 kg/m3. Taking m to be the mass of the hydrogen
atom (m ⫽ 1.67 ⫻ 10⫺27 kg), we find that LJ ⫽ 100 light-years,
the diameter of a typical globular cluster (Figure 27-13). Furthermore, the mass contained in a cube whose sides are 1 Jeans length
in size (equal to the product of the density, ␳m, and the volume
of the cube, LJ3) is about 5 ⫻ 105 M䉺, equal to the mass of a typical globular cluster. This suggests that globular clusters were
among the first objects to form after recombination.

Population III Stars: The “Zeroth” Generation
We saw in Section 19-4 that globular clusters contain the most
ancient stars we can find in the present-day universe. These are
Population II stars with a low percentage of metals (elements
heaver than hydrogen and helium), and are of an earlier stellar
generation than metal-rich Population I stars like the Sun (see
Section 19-5). However, the Population II stars in globular clus-

Like stars in the present-day universe, Population III
stars would have formed from clouds of gas. These ancient gas clouds were composed almost exclusively of
hydrogen and helium atoms, and such clouds have higher internal pressures than do metal-rich clouds of the same temperature.
A star can only form when the mutual gravitation of the various
parts of a cloud (which tends to make the cloud collapse) overcomes the internal pressure of the cloud (which tends to prevent
collapse). Hence, Population III stars could only form if their
mass (and hence their mutual gravitation) was rather large. Calculations suggest that these stars had masses from 30 to 1000 M䉺,
compared to the range of 0.4 to roughly 120 M䉺 for modern
stars. Even the smallest Population III star would rank among the
largest stars observed today.
Although no Population III stars have yet been observed directly, we have at least indirect evidence that they existed. Infrared images from the Spitzer Space Telescope like the one that
opens this chapter reveal a distant infrared background of starlight
that is what we would expect to see from these zeroth-generation
stars.
Another bit of evidence follows from the tremendous energy
output of these stars: A 1000-M䉺 Population III star would have
been millions of times more luminous than the Sun and have a
surface temperature in excess of 105 K, causing it to emit a flood
of short-wavelength, high-energy photons. The photons from even
a small number of such stars would have ionized most of the
atoms in the universe, leaving electrons and nuclei of hydrogen
and helium. This process is called reionization, a name that reminds us the universe had previously been ionized prior to recombination at t = 380,000 years. We saw in Section 26-8 that the
photons of the cosmic microwave background are scattered by
free electrons, and the effects of this scattering can be detected in
maps of the background radiation. Data from the WMAP spacecraft suggest that reionization took place around 400 million
years after the Big Bang, which in turn suggests that Population
III stars formed around that time.
Since Population III stars were all very massive, their lifetimes
were short and none could have survived to the present day. But
during their short lifetimes, thermonuclear reactions within these
stars produced elements heavier than beryllium for the first time
in the history of the universe. What is more, calculations suggest
that when these stars exploded—and due to their great mass, all
of them did—they did not leave a white dwarf, neutron star, or
black hole behind. Instead, all of their mass was ejected into space
to be incorporated into the next generation of stars. The presence

Forming Large-Scale Structure
Once clumps the size of globular clusters had formed in the universe, how did they form into galaxies, clusters of galaxies, and
larger structures? One issue that complicates this matter is the
presence of dark energy, which acts to accelerate the expansion
of the universe (see Section 26-6). This accelerated expansion
pulls clumps of material away from each other and makes it more
difficult for them to coalesce into larger structures. Another com-

Flight Center)

plication is that about 85% of the mass in the universe is in the
form of dark matter, whose nature is not known (see Section
24-8). Researchers have hypothesized different types of dark matter in the hope of explaining the large-scale structure that we see.
Neutrinos are an example of hot dark matter, so named because
it consists of lightweight particles traveling at high speeds. Cold
dark matter, on the other hand, consists of massive particles traveling at slow speeds. Examples include WIMPs (which we discussed in Section 23-4) as well as other exotic, speculative
particles.

INK 2

Scientists use supercomputer simulations to see how
different types of dark matter would influence the development of large-scale structure. Figure 27-15 shows
the results of such a simulation for a flat universe with dark energy and cold dark matter. The simulation follows the motions of
2 million particles of cold dark matter in a box that expands as
the universe expands. The box at the lower right of the figure,
representing the present time (redshift z ⫽ 0) is 43 Mpc (160 million ly) a side. At earlier times, the box represents a volume whose
side is smaller by a factor 1/(1 ⫹ z). For example, each side of the

of heavy elements in the ejected material meant that when this
material subsequently formed into clouds, the internal pressure of
these clouds was lowered substantially and it became possible for
low-mass stars to form. This laid the foundation for today’s universe, in which dim, low-mass stars are common and luminous,
massive stars are the exception (see Figure 17-5).
The era from recombination at t ⫽ 380,000 years to the first
stars at t ⫽ 400 million years is called the dark ages. The only
photons present at that time were those that make up today’s cosmic background radiation. The dark ages ended when the universe was filled for the first time with the light from stars (Figure

Figure 27-15
A Cold Dark Matter Simulation with Dark
Energy These six views show the evolution of

dark matter particles in a large, box-shaped volume of space. The box
actually expands with time to follow the expansion of the universe; in this
figure, the boxes have been rescaled so they all appear at the same size.
Small fluctuations in density are put into the simulation at the beginning

The simulation begins 120 million years after the Big Bang
with an almost perfectly uniform distribution of particles, mimicking the tiny density fluctuations that must have been present
just after inflation. A supercomputer then calculates how these
particles move, based on Newton’s laws in an expanding universe. As time goes on, the fluctuations grow into small, bright
clumps whose sizes and masses are similar to those of galaxies. A
large filament also forms, spanning the entire box from left to
right. The simulation shows that no additional structures formed
after the universe was about 6 billion years old, corresponding to
redshift z ⫽ 1. The explanation is that after this time, the accelerating expansion of the universe becomes more important than
gravitational attraction. The final frame of the simulation strongly
resembles actual maps of galaxies in our present-day universe (see
Figure 24-24).
Simulations similar to those in Figure 27-15 have also been
carried out using hot dark matter in the form of neutrinos. A
massless neutrino would always travel at the speed of light, just
as a photon does. However, experiments show that neutrinos do

(at upper left); these evolve over time to form structures that resemble
those actually observed in our present-day universe (z ⫽ 0.00, shown at
the lower right). (Simulations performed at the National Center for
Supercomputer Applications by Andrey Kravtsov/University of Chicago and
Anatoly Klypin/NMSU)

have a small mass. (This nonzero mass is what allows one type of
neutrino to transform into another. We saw in Section 16-4 that
such transformations provided the explanation to the longstanding solar neutrino problem.) Hence, neutrinos travel slower
than light, and slow down as the universe expands and cools.
Slow-moving neutrinos would accumulate over time within density fluctuations, and the gravitational pull of these neutrinos on
surrounding matter could eventually lead to the formation of
clusters of galaxies.
A primary difference between simulations based on cold and
hot dark matter is the way in which galaxies form. In calculations
based on cold dark matter, the formation of galaxies takes place
from the “bottom up.” In these simulations, the densest gas undergoes collapse early in the history of the universe and stars begin to form. The regions of star formation stream along the
filaments (Figure 27-16). When they meet at the intersections between filaments, they merge and group together into galaxies,
then clusters of galaxies, then superclusters. But in calculations
based on hot dark matter, galaxies form from the “top down.”

Exploring the Early Universe

737

Huge supercluster-sized sheets of matter form first and then fragment into galaxies. Observations of remote galaxies show that
galaxies actually formed from the “bottom up” scenario. One
piece of evidence for this is the image in Figure 27-17a, which
shows a handful of “galaxy building blocks” at z ⫽ 3.04 (when
the universe was 2.2 billion years old). These “building blocks,”
which have not yet coalesced into galaxies, lie within a long filament (see Figure 27-17b) that resembles those shown in the simulation of Figure 27-16. Figure 27-18 shows a collection of
“building blocks” at a later stage in the process of merging into
a galaxy. These observations strongly suggest that the dominant
form of dark matter is cold, not hot.

What Large-Scale Structure Reveals
How might the universe have evolved if it had contained different amounts of cold dark matter and dark energy? Figure 27-19
shows some simulations designed to explore these possibilities. If
the density of matter in the universe is kept constant, simulations
predict approximately the same structure for different values of
the dark energy density parameter ⍀⌳ defined in Section 26-6 (see
Figure 27-19a and Figure 27-19b). But if too large a matter density is used in the simulation, the voids between galaxies are
smaller than what we actually observe in our universe (Figure
27-19c). Hence, observations of galaxy clustering coupled with
supercomputer simulations of galaxy formation help determine
the matter density of our universe. (We made use of this idea in
Section 26-7. The brown band in Figure 26-19 shows the constraints on cosmological parameters from these observations and
simulations of galaxies.)

The best match to the observed distribution of galaxy clusters and to the cosmic background radiation data (see Figure

by dark energy, matter coalesced

large voids.

Section 26-7, the future of our universe is less certain, and depends on the detailed character of dark energy. More detailed
data about galaxy clusters and the cosmic background radiation
will be needed to pin down the future evolution of our universe.

Similar structures would appear
in an open, matter-dominated

density as our own.

27-7 Theories that attempt to unify the
fundamental forces predict that the
universe may have 11 dimensions
While we have a growing understanding of the early universe,
there remains a veil obscuring the first 10⫺43 s after the Big Bang.
These very first moments in the history of the universe, whose duration was the Planck time, determined everything that would
come after. To understand this brief interval, we need to construct a quantum-mechanical theory that unifies gravity with the
other fundamental forces of nature and that reconciles quantum
mechanics with gravity. While this remains an unfinished task, remarkable progress has been made in recent years. One major
breakthrough is that physicists have had to abandon the idea that
there are only three dimensions of space.

Beyond Four Dimensions: Kaluza-Klein Theories

Figure 27-20
Hidden Dimensions of Space Hidden dimensions of space might
exist provided they are curled up so tightly that we cannot observe
them. This drawing shows how an ordinary two-dimensional plane
might contain two additional dimensions. At every point on the
plane, there is a very tiny sphere so small that it cannot be seen. To
pinpoint a particular location, you need to give not only a position
on the plane but also a position on the sphere that is tangent to
the plane at that point, as indicated by the red lines. (Adapted from
D. Freedman and P. Van Nieuwenhuizen)

M-Theory and Speculative Models of the Universe
LINK 27

Theoretical physicists have shown that if there are indeed 11 dimensions, there must exist particles so massive that they have not yet been discovered. These
speculative particles may be the dark matter that pervades the
.10

In his special and general theories of relativity, Einstein combined
time with the three dimensions of ordinary space, resulting in a
four-dimensional combination called spacetime (see Section
22-1). In 1919, the Polish physicist Theodor Kaluza proposed the
existence of a fifth dimension. Kaluza hoped to describe both
gravity and electromagnetism in terms of the curvature of fivedimensional spacetime, just as Einstein had explained gravity by
itself in terms of the curvature of four-dimensional spacetime (see
Section 22-2).
A particle always follows the straightest possible path in the
four space dimensions of Kaluza’s theory. But in the three dimensions of ordinary space, the path appears curved. Hence, it appears to us that the particle has been deflected by gravitational
and electromagnetic forces. Kaluza’s hypothetical fifth dimension
exists at every point in ordinary space but is curled up so tightly,
like a very tiny loop, that it is not directly observable.

In 1926, the Swedish physicist Oskar Klein attempted to
make Kaluza’s five-dimensional theory compatible with quantum
mechanics. While he was not successful, Klein discovered that
particles of different masses could be identified with different vibrations of the tiny loop of Kaluza’s fifth dimension. Today, any
quantum-mechanical theory that uses more than four dimensions
to provide a unified description of the forces of nature is called a
Kaluza-Klein theory.
When Kaluza and Klein developed their theories, gravity and
electromagnetism were the only known forces of nature. Today
we know of four fundamental forces, which suggests that modern Kaluza-Klein theories should
have even more than five dimen- Subatomic particles may

actually be
University has argued that a geometric theory for describing all four multidimensional
forces would work best with 11 di- membranes
mensions, ten of space and one of
time. At every point in ordinary space and at every moment of
time, the seven “extra” dimensions must be rolled up, like the
loops of Kaluza and Klein, into compact structures far too tiny for
us to detect (Figure 27-20).
While we do not yet have a definite 11-dimensional theory,
physicists know something of how it would work. Particles would
travel along the straightest possible paths in spacetime, but their
paths in ordinary three-dimensional space would appear curved.
From our perspective, we interpret these curved paths as the result of the four forces acting on the particles.

universe and holds together clusters of galaxies. Even more bizarre,
the new theories no longer regard fundamental particles, such as
electrons and quarks, as tiny points of mass. Instead, these particles may actually be multidimensional membranes, wrapped so
tightly around the extra dimensions of space that they appear to
us as points.
Andrew Strominger at Harvard University has shown that
some of these membranes may fold on themselves in such a way
that not even light can escape from them. In other words, these
membranes may be black holes! This theory of membranes in 11
dimensions, or M-theory, may well explain the most exotic aspects of quantum mechanics, cosmology, and gravity. (M-theory
encompasses a number of related theories known as superstring
theories.)
One of the many speculative ideas inspired by M-theory is
the cyclic model (known in an earlier version as the ekpyrotic
model, from the Greek word for “conflagration”). In this model,
our universe is one of two four-dimensional membranes (three
space dimensions and one time dimension) that move with respect to each other along a fifth, “hidden” dimension. When the
two membranes collide, a Big Bang results. The physics of the
collision is such that each membrane automatically has the critical density, so that our universe is automatically flat. This provides a solution to the flatness problem that does not require
inflation, so there is no inflationary epoch in the cyclic model.
The cyclic model offers a natural explanation for dark matter: It
is matter in the other membrane, the particles of which we cannot see but can detect through their gravitation. Dark energy in
the cyclic model is a manifestation of the field that controls the
interaction between the two membranes. The model is called
cyclic because the membranes move apart and then back together
in a rhythmic way. We would see a universe that expands for a
time after the Big Bang, then eventually collapses back on itself
in a Big Crunch. This is followed by another Big Bang, and the
cycle repeats.
The cyclic model and the inflationary model are both scientific theories, because they both make predictions about things
that can be observed. In particular, the two models make different predictions about the redshifts of very distant galaxies and
about the polarization of the cosmic background radiation. Improved measurements of both of these will help us understand
which of these models—each exotic in its own right—is a better
description of our universe.
At present, M-theory is only the outline of a “theory of everything.” We do not yet know how to describe a quark or an electron in terms of the higher dimensions of spacetime, nor can we
yet explain the interactions among such particles. A full description of the first 10⫺43 s after the Big Bang is still far off. However, theoretical physicists around the world are devoting their
efforts to these challenging problems. In league with astronomers
and experimental physicists, they continue the age-old quest to
understand the fundamental character of the universe.
We shall not cease from exploration
And the end of all our exploring
Will be to arrive where we started
And know the place for the first time.

Key Ideas
Cosmic Inflation: A brief period of rapid expansion, called inflation, is thought to have occurred immediately after the Big Bang.
During a tiny fraction of a second, the universe expanded to a size
many times larger than it would have reached through its normal
expansion rate.
• Inflation explains why the universe is nearly flat and the 2.725-K
microwave background is almost perfectly isotropic.
The Four Forces and Their Unification: Four basic forces—
gravity, electromagnetism, the strong force, and the weak force—
explain all the interactions observed in the universe.
• Grand unified theories (GUTs) are attempts to explain three of
the forces in terms of a single consistent set of physical laws. A
supergrand unified theory would explain all four forces.
• GUTs suggest that all four fundamental forces were equivalent
just after the Big Bang. However, because we have no satisfactory
supergrand unified theory, we can as yet say nothing about the
nature of the universe during this period before the Planck time
(t ⫽ 10–43 s after the Big Bang).
• At the Planck time, gravity froze out to become a distinctive
force in a spontaneous symmetry breaking. During a second spontaneous symmetry breaking, the strong nuclear force became a
distinct force; this transition triggered the rapid inflation of the
universe. A final spontaneous symmetry breaking separated the
electromagnetic force from the weak nuclear force; from that moment on, the universe behaved as it does today.

Chapter 27

Particles and Antiparticles: Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle
states that the amount of uncertainty in the mass of a subatomic
particle increases as it is observed for shorter and shorter time
periods.
• Because of the uncertainty principle, particle-antiparticle pairs
can spontaneously form and disappear within a fraction of a second. These pairs, whose presence can be detected only indirectly,
are called virtual pairs.
• A virtual pair can become a real particle-antiparticle pair when
high-energy photons collide. In this process, called pair production, the photons disappear, and their energy is replaced by the
mass of the particle-antiparticle pair. In the process of annihilation, a colliding particle-antiparticle pair disappears and highenergy photons appear.
The Origin of Matter: Just after the inflationary epoch, the universe
was filled with particles and antiparticles formed by pair production and with numerous high-energy photons formed by annihilation. A state of thermal equilibrium existed in this hot plasma.
• As the universe expanded, its temperature decreased. When the
temperature fell below the threshold temperature required to produce each kind of particle, annihilation of that kind of particle
began to dominate over production.
• Matter is much more prevalent than antimatter in the presentday universe. This is because particles and antiparticles were not
created in exactly equal numbers just after the Planck time.
Nucleosynthesis: Helium could not have been produced until the
cosmological redshift eliminated most of the high-energy photons.
These photons created a deuterium bottleneck by breaking down
deuterons before they could combine to form helium.
Density Fluctuations and the Origin of Stars and Galaxies: The
large-scale structure of the universe arose from primordial density
fluctuations.
• The first stars were much more massive and luminous than stars
in the present-day universe. The material that they ejected into
space seeded the cosmos for all later generations of stars.
• Galaxies are generally located on the surfaces of roughly spherical voids. Models based on dark energy and cold dark matter
give good agreement with details of this large-scale structure.
The Frontier of Knowledge: The search for a theory that unifies
gravity with the other fundamental forces suggests that the universe actually has 11 dimensions (ten of space and one of time),
seven of which are folded on themselves so that we cannot see
them. The idea of higher dimensions has motivated alternative
cosmological models.

New Horizons in the Cosmic Microwave Background
by John Ruhl
he WMAP image of the cosmic microwave background
radiation (CMB) in Figure 26-14 gives us a beautiful vision of the universe when it was only a few hundred
thousand years old. This map was not—in any sense of the
phrase—made overnight. We knew for more than a decade
that measurements like these would be a wonderful tool for
cosmology. Many independent groups toiled, and many years
passed, before cutting-edge technology and hard-earned experience made these measurements possible. The result, using
data from WMAP and many other ground-based and balloonborne instruments with higher angular resolution, has helped
pin down parameters of the standard cosmological model such
as the density parameter ⍀⌳, the dark energy density parameter ⍀0, and the Hubble constant H0 to a few percent. This is
truly precision cosmology—which not long ago would have
been an oxymoron!
While the temperature of the CMB (2.725 K) has been
well measured, a new frontier awaits. We expect, and in fact
two groups of researchers have now found, that the CMB photons are slightly polarized (see Figure 27-4). The level of polarization is extremely small (a few percent of the temperature

fluctuations) and very challenging to measure, but it provides
us with a new way of probing the early universe. More precise
measurements of that polarization will be able to tell us a few
very interesting things about the early universe.
First, the prediction of polarization assumes that our current model of the very young universe is correct—specifically,
that we understand the nature of the lumps that eventually collapsed into galaxies and clusters of galaxies, and that we understand the process of the decoupling of photons and matter
that occurred when the universe was a few hundred thousand
years old. We are always looking for ways to test this model,
and the polarization provides a very strong one! Second, polarization information can be combined with the measure temperature anisotropies to improve our measurements of
cosmological parameters. We recently flew an instrument
around Antarctica to make more precise measurements of the
CMB polarizations—we are analyzing the data even now—and
other groups are ramping up their efforts as well.
There is another, very long-shot—and long-term—goal of
polarization measurements that, if successful, would lead to an
incredible discovery. The simplest models of inflation predict
that gravitational waves (see Section 22-2) were produced as
inflation ends. These waves can impress their unique “fingerprints” in the pattern of CMB polarization. If inflation occurred at a sufficiently high energy scale (near 1016 GeV), this
gravity wave “fingerprint” may be strong enough for us to detect. But if inflation happened at a much lower energy scale,
there would be too few gravitational waves for us to see the
signature.
This measurement is very challenging, and not for the
faint of heart. But if that signature can be detected, it would
give us a fantastic probe of inflation!

Suppose you were the first visitor to a new and alien
planet. How would you recognize which of the strange
objects around you were living, and which were inanimate? Questions such as these are central to astrobiology, the
study of life in the universe. Most astrobiologists suspect that if
we find living organisms on other worlds, they will be “life as we
know it”—that is, their biochemistry will be based on the unique
properties of the carbon atom, as is the case for all terrestrial life.
8.2

ne of the most compelling questions in science is also one
of the simplest: Are we alone? That is, does life exist beyond the Earth? As yet, we have no definitive answer to
this question. None of our spacecraft has found life elsewhere in
the solar system, and radio telescopes have yet to detect signals
of intelligent origin coming from space. Reports of aliens visiting
our planet and abducting humans make compelling science fiction, but none of these reports has ever been verified.
Yet there are reasons to suspect that life might indeed exist
beyond the Earth. One is that biologists find living organisms in
some of the most “unearthly” environments on our planet. An example (shown at the top of this page) is at the bottom of the Gulf
of Mexico, where the crushing pressure and low temperature
cause methane—normally a gas—to form solid, yellowish mounds.
Amazingly, these mounds teem with colonies of pink, eyeless,
alien-looking worms the size of your thumb. If life can flourish
here, might it not also flourish in the equally hostile conditions
found on other worlds?
In this chapter we will look for places in our solar system
where life may once have originated, and where it may exist today. We will see how scientists estimate the chances of finding life
beyond our solar system, and how they search for signals from
other intelligent species. And we will learn how a new generation
of telescopes may make it possible to detect the presence of even
single-celled organisms on worlds many light-years away.

Organic Molecules in the Universe
Why carbon? The reason is that carbon has the most versatile
chemistry of any element. Carbon atoms can form chemical bonds
to create especially long and complex molecules (Figure 28-1).

Organic molecules can be linked together to form elaborate
structures, such as chains, lattices, and fibers. Some of these structures are capable of complex, self-regulating chemical reactions.
Furthermore, the primary constituents of organic molecules—
carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and phosphorus—are
among the most abundant elements in the universe. The versatility and abundance of carbon suggest that extraterrestrial life is
also likely to be based on organic chemistry.
If life is based on organic molecules, then these molecules
must initially be present on a planet in order for life to arise from
nonliving matter. We now understand that many organic molecules originate from nonbiological processes in interstellar space.
One such molecule is carbon monoxide (CO), which is made
when a carbon atom and an oxygen atom collide and bond together. Carbon monoxide is found in abundance within giant interstellar clouds that lie along the spiral arms of our Milky Way
Galaxy (see Figure 1-7) as well as in other galaxies (see Figure
1-9). Carbon atoms have also combined with other elements to
produce an impressive array of interstellar organic molecules, including ethyl alcohol (CH3CH2OH), formaldehyde (H2CO),
methyl cyanoacetylene (CH3C3N), and acetaldehyde (CH3CHO).

Why Silicon is Unsuitable for Making Living Organisms Like carbon,
silicon atoms can bond with up to four other atoms. However, the
resulting compounds are either too soft or too hard, or too reactive or too
inert, to be suitable for use in living organisms. (a) Silicone has a
backbone of silicon and oxygen atoms. The molecules form a gel or liquid

rather than a solid, and are too inert to undergo the rapid chemical
changes required of molecules in organisms. (b) Molecules can also be
made with a silicon-carbon-oxygen backbone, but the results (like this
quartz crystal) are too rigid for use in organisms. (a: Richard Megna/

The planets of our solar system formed out of interstellar material (see Section 8-5), and some of the organic molecules in that
material must have ended up on the planets’ surfaces. Evidence
for this comes from meteorites called carbonaceous chondrites,
like the one shown in Figure 28-3a. These are ancient meteorites
that date from the formation of the solar system and that are often found to contain a variety of carbon-based molecules (Figure
28-3b). The spectra of comets (see Section 7-5)—which are also
among the oldest objects in the solar system—show that they,
too, contain an assortment of organic compounds.
Comets and meteoroids were much more numerous in the
early solar system than they are today, and they were correspondingly more likely to collide with a planet. These collisions would
have seeded the planets with organic compounds from the very
beginning of our solar system’s history. Similar processes are
thought to take place in other planetary systems, which are
thought to form in basically the same way as did our own (see
Figure 8-13 and the image that opens Chapter 8).

The Miller-Urey Experiment

Comets and meteorites would not have been the only
sources of organic material on the young planets of
our solar system. In 1952, the American chemists
Stanley Miller and Harold Urey demonstrated that under conditions that are thought to have prevailed on the primitive Earth,
simple chemicals can combine to form the chemical building
blocks of life. In a closed container, they prepared a sample of
“atmosphere”: a mixture of hydrogen (H2), ammonia (NH3),
methane (CH4), and water vapor (H2O), the most common molecules in the solar system. Miller and Urey then exposed this mixture of gases to an electric arc (to simulate atmospheric lightning)
for a week. At the end of this period, the inside of the container

sizing a wide variety of organic compounds. The combination of comets and meteorites falling from
space and chemical synthesis in the atmosphere could have made
the chemical building blocks of life available in substantial quantities on the young Earth.

CAUTION! It is important to emphasize that scientists have not
created life in a test tube. While organic molecules may have
been available on the ancient Earth, biologists have yet to figure
out how these molecules gathered themselves into cells and developed systems for self-replication. Nevertheless, because so
many chemical components of life are so easily synthesized under conditions that simulate the primordial Earth, it seems reasonable to suppose that life could have originated as the result
of chemical processes. Furthermore, because the molecules that
combine to form these compounds are rather common, it seems
equally reasonable that life could have originated in the same
way on other planets.
Organic building blocks are commonplace throughout the
universe, but this does not guarantee that life is equally commonplace. If a planet’s environment is hostile, life may never get
started or may quickly be extinguished. But we now have evidence

that Jupiter-sized planets orbit other stars (see Section 8-6 and
Geoff Marcy’s essay “Alien Planets” following Chapter 8) and
that additional planetary systems are forming around young stars
(see Section 8-4, especially Figure 8-8). It seems probable that
there are Earthlike planets orbiting other stars, and that conditions on some of these worlds may be suitable for life as we
know it.

for life to have evolved
If life evolved on Earth from nonliving organic molecules, might
the same process have taken place elsewhere in our solar system?

One major problem is that liquid water is essential for the survival of life as we know it. The water need not be pleasant by human standards—terrestrial organisms have been found in water
that is boiling hot, fiercely acidic, or ice cold (see the image that
opens this chapter)—but it must be liquid. In order for water on
a planet’s surface to remain liquid, the temperature cannot be too
hot or too cold. Furthermore, there must be a relatively thick atmosphere to provide enough pressure to keep liquid water from
evaporating. Of all the worlds of the present-day solar system,
only Earth has the right conditions for water to remain liquid on
its surface.
BL

INK 2

However, there is now compelling evidence that
Europa, one of the large satellites of Jupiter (see Table
7-2 and Figure 7-4), has an ocean of water beneath its
icy surface. As it orbits Jupiter, Europa is caught in a tug-of-war
between Jupiter’s gravitational influence and those of the other
large satellites. This flexes the interior of Europa, and this flexing
generates enough heat to keep subsurface water from freezing.
Chunks of ice on the surface can float around on this underground ocean, rearranging themselves into a pattern that reveals
the liquid water beneath.
No one knows whether life exists in Europa’s ocean. But interest in this exotic little world is great, and scientists have proposed several missions to explore Europa in more detail.

Searching for Life on Mars
The next best possibility for the existence of life is Mars. The
present-day Martian atmosphere is so thin that water can exist
only as ice or as a vapor. However,
images made from Martian orbit Some areas on Mars were
show dried-up streambeds, flash
covered with liquid water
flood channels, and sediment deposits. These features are evidence for extended periods
that the Martian atmosphere was
once thicker and that water once coursed over the planet’s surface. Could life have evolved on Mars during its “wet” period? If
so, could life—even in the form of microorganisms—have survived as the Martian atmosphere thinned and the surface water
either froze or evaporated?
In 1976, two spacecraft landed on different parts of Mars in
search of answers to these questions. Viking Lander 1 and Viking
Lander 2 each carried a scoop at the end of a mechanical arm to
retrieve surface samples (Figure 28-5). These samples were deposited into a compact on-board biological laboratory that carried out three different tests for Martian microorganisms.
1. The gas-exchange experiment was designed to detect any
processes that might be broadly considered as respiration. A
surface sample was placed in a sealed container along with a
controlled amount of gas and nutrients. The gases in the
container were then monitored to see if their chemical
composition changed.

ground. And yet another option is that there is life on Mars, but
the experimental apparatus on board the Viking Lander spacecraft was not sophisticated enough to detect it.

An entirely different set of biological experiments were
designed for the British spacecraft Beagle 2, which
landed on Mars in December 2003. (The spacecraft’s
name commemorated HMS Beagle, the survey ship from which
Charles Darwin made many of the observations that led to the
theory of evolution.)
Unlike the Viking Lander experiments, the apparatus on
board Beagle 2 was designed to test for the presence of either living or dead microorganisms. To do this, the spacecraft was to
bore into the interiors of rocks to gather pristine, undisturbed
samples, then heat these samples in the presence of oxygen gas.
All carbon compounds decompose and form carbon dioxide (CO2)
when treated in this way, but biologically important molecules
signal their presence by decomposing at a lower temperature. As
a further test for the chemicals of life, Beagle 2 was to check to
see how many of the CO2 molecules contain the isotope 12C
(which appears preferentially in biological molecules) and how
many contain 13C (which does not). (See Box 5-5 for a description of isotopes.) A positive result to these experiments would indicate that Martian rocks contain microorganisms that either
survive to the present day or that died out at some point in
the past.
Another Beagle 2 experiment was to search for traces of
methane in the Martian atmosphere. Microorganisms on Earth
can gain energy by converting carbon dioxide to methane, and
presumably Martian microorganisms could do the same. Left to
itself, methane rapidly decomposes in the Martian atmosphere.
Hence, if any methane is found on Mars, it must necessarily have
been freshly formed—which would strongly suggest that life exists on Mars today.
Unfortunately, scientists on Earth were unable to establish
contact with Beagle 2 after landing, and so no results were returned from these experiments. But scientists hope to send a replacement lander to Mars using a set of experiments like those on
board Beagle 2.

2. The labeled-release experiment was designed to detect
metabolic processes. A sample was moistened with nutrients
containing radioactive carbon atoms. If any organisms in the
sample consumed the nutrients, their waste products should
include gases containing the telltale radioactive carbon.
3. The pyrolytic-release experiment was designed to detect
photosynthesis, the biological process by which terrestrial plants
use solar energy to help synthesize organic compounds from
carbon dioxide. In the Viking experiments, a surface sample
was placed in a container along with radioactive carbon dioxide
and exposed to artificial sunlight. If plantlike photosynthesis
occurred, microorganisms in the sample would take in some of
the radioactive carbon from the gas.
The first data returned from these experiments caused great
excitement, for in almost every case, rapid and extensive changes
were detected inside the sealed containers. Further analysis of the
data, however, led to the conclusion that these changes were due
solely to nonbiological chemical processes. It appears that the
Martian surface is rich in unstable chemicals that react with water to release oxygen gas. Because the present-day surface of Mars
is bone-dry, these chemicals had nothing to react with until
they were placed inside the moist interior of the Viking Lander
laboratory.
At best, the results from the Viking Lander biological experiments were inconclusive. Perhaps life never existed on Mars at
all. Or perhaps it did originate there, but failed to survive the
thinning of the Martian atmosphere, the unstable chemistry of the
planet’s surface, and exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the
Sun. (Unlike Earth, Mars has no ozone layer to block ultraviolet
rays.) Another possibility is that Martian microorganisms have
survived only in certain locations that the Viking Landers did not
sample, such as isolated spots on the surface or deep beneath the

New Evidence for Martian Water
While the promise of Beagle 2 will have to be fulfilled by a future mission, scientists searching for evidence of Martian life have
been encouraged by other spacecraft that have provided new evidence of water on Mars. The European Space Agency’s Mars Express spacecraft, which went into orbit around Mars in December
2003, used its infrared cameras to examine the ice cap at the Martian south pole (Figure 28-6). These cameras allowed scientists to
see through the ice cap’s surface layer of frozen carbon dioxide
and reveal an underlying layer with the characteristic spectrum of
water ice. (Figure 7-4 shows a similar spectrum obtained from
Europa.) In January 2004, NASA successfully landed two robotic
rovers named Spirit and Opportunity at two very different sites
on opposite sides of Mars. While the terrain around the Spirit
landing site appears to have been dry for billions of years, Opportunity landed in an area that appears to have been under water for extended periods (Figure 28-7a). Measurements made by

shadows on wind-blown hills. Microscopic life may once have existed on Mars, and may yet exist today, but there is no evidence
that the red planet has ever been the home of intelligent beings.

28-3 Meteorites from Mars have been
scrutinized for life-forms
While spacecraft can carry biological experiments to other worlds
such as Mars, many astrobiologists look forward to the day when
a spacecraft will return Martian samples to laboratories on Earth.
Until that day arrives, we have the next best thing: A dozen meteorites that appear to have formed on Mars have been found at
a variety of locations on the Earth.
These meteorites are called SNC meteorites after the names
given to the first three examples found (Shergotty, Nakhla, and
Chassigny). What identifies SNC meteorites as having come from
Mars is the chemical composition of trace amounts of gas trapped
within them. This composition is very different from that of the
Earth’s atmosphere, but is a nearly perfect match to the composition of the Martian atmosphere found by the Viking Landers.

Systems/NASA)

the impact falls back onto the planet’s surface. But some extraordinarily powerful impacts produce large craters—on Mars,
roughly 100 km in diameter or larger. These tremendous impacts
eject some rocks with such speed that they escape the planet’s
gravitational attraction and fly off into space.
There are numerous large craters on Mars, so a good number of Martian rocks have probably been blasted into space over
the planet’s history. These ejected rocks then go into elliptical orbits around the Sun. A few such rocks will have orbits that put
them on a collision course with the Earth, and these are the ones
that scientists find as SNC meteorites.
Using the radioactive age-dating technique (see Section 8-3),
scientists find that most SNC meteorites are between 200 million
and 1.3 billion years old, much younger than the 4.56-billion-year
age of the solar system. But one SNC meteorite, denoted by the
serial number ALH 84001 and found in Antarctica in 1984, was
discovered in 1993 to be 4.5 billion years old (Figure 28-9a).
Thus, ALH 84001 is a truly ancient piece of Mars. Analysis of
ALH 84001 suggests that it was fractured by an impact between
3.8 and 4.0 billion years ago, was ejected from Mars by another
impact 16 million years ago, and landed in Antarctica a mere
13,000 years ago.
ALH 84001 is the only known specimen of a rock that was
on Mars during the era when liquid water existed on the planet’s
surface. Scientists have therefore investigated its chemical composition carefully, in the hope that this rock may contain clues to
the amount of water that once flowed on the Martian surface.
One such clue is the presence of rounded grains of minerals called
carbonates, which can form only in the presence of water.

Close Encounters Versus Remote Communication

A tenet of modern folklore is the belief that alien civilizations do exist, and that their spacecraft have visited Earth. Indeed, surveys show that between one-third
and one-half of all Americans believe in unidentified flying objects
(UFOs). A somewhat smaller percentage believes that aliens have
landed on Earth. But, in fact, there is no scientifically verifiable
evidence of alien visitations. As an example, many UFO proponents believe that the U.S. government is hiding evidence of an

In 1996, David McKay and Everett Gibson of the NASA
Johnson Space Center, along with several collaborators, reported
the results of a two-year study of the carbonate grains in ALH
84001. They made three remarkable findings. First, in and around
the carbonate grains were large numbers of elongated, tubelike
structures resembling fossilized microorganisms (Figure 28-9b).
Second, the carbonate grains contain very pure crystals of iron
sulfide and magnetite. These two compounds are rarely found together (especially in the presence of carbonates) but can be produced by certain types of bacteria. Indeed, about one-fourth of
the magnetite crystals found in ALH 84001 are of a type that on
Earth are formed only by bacteria. Third, the carbonates contain
organic molecules—just the sort, in fact, that result from the decay of microorganisms.
McKay and Gibson concluded that the structures seen in Figure 28-9b are fossilized remains of microorganisms. If so, these
organisms lived and died on Mars billions of years ago, during
the era when liquid water was abundant.
Are McKay and Gibson’s conclusions correct? Their claims
of ancient life on Mars are extraordinary, and they require extraordinary proof. With only one rock like ALH 84001 known to
science, however, such proof is hard to come by, and many scientists are skeptical. They argue that the structures found in ALH

the existence of Martian microorganisms. Future spacecraft may help Claims that scientists

spacecraft to another star requires a flight time of tens of thousands of years. Speculative design studies have been made for unmanned probes that could reach other stars within a century or
less, but these are prohibitively expensive. Instead, many astronomers hope to learn about extraterrestrial civilizations by detecting radio transmissions from them. Radio waves are a logical
choice for interstellar communication because they can travel immense distances without being significantly degraded by the interstellar medium, the thin gas and dust found between the stars (see
Section 8-1).
Over the past several decades, astronomers have proposed
various ways to search for alien radio transmissions, and several searches have been undertaken. In 1960, Frank Drake first
used a radio telescope at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in West Virginia to listen to two Sunlike stars, Tau Ceti
and Epsilon Eridani, without success. More than 60 more extensive SETI searches have taken place since then, using radio
telescopes around the world. Occasionally, a search has detected an unusual or powerful signal. But none has ever repeated, as a signal of intelligent origin might be expected to do.
To date, we have no confirmed evidence of radio transmissions
from another world.

Should we be discouraged by this failure to make contact? What are the chances that a radio astronomer
CISE 2
might someday detect radio signals from an extraterrestrial civilization? The first person to tackle this issue was Frank
Drake, who proposed that the number of technologically advanced civilizations in the Galaxy could be estimated by a simple
equation. This is now called the Drake equation:
ER

Drake equation
N ⫽ R fp ne fl fi fc L
*
N ⫽ number of technologically advanced civilizations in the
Galaxy whose messages we might be able to detect
R ⫽ the rate at which solar-type stars form in the Galaxy
*
fp ⫽ the fraction of stars that have planets
ne ⫽ the number of planets per solar system that are
Earthlike (that is, suitable for life)
fl ⫽ the fraction of those Earthlike planets on which life
actually arises
fi ⫽ the fraction of those life-forms that evolve into
intelligent species
fc ⫽ the fraction of those species that develop adequate
technology and then choose to send messages out
into space
L ⫽ the lifetime of a technologically advanced civilization

755

The Drake equation is enlightening because it expresses the
number of extraterrestrial civilizations in a simple series of terms.
We can estimate some of these terms from what we know about
stars, stellar evolution, and planetary orbits. The Cosmic Connections figure depicts some of these considerations.
For example, the first two factors, R and fp, can be deter*
mined by observation. In estimating R , we should probably ex*
clude stars with masses greater than about 1.5 times that of the
Sun. These more massive stars use up the hydrogen in their cores
in 3 billion (3 ⫻ 109) years or less. On Earth, by contrast, human
intelligence developed only within the last million years or so,
some 4.56 billion years after the formation of the solar system. If
that is typical of the time needed to evolve higher life-forms, then
a star of 1.5 solar masses or more probably fades away or explodes into a supernova before creatures as intelligent as we can
evolve on any of that star’s planets.
Although stars less massive than the Sun have much longer
lifetimes, they, too, seem unsuited for life because they are so dim.
Only planets very near a low-mass star would be sufficiently
warm for life as we know it, and a planet that close is subject to
strong tidal forces from its star. We saw in Section 4-8 how the
Earth’s tidal forces keep the Moon locked in synchronous rotation, with one face continually facing the Earth. In the same way,
a planet that orbits too close to its star would have one hemisphere that always faced the star, while the other hemisphere
would be in perpetual, frigid darkness.
This leaves us with stars not too different from the Sun. (Like
Goldilocks sampling the three bears’ porridge, we must have a
star that is not too hot and not too cold, but just right.) Based on
statistical studies of star formation in the Milky Way, some astronomers estimate that roughly one of these Sunlike stars forms
in the Galaxy each year in the galactic habitable zone (see the
Cosmic Connections figure). This sets R at 1 per year.
*
As we saw in Sections 8-4 and 8-5, the planets in our solar
system formed as a natural consequence of the birth of the Sun.
We have also seen evidence suggesting that planetary formation
may be commonplace around single stars (see Figure 8-8). Many
astronomers suspect that most Sunlike stars probably have planets, and so they give fp a value of 1.
Unfortunately, the rest of the terms in the Drake equation are
very uncertain. Let’s play with some hypothetical values. The
chances that a planetary system has an Earthlike world suitable
for life are not known. Were we to consider our own solar system as representative, we could put ne at 1. Let’s be more conservative, however, and suppose that 1 in 10 solar-type stars is
orbited by a habitable planet, making ne = 0.1. From what we
know about the evolution of life on the Earth, we might assume
that, given appropriate conditions, the development of life is a
certainty, which would make fl ⫽ 1. This is an area of intense interest to astrobiologists.
For the sake of argument, we might also assume that evolution might naturally lead to the development of intelligence (a conjecture that is hotly debated) and also make fi ⫽ 1. It’s anyone’s
guess as to whether these intelligent extraterrestrial beings would
attempt communication with other civilizations in the Galaxy, but
were we to assume that they would, fc would be put at 1 also.
The last variable, L, involving the longevity of a civilization,
is the most uncertain of all. Looking at our own example, we see

Intelligent civilizations in our Milky Way Galaxy can evolve only in a
certain region called the galactic habitable zone. In that zone, a
suitable planet must lie within the planetary habitable zone of its
parent star. (After C. H. Lineweaver, Y. Fenner, and B. K. Gibson)

Galactic habitable zone

Too close to the center of the
Milky Way Galaxy:
• The distances between stars
are small, so there can be close
encounters between stars that
would disrupt a planetary
system.
• There are also frequent
outbursts of potentially lethal
radiation from supernovae and
from the supermassive black
hole at the very center of the
Galaxy.

Too far from the center of the
Milky Way Galaxy:
• Stars are deficient in elements
heavier than hydrogen and helium,
so they lack both the materials
needed to form Earthlike planets
and the chemical substances
required for life as we know it.

Planetary habitable zone

The Star:
• Must have a mass that is
neither too large, or too small.
• If the star’s mass is too
large, it will use up its
hydrogen fuel so rapidly that
it will burn out before life can
evolve on any of its planets.
• If the star’s mass is too
small, it will be too dim to
provide the warmth needed
for life.
The Neighborhood:
• There needs to be one or more
large Jovian planets whose
gravitational forces will clear
away comets and meteors.

756

The Planet:
• Must be a terrestrial planet with a
solid surface.
• Must have enough mass to provide
the gravity needed to retain an
atmosphere and oceans.
• Must be at a comfortable distance
from the star so that the temperatures
are neither too high nor too low.
• Must be in a stable, nearly circular
orbit. (A highly elliptical orbit would
cause excessively large temperature
swings as the planet moved toward
and away from the star.)

28-5 Radio searches for alien civilizations
are under way

Sadly, just one year after HRMS began operation in
1992, the U.S. Congress imposed a mandate requiring
that NASA no longer support HRMS or any other radio searches for extraterrestrial intelligence. This decision, which
was made on budgetary grounds, saved a few million dollars—an
entirely negligible amount compared to the total NASA budget.
Ironically, the senator who spearheaded this move was from the
state of Nevada, where tax dollars have been spent to signpost a
remote desert road as “The Extraterrestrial Highway.”

Even if only a few alien civilizations are scattered across the
Galaxy, we have the technology to detect radio transmissions
from them. But if other civilizations are trying to communicate
with us using radio waves, what frequency are they using? This
is an important question, because if we fail to tune our radio telescopes to the right frequency, we might never know whether the
aliens are out there.
A reasonable choice would be a frequency that is fairly free
of interference from extraneous sources. SETI pioneer Bernard
Oliver was the first to draw attention to a range of relatively
noise-free frequencies in the neighborhood of the microwave emis-

In other words, out of the hundreds of billions of stars in
the Galaxy, we would estimate that there are only 10 technologically advanced civilizations from which we might receive
communications.
A wide range of values has been proposed for the terms in
the Drake equation, and these various guesses produce vastly different estimates of N. Some scientists argue that there is exactly
one advanced civilization in the Galaxy and that we are it. Others speculate that there may be hundreds or thousands of planets
inhabited by intelligent creatures. If we wish to know whether our
Galaxy is devoid of other intelligence, teeming with civilizations,
or something in between, we must keep searching the skies.

This region of the microwave spectrum is called the water hole,
because H and OH together make H2O, or water.
In 1989, NASA began work on the High Resolution Microwave Survey (HRMS), an ambitious project to scan the entire
sky at frequencies spanning the water hole from 103 to 104 MHz.
HRMS would have observed more than 800 nearby solar-type
stars over a narrower frequency range in the hope of detecting
signals that were either pulsed (like Morse code) or continuous
(like the carrier wave for a TV or radio broadcast). The sophisticated signal-processing technology of HRMS would have been
able to sift through tens of millions of individual frequency channels simultaneously. It would even have been able to detect the
minute Doppler shifts in a signal coming from an alien planet as
that planet spun on its axis and moved around its star.

The Water Hole This graph shows the background noise level

so-called water hole is a range of radio frequencies from about
103 to 104 megahertz (MHz) in which there is little noise and
little absorption by the Earth’s atmosphere. Some scientists
suggest that this noise-free region would be well suited for
interstellar communication. Within the water hole itself, the
principal source of noise is the afterglow of the Big Bang, called
the cosmic microwave background. To put this graph in
perspective, a frequency of 100 MHz corresponds to “100” on a
FM radio, and 103 MHz is a frequency used for various types of
radar. (Adapted from C. Sagan and F. Drake)

28-6 Infrared telescopes in space will soon
begin searching for Earthlike planets
Although no longer involved in SETI, NASA is planning a major
effort to search for Earthlike planets suitable for the evolution of
an advanced civilization. Such a search poses a major challenge.
Astronomers have discovered many Jupiter-sized planets by detecting the “wobble” that these planets produce in their parent
star (see Section 8-6). But a planet the size of the Earth would exert only a weak gravitational force on its parent star, and the resulting “wobble” is too small for us to detect with present
technology. Earth-sized planets are also too dim to be seen in visible light against the glare of their parent star.

Searching for Planetary Transits
LINK 28

WEB

.15

An alternative technique will be used by an orbiting
telescope called Kepler, which is scheduled for launch
in 2008. If a star is orbited by a planet whose orbital
plane is oriented edge-on to our line of sight, once per orbit the
planet will pass in front of the star in an event called a transit.
This causes a temporary dimming of the light we see from that
star. As we discussed in Section 8-6, astronomers have used Earthbased telescopes to observe dimming of this kind from Jupiter-

Searching Using Images and Spectra
LINK 28

The results from Kepler may help astronomers select
stars to study in more detail using Darwin, a more advanced orbiting telescope under development by the
European Space Agency. Planned for a 2015 launch, Darwin will
search for Earthlike planets by detecting their infrared radiation.
The rationale is that stars like the Sun emit much less infrared radiation than visible light, while planets are relatively strong emitters of infrared. Hence, observing in the infrared makes it less
difficult (although still technically challenging) to detect planets
orbiting a star.
Darwin will also analyze the infrared spectra of any planets
that it finds, in the hope of seeing the characteristic absorption of
atmospheric gases such as ozone, carbon dioxide, and water vapor (Figure 28-11). The relative amounts of these gases, as determined from a planet’s spectrum, can reveal whether life is present
on that planet.
Darwin will need to achieve enough resolution to detect individual planets. One proposed mission design makes use of interferometry. We discussed this technique for improving the
resolution of telescopes in Section 6-6. By combining the light
from three widely spaced dishes, each at least 3 m in diameter,
Darwin will make the sharpest infrared images of any telescope
in history. NASA has proposed a similar planet-finding interferometry mission called Terrestrial Planet Finder, but the funding
for this mission is uncertain.
A more speculative project is an

A major challenge facing SETI is the tremendous
amount of computer time needed to analyze the mountains of data returned by radio searches. To this end,
scientists at the University of California, Berkeley, have recruited
nearly 5 million personal computer users to participate in a project called SETI@home. Each user receives actual data from a detector called SERENDIP IV (Search for Extraterrestrial Radio
Emissions from Nearby, Developed, Intelligent Populations) and
a data analysis program that also acts as a screensaver. When the
computer’s screensaver is on, the program runs, the data are analyzed, and the results are reported via the Internet to the researchers at Berkeley. The program then downloads new data to
be analyzed. As of 2006, SETI@home users had provided as much
computer time as a single computer working full-time for
2,000,000 years!
All current SETI projects make use of existing radio telescopes and must share telescope time with astronomical researchers.
But by 2008, the SETI Institute plans to have completed and put
into operation a radio telescope that will be dedicated solely to
the search for intelligent signals. This telescope, called the Allen
Telescope Array, will actually be hundreds of relatively small and
inexpensive radio dishes working together. Perhaps this new array will be the first to detect a signal from a distant civilization.

sized planets transiting their parent stars. To detect the much
slighter dimming caused by the transit of a small, Earth-sized
planet, Kepler will use specialized detectors. Furthermore, by observing from orbit using a telescope with a wide field of view,
Kepler will be able to continuously monitor thousands of stars at
once.
If Kepler detects stars that dim slightly as expected, astronomers will have to make sure that the dimming really is due
to a transiting planet and not some other cause. (One key test will
be whether the dimming repeats with a definite period, as would
be expected for a planet in a periodic orbit.) Once this is done,
astronomers will be able to determine the transiting planets’ sizes
(which determines how much dimming takes place), as well as the
sizes of their orbits (which can be calculated from Kepler’s third
law by using the orbital period of the planet, which is the same
as the time interval between successive transits). Given the distance from the planet to its parent star and the star’s luminosity,
astronomers will even be able to estimate the planet’s average
temperature.

direct successor to HRMS. When complete, this project will have
surveyed a thousand Sunlike stars within 200 light-years at millions of radio frequencies. At Harvard University, BETA (the
Billion-channel ExtraTerrestrial Assay) is scanning the sky at even
more individual frequencies within the water hole. Other multifrequency searches are being carried out under the auspices of the
University of Western Sydney in Australia and the University of
California.

technology needed for such an ambitious mission does not yet exist, but may become available within a few decades.
Sometime during the twenty-first century, missions such as
Darwin may answer the question “Are there worlds like Earth orbiting other stars?” If the answer is yes, radio searches for intelligent signals will gain even more impetus.
The potential rewards from such searches are great. Detecting a message from an alien civilization could dramatically change
the course of our own civilization, through the sharing of scientific information with another species or an awakening of social
or humanistic enlightenment. In only a few years our technology,
industry, and social structure might advance the equivalent of
centuries into the future. Such changes would touch every person
on the Earth. Mindful of these profound implications, scientists
push ahead with the search for extraterrestrial intelligence.

Key Ideas
Organic Molecules in the Universe: All life on Earth, and presumably on other worlds, depends on organic (carbon-based) molecules. These molecules occur naturally throughout interstellar
space.
• The organic molecules needed for life to originate were probably brought to the young Earth by comets or meteorites. Another

dioxide (CO2). While all these molecules can be created by nonbiological
processes, the presence of life will change the relative amounts of each
molecule in the planet’s atmosphere. Thus, the infrared spectrum of such
planets will make it possible to identify worlds on which life may have
evolved. (Jet Propulsion Laboratory)

likely source for organic molecules is chemical reactions in the
Earth’s primitive atmosphere. Similar processes may occur on
other worlds.
Life in the Solar System: Besides Earth, only two worlds in our
solar system—the planet Mars and Jupiter’s satellite Europa—
may have had the right conditions for the origin of life.
• Mars once had liquid water on its surface, though it has none
today. Life may have originated on Mars during the liquid water
era.
• The Viking Lander spacecraft searched for microorganisms on
the Martian surface, but found no conclusive sign of their presence. The unsuccessful Beagle 2 mission to Mars was to carry out
a different set of biological experiments on samples taken from
the interiors of rocks; these experiments may be attempted again
on a future mission.
• An ancient Martian rock that came to Earth as a meteorite
shows circumstantial evidence that microorganisms once existed on Mars. Additional rock samples are needed to provide
corroboration.
• Europa appears to have extensive liquid water beneath its icy
surface. Future missions may search for the presence of life there.
Radio Searches for Extraterrestrial Intelligence: Astronomers have
carried out a number of searches for radio signals from other
stars. No signs of intelligent life have yet been detected, but
searches are continuing and using increasingly sophisticated
techniques.
• The Drake equation is a tool for estimating the number of intelligent, communicative civilizations in our Galaxy.
Telescope Searches for Earthlike Planets: A new generation of orbiting telescopes may be able to detect terrestrial planets around
nearby stars. If such planets are found, their infrared spectra may
reveal the presence or absence of life.

It has been suggested that extraterrestrial civilizations would

Imagine that a civilization in another planetary system is
sending a radio signal toward Earth. As our planet moves in
its orbit around the Sun, the wavelength of the signal we receive will change due to the Doppler effect. This gives SETI

from interstellar signals. (a) Use the data in Appendix 1 to
calculate the speed of the Earth in its orbit. For simplicity, assume the orbit is circular. (b) If the alien civilization is transmitting at a frequency of 3000 MHz, what wavelength (in
meters) would we receive if the Earth were moving neither toward nor away from their planet? (c) The maximum Doppler
shift occurs if the Earth’s orbital motion takes it directly toward or directly away from the alien planet. How large is
that maximum wavelength shift? Express your answer both
in meters and as a percentage of the unshifted wavelength
you found in (b). (d) Discuss why it is important that SETI
radio receivers be able to measure frequency and wavelength
to very high precision.
Astronomers have proposed using interferometry to make an
extremely high-resolution telescope. This proposal involves
placing a number of infrared telescopes in space, separating
them by thousands of kilometers, and combining the light
from the individual telescopes. One design of this kind has an
effective diameter of 6000 km and uses infrared radiation
with a wavelength of 10 mm. If it is used to observe an Earthlike planet orbiting the star Epsilon Eridani, 3.22 parsecs
(10.5 light-years) from Earth, what is the size of the smallest

A Biologist’s View of Astrobiology
by Kevin W. Plaxco
n the early 1960s, flush with the excitement of Sputnik and
the first manned space missions, the Nobel Prize-winning
biologist Joshua Lederberg coined the word “exobiology”
to describe the scientific study of extraterrestrial life. But after
a brief flurry of popularity in the 1960s and 1970s (due partly
to the pioneering research and public outreach work of Carl
Sagan), exobiology fell out of fashion among scientists; it was,
after all, the only field of scientific study without any actual
subject material to research.
In the last decade, however, the field of astrobiology has
filled the void left by exobiology’s demise by being simultaneously more encompassing and more practical. Astrobiology removes exobiology’s distinction between life on earth and life
“out there” and focuses on broader, but more tractable, questions regarding the relationship between life (any life, anywhere) and the universe. In a nutshell, astrobiology uses our
significant (if incomplete) knowledge of life on Earth to address three broad questions about life in the universe:

I

• Which of the physical attributes of our universe were
necessary in order for it to support the origins and further
evolution of life?
• How did life arise and evolve on Earth, and how might it
have arisen and evolved elsewhere?
• Where else might life have arisen in our universe, and how
do we best search for it?
Much of the worth and appeal of astrobiology lie in the fact
that these questions, which are among the most fundamental
posed by science, address the most profound issues regarding
our origins and our nature.
Perhaps not surprisingly, some aspects of astrobiology are
far better understood than others. We understand, for example, the broad details of how the almost metal-free hydrogen
and helium left over after the Big Bang was enriched in the
metallic elements by fusion reactions occurring in the more
massive stars and how these elements—absolutely critical for
biology because only they support the complex chemistry re-

Prior to becoming a professor of biochemistry at the
University of California, Santa Barbara, Kevin Plaxco
earned his B.Sc. in chemistry from the University of
California at Riverside and his Ph.D. in molecular biology from the
California Institute of Technology. While his research focuses
predominantly on the study of proteins, the “macromolecular
machines” that perform the lion’s share of the action in our cells,
he has also performed NASA-funded research into methods for the
detection of extraterrestrial life. In addition, he teaches a course
in astrobiology and has published a popular science book on the
subject.

quired for life—were then returned to the cosmos in supernova
explosions. Similarly, we understand in detail how rocky
planets—which we see as potentially habitable—form out of
the dust and gas of prestellar nebulae. In contrast, however,
much of the biology in astrobiology remains speculative at
best. There is, for example, nothing even remotely resembling
consensus regarding how life first arose on Earth much less
how—or if—it might have arisen elsewhere in the cosmos.
Perhaps equally unsurprisingly, some branches of the astrobiology community are more “optimistic” than others. Astronomers generally view astrobiology in terms of the processes
by which potentially habitable planets form. As these processes
are reasonably well understood, astronomers tend to be rather
upbeat regarding the events surrounding life’s origins. The radio astronomer Frank Drake, who pioneered the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) in the 1960s, is a relatively
extreme example of this hopefulness: When trying to estimate
the number of intelligent, “communicating” civilizations in the
Galaxy, he assumed that rocky, water-soaked planets almost
invariably give rise to life. Biochemists, in contrast, tend to
view the key issues in astrobiology as relating to the first steps
in the origins of life—that is, the detailed processes by which
inanimate chemicals first combine to form a living, evolving,
self-replicating system. To date, about a half dozen theories
have been put forth to explain how this might have occurred
on Earth, but all are fraught with enormous scientific difficulties. Specifically, every single theory of the origins of life postulated to date either utterly lacks experimental evidence to
back it up or requires events that are so improbable they make
even the “astronomical” number of planets in the universe
look small by comparison. When faced with what is, in effect,
a complete unknown, biochemists tend to be much more cautious about estimating the probability of life arising and the
chances of our being alone in the cosmos. To quote Francis
Crick, co-discoverer of the structure of DNA, “We cannot decide whether the origin of life on Earth was an extremely unlikely event or almost a certainty, or any possibility in between
these two extremes.”
Irrespective of our degree of personal optimism or pessimism, though, no one would be more thrilled than us biologists by the detection of life that had arisen independently of
life on Earth. Such a find would revolutionize our field by providing the first, tangible evidence of whether there are viable
routes to the evolution of life other than the DNA/proteins/cells
path that it took on Earth. But even barring such a momentous discovery as the detection of extraterrestrial life, astrobiology still provides a significant service to biology: By placing
life into a broader context, astrobiology provides the perspective that we need in order to truly understand who we are and
where we come from.

Data in this table were compiled from SIMBAD database operated at the Centre de Données
Astronomiques de Strasbourg, France.
*A positive radial velocity means that the star is receding; a negative radial velocity means that the
star is approaching.
**This is a ratio of the star’s apparent brightness to that of Sirius, the brightest star in the night
sky.
Note: Acrux, or ␣ Cru (the brightest star in Crux, the Southern Cross) appears to the naked eye as
a star of apparent magnitude ⫹0.87, the same as Aldebaran. However, it does not appear in this
table because Acrux is actually a binary star system. The blue-white component stars of this binary
system have apparent magnitudes of ⫹1.4 and ⫹1.9, and so they are dimmer than any of the stars
listed here.
