NONDESTRUCTIVE EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS FOR
FRACTURE-CRITICAL METALLIC COMPONENTS

1.

SCOPE

1.1

Purpose

The purpose of this NASA Technical Standard is to establish the nondestructive evaluation
(NDE) requirements for any NASA system or component, flight or ground, where fracture
control is a requirement. This NASA Technical Standard defines the primary requirements for
NDE in support of NASA-STD-5019A, Fracture Control Requirements for Spaceflight
Hardware. NDE applied in-process for purposes of process control and NDE of damage tolerant
composites are not addressed in this document.
It is the policy of NASA to produce aerospace flight systems with a high degree of reliability and
safety. This is accomplished through good design, manufacturing, test, and operational practices,
including the judicious choice of materials, detailed analysis, appropriate factors of safety,
rigorous testing and control of hardware, and reliable inspection. NASA fracture control
requirements stipulate that all human-rated aerospace flight systems be subjected to fracture
control procedures to preclude catastrophic failure. Those procedures frequently rely on NDE to
ensure that the potential failure initiation of relevant crack-like flaws are not present in critical
areas.
Programs that are not human-rated may choose to impose these requirements on a mission or
hardware to bolster the program or to serve as a stepping-stone for human-rating.
1.2

Applicability

This NASA Technical Standard is applicable to the fracture control of metal components, e.g.,
aluminum, steel, titanium, and nickel alloys for any NASA system or component, flight or
ground, where fracture control is a requirement.
Conditional notes on applicability are presented in section 4.2.3.
The requirements described herein apply to fracture-critical hardware developed for NASA
applications by NASA Field Centers, international partners, contractors, and outside
organizations. NDE processes are required to meet the requirements in this NASA Technical
Standard to screen hardware reliably for the presence of crack-like flaws.
This NASA Technical Standard is approved for use by NASA Headquarters and NASA Centers
and Facilities, and applicable technical requirements may be cited in contract, program, and other
Agency documents. It may also apply to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (a Federally Funded
Research and Development Center (FFRDC)), other contractors, recipients of grants and
APPROVED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE – DISTRIBUTION IS UNLIMITED

NASA-STD-5009B
cooperative agreements, and parties to other agreements only to the extent specified or
referenced in applicable contracts, grants, or agreements.
Verifiable requirement statements are designated by the acronym NER (Nondestructive Evaluation
Requirement), numbered and indicated by the word “shall”; this NASA Technical Standard contains
96 requirements. Explanatory or guidance text is indicated in italics beginning in section 4. To
facilitate requirements selection and verification by NASA programs and projects, a Requirements
Compliance Matrix is provided in Appendix A.
1.3

Tailoring

Document tailoring of the requirements in this NASA Technical Standard for application to a
specific program or project as part of program or project requirements and obtain formal
approval by the delegated Technical Authority in accordance with NPR 7120.5, NASA Space
Flight Program and Project Management Requirements.
Technical Authority in this context may vary from program to program. In accordance with
NPR 7120.10, Technical Standards for NASA Programs and Projects, section 2.2.4, “The NASA
Chief Engineer, the Chief, Safety and Mission Assurance, and the Chief Health and Medical Officer
serve as or may delegate Technical Authority for all technical standards within their areas of
responsibility.”

NASA-STD-5009B
Cracks or Crack-Like Flaws: A discontinuity assumed to behave like a crack for
assessment of material or structural integrity.
Defect: One or more flaws whose aggregate size, shape, orientation, location, or
properties do not meet specified acceptance criteria and are rejectable.
Flaw: An imperfection or discontinuity that may be detectable by nondestructive
testing and is not necessarily rejectable. Examples of flaws in metallic include cracks, deep
scratches and sharp notches that behave like cracks, material inclusions, forging laps,
welding incomplete fusion, penetration, and slag or porosity with a crack-like tail. For
additive manufactured metallics, skipped layers, thermal or stress induced cracks, or
inclusions, as examples.
Fracture Control: The rigorous application of those branches of design engineering,
quality assurance, manufacturing, and operations dealing with the analysis and prevention
of crack propagation leading to catastrophic failure.
Fracture-Critical Hardware, Component, or Part: Classification that assumes that
cracks in the hardware, component, or part could lead to a catastrophic failure, an event
that results in loss of life, serious personal injury, loss of the manned flight system, or
national asset.
Hardware Developer: The organization, NASA or prime contractor, responsible
for the design, development, and manufacturing of hardware that is subject to fracture
control.
Initial Crack (Flaw) Size: The crack size that is assumed to exist in the part for
damage tolerance analysis.
Instrument Calibration: Comparison of an instrument response with, or
adjustment of an instrument response to, known references often traceable to the National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). This is usually performed periodically,
typically at a 1-year interval. After completing calibration, a calibration sticker with
calibration expiration date is affixed to the instrument.
Instrument Standardization: Adjustment of an NDE instrument response using an
appropriate reference standard with known size discontinuities such as electro-discharged
machined slots and flat bottom holes, to obtain or establish a known and reproducible
response. This is usually done prior to an examination but can be carried out anytime
there is concern about the examination or instrument response. It is also commonly
known as calibration prior to initiating an NDE procedure. Instrument standardization
should be carried out using a minimum of three data points demonstrating expected
correlation between signal response and discontinuity size.

NASA-STD-5009B
Material Review Board (MRB): After non-conforming material has been
identified, this board reviews it and determines whether or not the material should be
returned, reworked, used as-is, or scrapped. Note: The MRB consists of representatives
across many disciplines, including manufacturing engineering, materials engineering,
Quality, etc.
Minimum Detectable Crack (Flaw) Size: The size of the smallest statistically
based crack-like flaw that can be reliably detected by Standard NDE methods and that is
assumed to exist in a part for the purpose of performing a damage tolerance safe-life
analysis of the part, component, or assembly.
NDE Plan: A plan that describes the process for establishment, implementation,
and control of NDE of aerospace flight hardware during design, manufacturing, and its
operational life.
NDE Procedure: A written plan providing detailed information on “how-to”
perform a hardware-specific inspection.
NDE Reference Standard: A material or object for which all relevant chemical
and physical characteristics are known and measurable, used as a comparison for, or
standardization of, equipment or instruments used for nondestructive testing.
90/95 Probability of Detection (POD 90/95): Refers to 90 percent probability of
flaw detection with 95 percent lower confidence bound.
Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE), Nondestructive Inspection (NDI),
Nondestructive Testing (NDT): The development and application of technical methods
to examine materials or components in ways that do not impair future usefulness and
serviceability in order to detect, locate, measure, and evaluate flaws; to assess integrity,
properties, and composition; and to measure geometrical characteristics.
POD Qualification (Qualified) Flaw Size: Qualification flaw size is declared after
a successful completion of POD demonstration test. It takes into account the reliably
detectable flaw size, material conditions, and flaw aspect ratios. Qualification flaw sizes
may be used in fracture mechanics analysis. Minimum detectable flaw size is the qualified
flaw size for Standard NDE.
Qualification: The skills, training, knowledge, examinations, experience, and
visual capability required for personnel to properly perform to a particular level.
Reference Document: Written, printed, or electronic matter that is useful as
background information for the reader to help in understanding the subject matter but
does not constitute technical requirements of the NASA Technical Standard.

and magnetic particle methods employing techniques with established capabilities.
Sustaining Engineering: The organization, NASA or prime contractor,
responsible for operation and maintenance of hardware that is subject to fracture control.
Technical Authority: A representative delegated by the contracting agency to
address technical matters and who is responsible for the interpretation and
implementation of the requirements set forth in this NASA Technical Standard.

4.1.8

Organizational Guidelines and Documentation Requirement

It is recommended that a document be developed that meets the intent of the responsibilities and
authorities described in Appendix B.
4.2

Standard NDE

[NER 21] Standard NDE shall consist of formal nondestructive inspections of fracture-critical
hardware using the NDE methods cited in Table 1, Minimum Detectable Crack Sizes for
Fracture Analysis Based on Standard NDE Methods (inches), or Table 2, Minimum Detectable
Crack Sizes for Fracture Analysis Based on Standard NDE Methods (millimeters).
The minimum detectable crack sizes shown in Table 1 and Table 2 can be assumed as starting
points in the damage tolerance fracture analyses and are applicable only for metals. The crack
geometries for the cracks in Table 1 or Table 2 are shown in Figure 1, Assumed Flaw
Geometries.
4.2.1

Standard NDE Methods

[NER 22] Standard NDE methods shall be limited to eddy current, fluorescent penetrant,
magnetic particle, radiography, and ultrasound.
4.2.2

Standard NDE Crack Sizes

4.2.2.1
[NER 23] Nondestructive inspections of fracture-critical hardware shall detect the
initial crack sizes used in the damage tolerance fracture analyses with a capability of 90/95
(90 percent probability of detection at a 95 percent confidence level).
See section 4.2.7 for deviations from this requirement.
The minimum detectable crack sizes for the Standard NDE methods shown in Table 1 and Table
2 are based principally on an NDE capability study that was conducted on flat, fatigue-cracked
2219-T87 aluminum panels early in the Space Shuttle program, and meet the 90/95 capability
requirement. Although many other similar capability studies and tests have been conducted
since, in our estimation, none have universal application, neither individually nor in
combination. Conducting an ideal NDE capability demonstration where all of the variables are
tested is obviously unmanageable and impractical.
APPROVED FOR PUBLIC RELEASE – DISTRIBUTION IS UNLIMITED
17 of 55

NASA-STD-5009B
In order to make the broadest use of NDE flaw detectability data in Table 1 or Table 2, good
engineering judgment needs to be applied and should be supported by specific documented
analysis of the applicability or variance. For example, a flat panel is representative of a
component with a large diameter curvature. It is also reasonable to use the Table 1 or Table 2
data values for most aerospace structural alloys such as titanium or stainless steel.
4.2.2.2
Regardless of the level of capability required of an inspection, the application of NDE
generally requires that the surfaces to be inspected are clean, smooth, and accessible.
Component features such as sharp radii, tight fillets, recesses, poor surface finish, poor
cleanliness, non-traditional material selection, and other conditions can detrimentally influence
the capability of the applied Standard NDE method.

4.2.3

Table 1 (or Table 2) —Minimum Detectable Flaw Sizes Conditional Notes

Since the Table 1 or Table 2 crack sizes were derived from a limited set of specimens of simple
geometry, applying the crack sizes to complex geometries, other materials, material forms,
material processes, and nonstandard NDE applications should be done with caution. Where the
real inspection conditions deviate significantly from the concept of flat fatigue-cracked panel
inspections, the transferability or similarity of the application of the Table 1 or Table 2 crack
sizes to real inspection situations should be evaluated and verified by documented evidence, such
as experimental data or other available test data documentation; for example, a demonstration
using penetrant, where capillary action is compared using penetrant on a curved part and then a
flat part. Similarity can be established by other studies, data, or by supportable rationale.
Similarity considerations should meet the intent of MIL-HDBK-1823, Nondestructive Evaluation
System Reliability Assessment.
If similarity cannot be established, additional tests may be required, including Standard or
Special NDE demonstration tests (see section 4.3). The values listed in Table 1 and Table 2 may
not apply to thick-section components; threaded parts; weldments; compressively loaded
structures; double wall radiography; and other unique material, structural, or inspection
applications.

Demonstration of Standard NDE Capability

a. [NER 26] NDE procedure calibration or instrument standardization on simulated or
real crack-like flaws shall satisfy the demonstrated detection of the minimum detectable crack
size (as long as the requirements in this section for each method are also adhered to).

Special NDE

4.3.1

General

Special NDE consists of nondestructive inspections that are capable of detecting crack-like flaws
smaller than those detectable by Standard NDE (Table 1 or Table 2) or those that do not
conform to the requirements for Standard NDE given in section 4.2, Standard NDE.
Special NDE methods are not limited to fluorescent penetrant, radiography, ultrasonic, eddy
current, and magnetic particle methods.

[NER 74] Special NDE inspections shall require the approval of the RFCB and the delegated
Technical Authority.

Demonstration of Special NDE Capability

[NER 75] A 90/95 percent flaw detection capability shall be demonstrated before a Special

method.
d. [NER 79] Special NDE Capability demonstration planning shall be approved by
NDE engineering.
4.3.4

NDE Capability Demonstration Specimens

The most accepted method of demonstrating Special NDE capability is with fatigue-cracked
specimens. The preparation and control of demonstration specimens and how to administer
demonstration tests should meet the intent of MIL-HDBK-1823. In special cases, other flaws or
crack types that are more representative of the application may be used for the demonstration
with the approval of the RFCB and the delegated Technical Authority.
a. [NER 80] Special NDE demonstration specimen selection shall be justified and
approved based on the similarity between the test hardware and the demonstration specimen.
b. [NER 81] The justification shall be documented in the NDE summary report.
4.3.5

Point Estimate Method

The Point Estimate Method approach assumes that the capability of flaw detection increases
with the size of flaws in the neighborhood of the test flaw size. Since only a reliably detectable
crack-like flaw size needs to be determined, a smaller number of crack-like flaws can be used to
demonstrate capability.
4.3.5.1 [NER 82] The Point Estimate Method assumption shall be demonstrated or verified
by documented evidence before the Point Estimate Method can be implemented.
Qualification by this method supports that the procedure and the individual operators are
capable of detecting qualification size flaws with minimum 90% POD with 95% confidence.
Successful point estimate demonstration involves detection of 29 flaws out of 29 flaw
opportunities or minimum 45 flaws out of 46 flaw opportunities. A 90/95 minimum flaw size is
given by the average flaw size in that study. (This assertion is postulated in a JSC study by A.
Koshti (2015).)
4.3.5.2
[NER 83] Use of the Point Estimate Method shall be in accordance with approaches
like those referenced in Materials Evaluation, Vol. 40, No. 9, pp 922-932, 1982.

4.3.6

POD Method

This method requires a large range of flaw sizes that span the targeted qualification flaw size.
The large number of flaws required by this method usually allows determination of a reliably
detectable flaw size a90/95. Qualification by this method demonstrates that the procedure and the
individual operator are capable of reliably detecting flaws larger than or equal to the
qualification flaw size. Use of the POD method should meet the intent of MIL-HDBK-1823,
ASTM E3023, and ASTM E2862, as approved by the responsible NDE Engineering
Organization, with the added requirements of validation of the model output and the assumptions
behind each model.
[NER 84] In all POD approaches, the probability of a false call and the single-sided upper 95
percent bound shall be defined.
The false call rates for binomial analyses typically require no greater than 3.44 percent while a
logit POD model requires no more than 5 percent. In the point estimate approach, this is
conservatively 3 times as many blank inspection sites as there are flaw sites. In that case, it
would be 87 blank inspection sites required for 29 flaws.
